The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to insert each of the two mutations (p.A244G and p.V317I) in the PINK1 cDNA with a 3' HA-tag, and the entire coding region was sequenced to confirm the presence of each mutation. Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 expression vectors encoding the wild-type or mutant proteins, or with the empty vector (control), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)."
