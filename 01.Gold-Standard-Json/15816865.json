Cells were transfected with either pcDNA3-parkin (wild-type or various mutants) or empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000. For sequential detergent extraction, cells were scraped and lysed in Triton X-100 buffer, centrifuged, and the supernatant (S) was collected. The pellet was then sequentially extracted with SDS and RIPA buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were probed with anti-parkin antibody (HRP-conjugated) and detected by chemiluminescence. Proteasome inhibition was assessed by treating cells with 10 µM lactacystin for 16 hours prior to lysis. To analyze protein solubility in PBS, Triton X-100-resistant pellets were washed and sonicated in PBS."
