The far-UV CD spectra of the M26I mutant is similar in shape to that of the wild-type protein but reproducibly exhibit a decreased signal amplitude. The M26I mutant also exhibits a decreased ability to dimerize, a decrease in secondary structure, a decreased stability relative to the wild-type protein, and the formation of both an altered dimer and higher order oligomers."

The far-UV CD spectra of the D149A mutant is similar in shape to that of the wild-type protein but reproducibly exhibit a decreased signal amplitude, with the effect being most pronounced for the D149A mutant. Alteration of D149 to alanine leads to shifts in resonances originating from the two other strands in the three-stranded sheet ( β -strands 8 and 9) as well as in strands 11 and 7, located at the adjacent end of the parallel sheet. The loops between α -helix 6 and β -strand 8 and between β -strands 10 and 11 are also affected."
