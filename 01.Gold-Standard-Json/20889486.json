FLAG-Parkin(C289G) was expressed at slightly lower levels than Parkin(WT) and was strongly aggregation-prone. FLAG-Parkin(C289G) formed multiple large inclusions throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in approximately 86% of cells. The RING1 domain mutant FLAG-Parkin(C289G) failed to redistribute to damaged mitochondria and could not induce mitophagy. FLAG-Parkin(C289G) and myc-HSJ1a(WT) co-expression partially rescued the relocation of FLAG-Parkin(C289G) to damaged mitochondria, with overlapping staining observed in many cells (37% after 8 h)."

Parkin(R42P) aggregated into multiple small perinuclear inclusions in approximately 22% of cells. Despite this, FLAG-Parkin(R42P) was still capable of folding sufficiently to be recruited to mitochondria and retained its ability to mediate mitochondrial clustering."
