Our previous report showed that I93M transgenic mice develop dopaminergic neuronal cell death (Setsuie et al., 2007). We also reported that the I93M mutation causes aberrant molecular properties of UCH-L1, such as increased insolubility, decreased interaction with monoubiquitin and elevated interaction with other proteins (Kabuta et al., 2008a,b).",
