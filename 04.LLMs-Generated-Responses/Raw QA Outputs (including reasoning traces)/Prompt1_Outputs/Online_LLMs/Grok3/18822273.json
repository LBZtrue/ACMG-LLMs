The E163K mutation is causal of early-onset disease with clinical presentations more extensive than other DJ-1 mutations, including parkinsonism, dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

It specifies DJ-1's role in protecting against multiple cellular stresses, particularly oxidative stress, which is relevant to the functional assays described."

The disease mechanism is well-defined, and the assays (cell viability under stress and localization studies) are applicable to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Basic controls (WT DJ-1, native cells) and replicates are adequately included. However, the absence of variant-specific controls (known pathogenic/benign variants tested in parallel) limits the strength to supporting level per ACMG guidelines. Key findings include the E163K mutant's specific loss of protection against oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial redistribution, supporting a pathogenic role."
