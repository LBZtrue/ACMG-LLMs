Our data implicate fibrillization of a-syn and tau in the pathogenesis of PD, and suggest that distinct amyloidogenic proteins may cross-seed each other in neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "reasoning": "The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism as involving fibrillization of a-synuclein (a-syn) and tau proteins, linking the A53T mutation to enhanced fibril formation and accumulation of insoluble proteins in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology."
