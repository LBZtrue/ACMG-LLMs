Loss of DJ-1 function was considered to cause the phenotype... loss of protective activity of DJ-1 from neuro-toxicity induced by these stresses contributes to neuronal cell death in AR-EOP with mutant DJ-1.",

The assays used are relevant to the disease mechanism of AR-EOP, involving loss of protective function against stress-induced neuronal cell death. Basic controls and replicates were adequately described. However, the lack of additional variant controls limits the strength to supporting level, as per the ACMG flowchart."
