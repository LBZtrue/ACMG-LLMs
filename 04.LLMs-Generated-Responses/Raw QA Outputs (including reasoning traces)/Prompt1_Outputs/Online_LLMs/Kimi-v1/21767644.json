The study demonstrates that the overexpression of human mutant A30P α-syn in olfactory bulb DAergic cells downregulates olfactory DA content and leads to hyperactivity in transgenic animals under novel and stressful conditions, which can be partly ameliorated after cessation of transgenic expression. These findings align with the expected outcomes of a pathogenic variant and provide strong evidence for the pathogenic nature of the A30P mutation."
