The study demonstrates that overexpression of this variant leads to excessive autophagy, mitochondrial removal, and net mitochondrial loss, which are associated with a bioenergetic deficit and neuronal degeneration. These findings are consistent with a very strong pathogenic evidence strength (PS3) according to the ACMG guidelines."
