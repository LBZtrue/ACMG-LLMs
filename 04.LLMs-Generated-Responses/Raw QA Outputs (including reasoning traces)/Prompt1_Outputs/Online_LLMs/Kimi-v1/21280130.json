Three separate mutations (A30P, E46K, and A53T) as well as duplications or triplications of the αS gene, which increase levels of αS with no alteration in sequence, cause PD.",

However, it does describe the application of an optimized method for H/D exchange and two-dimensional proton-detected HRMAS experiments, which suggests the use of a validated assay technique. Given the lack of specific details on controls and replicates, we cannot proceed to further sub-steps and thus do not apply PS3/BS3."

The data suggest that the A30P mutation does not cause changes in the number, location, and overall arrangement of β-strands in amyloid fibrils of αS, indicating that the increased pathogenicity related to the familial A30P mutation is unlikely to be caused by a mutation-induced change in the conformation of αS aggregates. Therefore, the functional evidence does not support the use of PS3/BS3 for this variant."
