The study demonstrates that the E46K mutation alters the ion channel properties of α-syn, including conductance and dwell times, which are key functional parameters related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The use of both wild-type and mutant proteins, along with controls and detailed statistical analysis, provides strong supporting evidence for the pathogenic effect of this variant."
