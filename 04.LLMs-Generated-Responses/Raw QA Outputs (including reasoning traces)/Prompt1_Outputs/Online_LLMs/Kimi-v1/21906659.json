The evidence is based on the inducible model of α-syn expression in rat PC12/TetOn cells, which demonstrates the effects of the A30P mutation on α-syn aggregation, toxicity, and degradation pathways. The statistical analyses provided in the paper further support the interpretation of the functional data, leading to a supporting strength rating for pathogenicity."
