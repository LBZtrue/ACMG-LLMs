The assays used are relevant to the disease mechanism, show significant changes in mitochondrial function and ROS production, and provide a clear pathogenic effect. The statistical analysis supports the interpretation of these changes as being due to the W437X mutation, leading to the assignment of PS3 very strong evidence for pathogenicity."
