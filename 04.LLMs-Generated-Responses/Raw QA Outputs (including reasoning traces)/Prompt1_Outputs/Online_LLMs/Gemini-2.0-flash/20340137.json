Such alterations may be involved in pathology through structural changes or overexpression of the protein leading to protein aggregation, as well as through impaired gene expression.",

Here, we provide evidence that: (1) SNCA shows monoallelic expression in this patient, (2) epigenetic silencing of the mutated allele involves histone modifications but not DNA methylation, and (3) steady-state mRNA levels deriving from the normal SNCA allele in this patient exceed those of the two normal SNCA alleles combined, in matching, control individuals.",

To this end, we compared the SNCA mRNA levels in our patient to that of the control, normal individual, using RNA from immortalized B-lymphocytes. Our results with quantitative RT-PCR show that the mRNA in the control ranged from 65.1% to 86.2% of the mRNA of the patient, documenting an increase of total mRNA in the patient between 14% and 35% of that of the normal individual (Fig. 3A).",

However, this is limited to PS3_supporting due to the comparison against only a single control individual without strong statistical analysis."
