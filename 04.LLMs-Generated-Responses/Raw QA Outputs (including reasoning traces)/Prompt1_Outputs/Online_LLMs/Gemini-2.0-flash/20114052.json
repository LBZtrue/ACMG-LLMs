          "reasoning": "The general class of assay used, assessing ion channel formation, is applicable to the disease mechanism. The paper investigates how the E46K variant affects the formation of these channels and their properties, directly relating to the 'channelopathy mechanism'."

Channels with defined conductance states were observed in the presence of a trans-potential for wt proteins (Fig. 6a; -30 mV), whereas E46K channels (Fig. 6b; -30 mV) were spontaneously active at 0 mV.",

Since the assay is valid, has basic controls and replicates, and no additional pathogenic or benign variants are used as controls, the final functional evidence strength is PS3_supporting."
