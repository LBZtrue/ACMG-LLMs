Another common feature of Parkinson disease (PD) is mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we provide evidence that the overactivation of autophagy may be a link that connects the intracellular accumulation of a-synuclein with mitochondrial dysfunction.",

The variant controls are appropriate (WT vs A53T mutant). However, without sufficient statistical analysis to provide an OddsPath calculation and the lack of clearly defined >=11 bening/pathogenic variant controls in the experiment results in a final classification of PS3_supporting."
