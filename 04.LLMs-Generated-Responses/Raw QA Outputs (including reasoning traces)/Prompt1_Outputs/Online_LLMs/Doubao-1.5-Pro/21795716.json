There is accumulating evidence implicating oxidative stress, and increased deposition of iron was found in PD brains. Mutations in α -synuclein, including A53T, have been linked to familial forms of PD. It is suggested that the tendency of α -synuclein to misfold and aggregate may underlie its involvement in Lewy body formation and PD.",

Basic controls, replicates, and variant controls were present. Statistical analyses were sufficient, and although no direct OddsPath was given, the significant differences in cell viability, oxidative stress, and autophagy between A53T - expressing cells and controls suggest a moderate pathogenic effect, thus assigning a PS3_moderate strength."
