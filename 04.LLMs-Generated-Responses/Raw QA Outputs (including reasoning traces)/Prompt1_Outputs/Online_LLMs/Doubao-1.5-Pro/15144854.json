Mutations in the a - synuclein (a - syn) gene are responsible for a rare familial parkinsonism syndrome. The pathological hallmark of PD is the deposition of filamentous insoluble proteins in the form of cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs) or inclusions in neuronal processes known as Lewy neurites (LNs) or spheroids. a - Syn - positive inclusions in these diseases correlate with the accumulation of insoluble a - syn protein with an altered conformation.",
