Mutations in the parkin (PARK2) gene, which encodes a ubiquitin ligase, are a major cause of familial PD. The ubiquitin - proteasome system, in which parkin functions, is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis by clearing unwanted proteins. Many parkin mutations may lead to loss of function, potentially through protein misfolding and aggregation.",
