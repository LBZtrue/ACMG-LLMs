A UCH - L1 mutation at position 93 (I93M) was found in two affected siblings of a German family with PD. I93M transgenic mice develop dopaminergic neuronal cell death. The I93M mutation causes aberrant molecular properties of UCH - L1, such as increased insolubility, decreased interaction with monoubiquitin and elevated interaction with other proteins, suggesting that I93M UCH - L1 plays a causative role in familial PD.",

It uses transfection of plasmids expressing wild - type and mutant UCH - L1 (including I93M) in Neuro - 2a cells and primary - cultured hippocampal neurons, followed by immunoblotting to detect the secreted protein in the medium. The assay aims to determine if the I93M mutation affects the secretion of UCH - L1, which is relevant as the secretion of UCH - L1 could be involved in the pathology of PD.",
