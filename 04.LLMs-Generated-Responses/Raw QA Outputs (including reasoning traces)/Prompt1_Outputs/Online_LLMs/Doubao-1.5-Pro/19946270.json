In cancer, PARK2 mutations abrogate the growth - suppressive effects of the PARK2 protein, decrease its E3 ligase activity, and compromise its ability to ubiquitinate cyclin E, resulting in mitotic instability. PARK2 is a tumor suppressor on 6q25.2 - q27.",

These assays are used to study the growth - suppressive properties of PARK2 and the effects of its mutations on ubiquitination and cyclin E regulation.",
