Mutations in PINK1 are associated with PARK6. Cell culture studies suggest that PINK1 is mitochondrially located and may exert a protective effect on the cell that is abrogated by the mutations, resulting in increased susceptibility to cellular stress.",

Mitochondrial membrane potential is central to mitochondrial biology and is related to PD pathogenesis as mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event in PD.
