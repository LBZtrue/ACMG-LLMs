          "extracted_paper_info": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the gene responsible for autosomal dominant PD. The true physiological function or the mechanism of neurodegeneration resulting from the mutation has not been conclusively clarified, but hyper - kinase activity of mutant LRRK2 molecules may be one possible mechanism for the pathogenesis. For I2020T mutation, there is controversy regarding its kinase activity. The present study suggests that higher susceptibility of I2020T mutant LRRK2 to intracellular degradation than the wild - type molecule may be one of the mechanisms involved in the neurodegeneration associated with this LRRK2 mutation.",

It also explores the role of kinase activity and degradation in the disease mechanism, clearly defining relevant aspects of the disease mechanism related to the variant's functional assay.",
