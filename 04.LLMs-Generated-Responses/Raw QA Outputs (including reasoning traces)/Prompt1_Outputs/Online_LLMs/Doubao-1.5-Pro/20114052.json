The ability of α - syn oligomers to form ionic channels is postulated as a channelopathy mechanism in human brain. The E46K mutation is linked to a familial form of PD.",

                    "reasoning": "The paper clearly states that α - syn is involved in PD pathogenesis and the E46K mutation is associated with a familial form of PD, and the channel - forming ability of α - syn oligomers is part of the proposed disease mechanism.",

The assays used were applicable to the disease mechanism, basic controls and replicates were present, and a benign variant (wt α - syn) was used as a control. However, due to the lack of statistical analyses for calculating OddsPath and the small number (2) of variant controls, the functional evidence strength is PS3_supporting."
