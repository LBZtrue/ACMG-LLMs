### 解释

1. **变异体提取和识别**：
   - 提取了两个变异体：`DJ-1 M26I` 和 `DJ-1 L166P`。

2. **功能证据评估**：
   - **疾病机制定义**：论文明确描述了帕金森病（PD）的分子基础以及DJ-1在其中的作用。
   - **适用性评估**：使用了蛋白互作实验（如共免疫沉淀、pull-down实验）和细胞存活实验（如MTT实验、PARP切割、caspase 3激活），这些实验有效地模拟了疾病发病机制。
   - **具体实验实例的有效性评估**：实验中包含了基本对照（野生型DJ-1和空载体）并进行了多次重复实验。
   - **个体变异解释**：M26I和L166P变异体均表现出与TTRAP更强的结合，并阻断了TTRAP的保护作用，导致促凋亡效应，且这些发现得到了统计分析的支持。

3. **最终证据强度**：
   - 对于两个变异体，最终的功能证据强度均为`PS3_moderate`，表明它们具有中等强度的致病性证据。

4. **总体结论**：
   - M26I和L166P变异体均展示了通过增强TTRAP结合并诱导细胞凋亡的获得功能效应，这一结论得到了多次实验和统计分析的支持。
