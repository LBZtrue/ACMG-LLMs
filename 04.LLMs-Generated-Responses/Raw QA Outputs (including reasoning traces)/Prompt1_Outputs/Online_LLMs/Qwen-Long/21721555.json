#### 文献来源：21721555.pdf

**研究背景：**
该研究探讨了人类和小鼠α-synuclein（αSyn）在帕金森病（PD）中的聚集动力学差异，特别是A53T突变对聚集速率的影响。

**主要发现：**
1. **A53T突变**：A53T突变在控制生长速率方面起主导作用，而滞后时间则受A53T和S87N突变的共同影响。
2. **生长速率**：含有A53的人类序列变体比含有T53的小鼠序列变体生长速率更慢。
3. **滞后时间**：A53T和S87N突变在滞后时间上表现出协同效应，其中N端和NAC区域的组合影响显著。

### 总结

通过上述分析，我们为两个关键变体（A53T和S87N）提供了详细的评估，并根据ACMG功能证据评估流程确定了它们的致病性强度。A53T变体被归类为中等强度致病性（PS3_moderate），而S87N变体被归类为支持性致病性（PS3_supporting）。这些结论基于论文中的实验数据和统计分析。
