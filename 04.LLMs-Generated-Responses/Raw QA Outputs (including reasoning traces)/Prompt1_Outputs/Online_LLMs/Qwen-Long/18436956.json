### 解释：
1. **提取功能数据**：对于每个变异（L166P、E64D、M26I、A104T 和 D149A），我们从文献中提取了其功能影响的具体描述。
2. **解析变异识别信息**：确定了基因（DJ-1）、蛋白质变化（参考氨基酸、替代氨基酸和位置）以及组合的变异字符串ID。
3. **应用ACMG功能证据评估流程图**：按照流程图逐步评估每个变异的功能证据。
4. **确定功能证据强度**：根据评估结果，确定每个变异的功能证据强度（PS3或BS3及其强度等级）。
5. **输出结果**：以pyJSON格式输出，包括每一步的判断过程和最终的证据强度评级。

这个JSON对象详细记录了对每个变异的功能评估过程，确保了评估的透明性和可追溯性。
