### 解释
1. **Variant Extraction**:
   - **PINK1 G309D** 和 **PINK1 L347P** 是文献中提到的两个突变位点。

2. **Functional Evidence Aim**:
   - 目的是评估这些突变是否具有致病性（Pathogenic）。

3. **Assessment Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: 定义疾病机制。文献明确指出PINK1是一种线粒体导向的蛋白激酶，其突变与隐性帕金森病相关，涉及黑质多巴胺能神经元的丧失。
   - **Step 2**: 评估实验方法的有效性。研究使用了自磷酸化实验和体外激酶活性检测，以及在哺乳动物细胞中的表达水平和定位检测。
   - **Step 3**: 评估具体实验实例的有效性。野生型PINK1和激酶死亡突变体作为对照，实验重复多次。
   - **Step 4**: 应用证据进行个体变异解释。统计分析显示G309D突变导致激酶活性显著下降（60.5%），而L347P突变导致激酶活性大幅下降（<10%），且蛋白质不稳定。

4. **Final Evidence Strength**:
   - **PINK1 G309D**: 支持致病性（PS3_supporting）。
   - **PINK1 L347P**: 中等强度支持致病性（PS3_moderate）。

5. **Overall Conclusion**:
   - 对于G309D突变，激酶活性有轻微下降，支持其致病性。
   - 对于L347P突变，激酶活性和蛋白质稳定性大幅下降，强烈支持其致病性。
