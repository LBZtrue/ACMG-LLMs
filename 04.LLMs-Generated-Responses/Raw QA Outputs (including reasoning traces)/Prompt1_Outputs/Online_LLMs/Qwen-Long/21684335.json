为了从提供的科学论文文本中提取有关每个变异体的功能数据，并按照要求的格式输出结果，我将逐一分析提到的变异体，并应用ACMG功能证据评估流程。以下是详细的分析过程和最终的JSON格式输出。

### 分析过程

#### 1. 提取相关功能证据细节
从论文中提取每个变异体的功能数据，包括其对α-synuclein聚集、二级结构变化、寡聚化等的影响。

#### 2. 解析变异体识别信息
提取基因名称、蛋白质变化（参考氨基酸、替代氨基酸、位置）以及组合的`variant_string_id`。

#### 3. 应用ACMG功能证据评估流程
根据提取的信息逐步评估每个变异体的功能证据强度。

#### 4. 确定功能证据的强度
根据ACMG标准确定每个变异体的功能证据是支持致病性（PS3）还是良性（BS3），并给出强度等级。

#### 5. 输出结果为pyJSON格式

以下是具体的分析结果：
