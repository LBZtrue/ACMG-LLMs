根据提供的文档内容，我将按照要求提取和整理有关变异体的功能证据，并进行评估。以下是提取的信息：

### 文档1：《12446870.pdf》
#### 变异体信息：
1. **基因**: DJ-1
2. **蛋白质变化**:
   - 荷兰家族：缺失突变（基因组删除）
   - 意大利家族：点突变（T3C转换，导致Leu166Pro）

#### 功能数据：
- **荷兰家族**：
  - 存在一个同源基因组删除，影响了DJ-1基因的表达。
  - 删除完全与疾病等位基因共分离。
  - 删除仅限于DJ-1基因，其他基因未受影响。
  
- **意大利家族**：
  - 存在一个点突变（T3C转换），导致Leu166Pro。
  - 突变完全与疾病等位基因共分离。
  - 突变后的DJ-1蛋白在细胞质中主要与线粒体共定位，而在野生型中则呈现弥漫性胞浆和核染色。
