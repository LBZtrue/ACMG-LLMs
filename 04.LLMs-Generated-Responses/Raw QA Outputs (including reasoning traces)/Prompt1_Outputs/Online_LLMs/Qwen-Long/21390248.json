### 解释

1. **变体信息提取**：从论文中提取了每个变体（S935A、R1441G、Y1699C、G2019S）的具体信息，包括基因名称、氨基酸变化和位置。
2. **功能证据评估**：根据ACMG功能证据评估流程，逐步分析每个变体的功能实验设计和结果。
3. **最终证据强度**：基于评估步骤中的判断，确定每个变体的功能证据强度（PS3或BS3），并给出最终结论。

### 结论

每个变体的功能实验设计合理，使用了适当的对照和统计分析，支持其在帕金森病中的致病性。其中，S935A、R1441G和Y1699C变异被评估为中等致病性（PS3_moderate），而G2019S变异被评估为支持致病性（PS3_supporting）。
