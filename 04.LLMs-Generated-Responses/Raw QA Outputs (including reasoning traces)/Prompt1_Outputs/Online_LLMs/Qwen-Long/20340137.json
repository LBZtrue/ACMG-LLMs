为了从提供的科学论文文本中提取信息，并按照您的要求进行功能证据评估，我将针对每个提到的基因变异执行以下步骤：

1. **提取相关功能证据细节**：从文中提取有关每个变异的功能数据。
2. **解析变异识别信息**：填充“Gene”、“Protein Change”（参考氨基酸、替代氨基酸、位置）和“variant_string_id”字段。
3. **应用ACMG功能证据评估流程图**：对每个变异的功能证据进行评估。
4. **确定功能证据的强度**：根据ACMG标准，确定是支持致病性（PS3）还是良性（BS3）的证据。
5. **以pyJSON格式输出结果**：包括逐步判断过程和最终的强度评级。

以下是基于第一个文档《20340137.pdf》中的信息，对两个主要提到的变异进行的评估：
