### 解释：
1. **variant_id**：每个变异体的基本信息，包括基因名称、氨基酸变化（参考氨基酸、替代氨基酸、位置）以及组合的变异体ID。
2. **functional_evidence_aim**：功能实验的目标是评估变异体是否为致病性或良性。
3. **assessment_steps**：根据ACMG流程图逐步评估每个变异体的功能证据，包括提取的相关论文信息、判断结果及理由。
4. **final_evidence_strength**：最终确定的功能证据强度，分为致病性或良性，并给出强度等级。
5. **overall_conclusion**：总结为什么给定此强度等级，引用关键发现。

这些评估基于文献中的功能数据和ACMG功能证据评估流程图。
