Recombinant α-synuclein readily assembles into filaments that share many of the morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of the filaments present in human brain.",

Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. ... Incubation of liposomes with GST bound to glutathione–agarose gave a figure for non-specific binding of approximately 12%, with the binding of wild-type GST-α-synuclein taken as 100%. Non-specific binding due to GST bound to beads was subtracted from total binding to give the specific binding of α-synuclein.",

### 解释
1. **变异体识别信息**：从文献中提取了基因名称（SNCA）、氨基酸变化（E46K）以及变体字符串ID（SNCA E46K）。
2. **功能证据评估**：
   - **疾病机制定义**：文献明确了α-synuclein突变与帕金森病及路易体痴呆的关系。
   - **实验方法适用性**：文献使用了脂质结合和丝状组装实验，这些实验能有效反映α-synuclein在疾病中的作用。
   - **基础对照和重复实验**：文献中包含了野生型和突变体对照，并描述了多次重复实验。
   - **变体对照**：文献使用了已知的致病性突变体（如A30P和A53T）作为对照。
   - **统计分析**：虽然没有直接计算OddsPath，但文献提供了详细的实验数据比较，支持中等强度的致病性证据。

最终结论是E46K突变在SNCA基因中表现出增加的磷脂结合能力和丝状组装速率，符合致病行为。实验方法和对照设计合理，支持中等强度的致病性证据。
