Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract functional evidence details from this scientific paper for each variant mentioned. The user provided a pretty detailed context, which is the abstract of a study about LRRK2 mutations causing Parkinson's disease. 

First, I need to identify all the variants mentioned in the text that have functional data. Looking at the abstract, there are two main variants discussed: dLRRK(I1915T) and hLRRK2(G2019S). These are pathogenic mutations linked to Parkinson's disease.

Next, I need to parse the variant identification information. For each variant, I should extract the gene symbol, reference amino acid, alternate amino acid, and position. From the context, both variants are in the LRRK2 gene. 

For dLRRK(I1915T), the reference amino acid is I (isoleucine) at position 1915, and it changes to T (threonine). So the protein change is I -> T at position 1915. The variant string ID would be "LRRK2 I1915T".

Similarly, for hLRRK2(G2019S), the reference amino acid is G (glycine) at position 2019, changing to S (serine). So the protein change is G -> S at position 2019. The variant string ID would be "LRRK2 G2019S".

Now, I need to apply the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart for each variant. Starting with Step 1: Define the disease mechanism. The paper clearly states that LRRK2 interacts with the miRNA pathway leading to overproduction of E2F1/DP, which contributes to pathogenesis. So the disease mechanism is defined, and the judgment here would be "Yes".

Step 2 evaluates the applicability of the assay class. The study uses in vivo EGFP reporters and co-expression assays to assess miRNA function. These methods are relevant to the disease mechanism involving miRNA impairment, so this step's judgment is also "Yes", proceeding to Step 3.

In Step 3a, I check for basic controls and replicates. The paper mentions using WT proteins as controls and performing experiments in triplicate (from Figure 1a and 2a). Since both conditions are met, we proceed to Sub-step 3c.

Sub-step 3c looks at variant controls. Known pathogenic variants (dLRRK(I1915T) and hLRRK2(G2019S)) are tested alongside WT proteins, which act as negative controls. Therefore, the judgment is "Yes", moving to Step 4.

In Step 4a, statistical analyses are evaluated. The paper provides quantitative results (e.g., increased reporter expression), but it doesn't mention specific p-values or effect sizes. So we proceed to Sub-step 4b.

Sub-step 4b considers the number of controls used. The study uses WT proteins as negative controls and pathogenic variants as positive controls, but there's no explicit count beyond these two types. Assuming at least one control per type, it might not meet the threshold for 11 or more total. However, since the paper effectively differentiates between WT and pathogenic effects, this could still be considered moderate evidence.

Finally, determining the strength of functional evidence. Since both variants show increased reporter activity correlating with toxicity, supporting their pathogenicity, each would receive a PS3_moderate rating.
