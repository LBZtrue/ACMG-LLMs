Okay, I need to help extract functional evidence details from the provided scientific paper for each variant mentioned and then assess their strength using the ACMG flowchart. Let me start by carefully reading through the abstract and introduction to identify the variants discussed.

From the abstract:
- The DJ1 gene is mentioned with mutations causing autosomal recessive EOPD (PARK7). Two mutations are described: c.192G4C (p.E64D) and another one, which I assume is L166P since it's referenced later in crystallography findings.
- Another variant, L166P, is mentioned in the context of nuclear localization changes.

So, there are two variants to assess: E64D (c.192G>C) and L166P (position likely around 166).

Next, I'll parse each variant's details:

For E64D:
- Gene: DJ1
- Protein Change: Glutamic acid (E) at position 64 to Aspartic acid (D)
- variant_string_id: DJ1 E64D

Functional evidence for E64D includes:
- Reduced DAT binding in the patient's striatum using [18F]FP-CIT and PET, indicating loss of dopaminergic afferents.
- The sister, homozygous for E64D, had reduced dopamine uptake compared to a heterozygous brother who was unaffected.

For L166P:
- Gene: DJ1
- Protein Change: Leucine (L) at position 166 to Proline (P)
- variant_string_id: DJ1 L166P

Functional evidence for L166P includes:
- Approximately 80% of cells showed predominant nuclear localization, unlike the wild-type which had homogenous staining.

Now, I need to apply the ACMG flowchart for each variant. Let's start with E64D.

**Step 1: Define the disease mechanism**
The paper states that mutations in DJ1 cause autosomal recessive EOPD, leading to early-onset Parkinson’s disease. The functional assays here are measuring dopamine uptake and protein localization. So yes, the disease mechanism is clear—loss of dopaminergic neurons leads to PD.

**Step 2: Evaluate assay applicability**
The assays used include DAT binding (measuring dopamine transport) and immunocytochemistry for protein localization. These methods assess presynaptic dopamine function and DJ1's role in protein stability or aggregation, both relevant to the disease mechanism. So, applicable.

**Step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates**
Looking at E64D:
- They compared the patient (homozygous) to his sister (also homozygous but unaffected) and a brother who was heterozygous. This includes wild-type (brother) and abnormal (patient/sister). Replicate details aren't explicitly stated, so I can’t confirm multiple replicates.

**Step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay**
Since basic controls might be insufficient, but the assays used are standard in the field— DAT binding is a common method for assessing dopamine function. So, yes, it's an accepted assay.

Thus, functional evidence strength is Max PS3_supporting.

For L166P:

**Step 1: Define disease mechanism**
Same as E64D; DJ1 mutations cause EOPD via loss of dopaminergic neurons. The mechanism is clear.

**Step 2: Evaluate assay applicability**
Immunocytochemistry for protein localization reflects the role of DJ1 in preventing neurodegeneration, possibly through proper protein folding or localization. This is relevant to the disease mechanism.

**Step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates**
They compared cells expressing L166P with wild-type DJ1. They mention that about 80% showed nuclear localization. It doesn't specify if multiple replicates were done, but they likely included controls (wild-type vs mutant).

**Step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay**
Immunocytochemistry is a standard method for protein localization studies and is widely accepted.

Thus, functional evidence strength is Max PS3_supporting.

Both variants show functional impact supporting pathogenicity. Since the functional assays are applicable and validated but lack detailed replicate information beyond basic controls, they both get PS3_supporting.
