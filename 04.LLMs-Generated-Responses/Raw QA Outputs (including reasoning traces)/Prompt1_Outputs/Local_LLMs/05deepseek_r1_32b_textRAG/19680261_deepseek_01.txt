Okay, so I'm trying to assess the functional evidence for two variants mentioned in this Parkinson's disease study involving DJ-1. The variants are D149A and L166P. 

First, looking at D149A: From the abstract, it says that the D149A mutation makes DJ-1 resistant to caspase-6 proteolysis, which means it can't be processed by this enzyme. This results in losing its protective phenotype against cell death. So, the function is impaired because the protein isn't being cleaved as usual, leading to cell death.

Now, for L166P: The paper mentions that this mutation prevents DJ-1 from forming dimers, which is important for its anti-apoptotic function. However, unlike D149A, L166P doesn't affect the proteolysis by caspase-6; it just stops DJ-1 from working properly in another way.

Using the ACMG guidelines, I need to determine if these variants are pathogenic or benign based on functional evidence. 

Starting with Step 1: The paper clearly defines that DJ-1 mutations lead to loss of function through mechanisms like impaired proteolysis or dimerization. So, yes, the disease mechanism is defined.

Step 2: The assays used here (caspase activity and protein interaction) are relevant because they model the molecular pathways affected in PD. So, yes, applicable.

Step 3a: I need to check if there were controls and replicates. The paper doesn't explicitly mention using wild-type or negative controls nor does it say anything about replicate experiments. 

Since there's no info on controls or replicates, moving to Step 3b: Have these assays been validated elsewhere? The methods used are standard in the field (caspase activity assays and protein interaction studies), so yes, they're accepted.

Therefore, for D149A and L166P, the functional evidence is at least supporting. 

Moving to Step 4a: There's no statistical analysis mentioned that would allow calculating OddsPath. So, we look at how many controls were used. The paper only discusses these two variants without comparing them to a larger set of known benign or pathogenic variants.

Since there are less than 10 total controls across the study related to this variant's assay, the strength is supporting for both PS3 and BS3.

In conclusion, D149A and L166P have functional evidence that weakens DJ-1's protective role against cell death, making them pathogenic with a supporting strength.
