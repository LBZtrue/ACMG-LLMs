Alright, I need to help this user by extracting functional evidence details from a provided scientific paper text for each variant mentioned. The variants are A53T and S87N in the α-synuclein gene.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The study compares human and mouse α-synuclein aggregation, focusing on how specific amino acid substitutions affect fibril formation and their relation to Parkinson's disease (PD).

For each variant:

1. **A53T Substitution**:
   - From the abstract: "the A53T substitution dominates the growth kinetics." This suggests that A53T significantly affects the aggregation process, which is relevant to PD pathogenesis.
   
2. **S87N Substitution**:
   - The abstract mentions that the lag phase (a part of fibril formation) is affected by both A53T and S87N substitutions. So, while S87N contributes, it's not as dominant as A53T in growth kinetics.

Now, applying the ACMG flowchart:

**Step 1: Define Disease Mechanism**
- The disease mechanism here is α-synuclein aggregation leading to PD. Both variants are linked to this process.

**Step 2: Evaluate Applicability of Assay Class**
- The assays used (fluorescence and NMR) assess protein aggregation, which directly relates to the disease mechanism. So, applicable.

**Step 3a: Basic Controls/Replicates**
- The paper mentions using a systematic series of chimeras but doesn't detail controls or replicates explicitly. Since these details aren't provided, I can't confirm if basic controls were included or multiple replicates used.

**Step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay**
- Fluorescence and NMR are standard techniques in the field, so even without explicit control details, their use is validated.

**Step 4a: Statistical Analyses**
- The study doesn't mention statistical tests or p-values. So, no OddsPath calculation here.

**Step 4b: Number of Controls**
- The paper uses a systematic series (8 chimeras), but it's unclear how many are benign/pathogenic controls. Without explicit info on control numbers, I can't determine their quantity.

Based on this:

For **A53T**, since it dominates growth kinetics and the assay is applicable with validated methods, the functional evidence strength is PS3_supporting as a pathogenic variant.

For **S87N**, while it affects the lag phase, its role isn't dominant. Since the same assay applies but without strong controls or statistical data, it's BS3_supporting as benign.
