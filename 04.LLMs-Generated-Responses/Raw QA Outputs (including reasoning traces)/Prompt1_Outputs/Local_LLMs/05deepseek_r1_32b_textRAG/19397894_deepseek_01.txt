Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at the assessment for each variant in the provided literature.

**For Variant G2019S:**
1. **Disease Mechanism:** The paper clearly states that LRRK2 mutations cause Parkinson's disease by altering kinase activity. This sets a solid foundation for understanding the relevance of their functional assays.
   
2. **Applicability of Assay:** They used kinase activity and ATP binding assays, which are directly related to the proposed mechanism. These assays effectively model how mutations affect enzyme function, making them applicable.

3. **Validity of Assays:**
   - **Controls and Replicates:** The paper doesn't explicitly mention wild-type controls or multiple replicates beyond what's standard in kinase studies.
   - Since explicit details on controls are lacking, the assay's validity isn't as strong as it could be.

4. **Evidence Strength:** Without statistical analysis of OddsPath and limited control information, the evidence is supporting for pathogenicity.

**For Variant I2020T:**
1. **Disease Mechanism:** Same as G2019S; the mechanism is clearly defined around kinase activity changes.

2. **Applicability of Assay:** Again, they used relevant assays to assess kinase activity and ATP binding, aligning with the disease model.

3. **Validity of Assays:**
   - Similar to G2019S, there's no explicit mention of controls or replicates beyond standard practices.
   
4. **Evidence Strength:** The functional data suggests increased resistance to inhibitors but lacks strong statistical backing, leading to a supporting rating for pathogenicity.

In both cases, the lack of detailed control information and statistical analysis on OddsPath limited the strength of the evidence. However, their altered kinase activities support the idea that these variants contribute to PD pathogenesis.
