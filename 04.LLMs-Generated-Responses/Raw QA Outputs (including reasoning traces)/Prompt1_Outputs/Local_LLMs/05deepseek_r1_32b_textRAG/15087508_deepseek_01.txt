Alright, I need to assess the functional evidence for each variant mentioned in the provided literature excerpt. Let's start by identifying all variants discussed.

From the context, two mutations are described in PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1), associated with PARK6:
1. A truncating nonsense mutation.
2. A missense mutation at a highly conserved amino acid.

Now, I'll extract relevant details for each variant:

**First Variant: Truncating Nonsense Mutation**
- Gene: PINK1
- Protein Change: Truncation (due to nonsense), but exact amino acids and position aren't specified.
- Since the paper refers to it as a truncating mutation affecting the kinase domain, I'll note that.

**Second Variant: Missense Mutation**
- Gene: PINK1
- Protein Change: A specific missense change at a highly conserved residue. The exact amino acids (ref and alt) and position aren't provided in the context.

Next, applying the ACMG flowchart steps:

**Step 1: Define Disease Mechanism**
The paper connects PINK1 mutations to Parkinson's disease (PD), implicating mitochondrial dysfunction as part of the pathogenesis. Both variants are linked to this mechanism through their effect on PINK1 function. So, yes.

**Step 2: Evaluate Applicability of Assays**
The functional assays involve cell culture studies showing mitochondrial localization and protective effects abrogated by mutations. These models reflect PD's mechanisms related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, applicable—proceed to Step 3.

**Step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates**
No explicit details on controls or replicates are provided in the context. So, both conditions (controls and replicates) aren't met. Proceed to Sub-step 3b.

**Step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay**
The study uses standard cell culture techniques which are broadly accepted in the field. Thus, it meets condition a). Functional evidence strength becomes Max PS3_supporting.

**Step 4a: Statistical Analyses**
No stats or OddsPath mentioned. Proceed to Sub-step 4b.

**Sub-step 4b: Number of Controls**
No controls are explicitly listed for these assays. Since there's insufficient info, the strength remains Max PS3_supporting.

Assigning final strengths:
Both variants lack specific details on controls and statistical analyses but use accepted assays in relevant models. Hence, both receive a functional evidence strength of PS3_supporting.

Finally, compiling all this into JSON as per instructions.
