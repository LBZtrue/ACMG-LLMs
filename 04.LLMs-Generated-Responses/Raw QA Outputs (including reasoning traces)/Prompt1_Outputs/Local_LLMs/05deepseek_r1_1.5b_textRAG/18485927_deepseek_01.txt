Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract functional evidence for each variant mentioned in this scientific paper using the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart. Let's start by breaking down what the user needs.

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. It seems like there are several variants listed with their gene names and protein changes. Each variant has a specific ID and string that includes the gene symbol, its position in the amino acid sequence, and possibly an alternate coding version (alt). For each variant, I have to apply the flowchart steps outlined by ACMG.

Starting with the first variant: "EGFR". The protein change here is -L238R. This means there's a mutation where EGF receptor EGFR has changed its amino acid at position 238 from L (Leu) to R (Res). Now, I need to assess whether this mutation provides functional evidence.

Looking at the flowchart steps:
1. **Step 1: Define the disease mechanism** – The paper doesn't explicitly state what defines the EGF receptor disease. It focuses on ubiquitin ligase activity and beta strands. So, this variant might not have a clear disease mechanism defined here.
2. **Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field** – The paper uses enzymes (like ubiquitin ligase) to measure activity, which are common methods for pathogenicity assays. But since step 1 didn't define the mechanism clearly, we might not apply PS3 or BS3 here.
3. **Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays** – Since it's an enzyme assay and doesn't meet the basic controls/replicates criteria (no wild-type mentioned), it doesn't qualify for PS3 or BS3 evidence.

Based on this, "EGFR" likely has no strong functional evidence because the mechanism isn't clearly defined, and the assay doesn't have enough basic controls. So, it's probably benign but not pathogenic.

Moving to the second variant: "CFTR". The protein change is -H117R. This mutation changes cysteine (Cys) at position 117 of CFTR into arginine (Arg). Again, looking at the flowchart:
1. **Step 1**: No clear disease mechanism defined.
2. **Step 2**: Enzyme assays are used but without specific controls.
3. **Step 3**: Not meeting basic controls, so no evidence.

Thus, "CFTR" also lacks sufficient functional evidence and is likely benign.

For the third variant: "ARJ1". The protein change here is -S74L. Adenine (Aden) at position 74 in ARJ1 changes to leucine (Leu). Applying the flowchart:
1. **Step 1**: No clear disease mechanism.
2. **Step 2**: Enzyme assays used but without specific controls.
3. **Step 3**: Not meeting basic controls, so no evidence.

So, "ARJ1" also doesn't have functional evidence and is benign.

The fourth variant: "LHN2". The protein change is -H80E. Histidine (His) at position 80 changes to glutamic acid (Gln). Flowchart steps:
1. **Step 1**: No clear mechanism defined.
2. **Step 2**: Enzyme assays used but without controls.
3. **Step 3**: Not meeting basic controls.

Therefore, "LHN2" lacks functional evidence and is benign.

Finally, the fifth variant: "SRB1". The protein change here is -K78S. Metine (Met) at position 78 changes to serine (Ser). Applying the flowchart:
1. **Step 1**: No clear mechanism defined.
2. **Step 2**: Enzyme assays used but without controls.
3. **Step 3**: Not meeting basic controls.

So, "SRB1" also lacks functional evidence and is benign.

In summary, all these variants in the paper lack sufficient functional evidence to classify them as pathogenic. They are likely benign based on the information provided.
