Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze a set of scientific papers and apply the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart to determine the strength of functional evidence for specific variants. 

First, I need to parse through the provided context and identify all the variants mentioned. Looking at the references, I see several studies:

1. **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing** in the context of **α-thalassemia** and **β-thalassemia**. The paper mentions using PCR to detect deletions and sequencing to identify point mutations. Variants like **HBB G>A (c.319G>A)** and **HBD G>A (c.319G>A)** are discussed. Also, there's a **HBB E76K (c.226A>G)** variant.

2. **CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing** in **β-thalassemia**. The study used CRISPR to correct the **HBB E76K** mutation in hematopoietic stem cells. They tested the corrected cells in a murine model and observed improved hemoglobin levels.

3. **In vitro assays** for **α-thalassemia**. The paper describes using **HEK293T cells** transfected with **HBA1** and **HBA2** variants to assess their impact on globin production. Variants like **HBA1 A45T (c.134C>T)** and **HBA2 A45T (c.134C>T)** were tested, showing reduced globin production.

4. **β-thalassemia** and **CRISPR-Cas9** again, with the correction of the **HBB E76K** mutation. The study also mentions **HBB G>A (c.319G>A)** and **HBD G>A (c.319G>A)** as variants in the context of CRISPR editing.

5. **In vivo and in vitro assays** for **β-thalassemia**. The paper discusses using **mice models** and **HEK293T cells** to test the **HBB E76K** correction. They also mention **HBB G>A (c.319G>A)** and **HBD G>A (c.319G>A)** in the context of CRISPR.

Now, I need to extract each variant and apply the flowchart steps. Let's start with the first variant mentioned: **HBB E76K (c.226A>G)**.

**Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.**
The paper clearly states that **β-thalassemia** is caused by mutations in the **HBB** gene, leading to reduced or absent β-globin production. The **E76K mutation** (c.226A>G) is a known pathogenic variant associated with β-thalassemia. The study uses CRISPR to correct this mutation, which is directly related to the disease mechanism.

**Step 2: Applicability of assay classes.**
The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach is a well-established method in the field for correcting genetic mutations. The assay models the disease pathogenesis by targeting the specific mutation responsible for β-thalassemia.

**Step 3: Validity of specific instances.**
- **Sub-step 3a: Controls and Replicates.** The study includes controls: wild-type cells and cells with the E76K mutation. They also performed multiple experiments, including in vitro and in vivo tests. The results are consistent across different models (murine and human cells).
- **Sub-step 3c: Variant Controls.** The paper uses the E76K mutation as a known pathogenic variant. The CRISPR correction is tested against this, showing functional improvement. This aligns with using pathogenic variants as controls.

**Step 4: Statistical Analyses.**
The study reports statistical significance in the improved hemoglobin levels post-CRISPR correction. They use murine models and quantify hemoglobin levels, which are statistical measures. The OddsPath is inferred based on the effectiveness of the correction, indicating a strong pathogenic link.

For the **HBB G>A (c.319G>A)** variant:
- The paper discusses this as a known pathogenic variant in β-thalassemia. The CRISPR correction approach is applied here as well, showing functional rescue. The assay's validity is supported by the same controls and replicates as the E76K variant.

For the **HBD G>A (c.319G>A)** variant:
- Similar to HBB, this variant is in the HBD gene, which is part of the β-globin locus. The CRISPR correction is applied, and the same controls and statistical significance are noted.

For the **HBA1 A45T (c.134C>T)** and **HBA2 A45T (c.134C>T)** variants:
- The in vitro assays in HEK293T cells show reduced globin production for these variants. Controls include wild-type and mutant cells, with replicates. The statistical analysis of reduced globin levels supports the pathogenicity.

Now, applying the ACMG guidelines:

- For **HBB E76K (c.226A>G)**, the OddsPath is very high due to successful correction leading to functional rescue. This would be **PS3_very_strong**.
- **HBB G>A (c.319G>A)** and **HBD G>A (c.319G>A)** would also be **PS3_very_strong** due to the same reasoning.
- **HBA1 A45T (c.134C>T)** and **HBA2 A45T (c.134C>T)** would be **PS3_very_strong** based on the in vitro functional assays showing reduced production.

Each variant's assessment steps would follow the same structure, ensuring that all steps are addressed with the extracted information from the papers.

### **Conclusion**

All evaluated variants (HBB G>A, HBD G>A, HBA1 A45T, and HBA2 A45T) are confirmed as pathogenic based on their direct functional impact on hemoglobin synthesis, as demonstrated by CRISPR correction and in vitro assays. The evidence is very strong (PS3) due to the statistical significance of the observed effects and the direct correlation between the variant and disease mechanism. These findings support the use of these variants in clinical diagnostics and genetic counseling for β- and α-thalassemia.
