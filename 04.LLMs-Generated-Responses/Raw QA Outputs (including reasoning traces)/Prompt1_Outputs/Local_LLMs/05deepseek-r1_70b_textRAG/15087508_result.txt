Okay, so I need to extract relevant functional evidence details from the provided scientific text for each variant mentioned. First, I'll look through the context to identify any gene variants. I see mentions of PINK1 and a specific mutation, G309D. There's also a reference to wild-type PINK1 and vector controls. 

Next, I'll parse the variant identification information. The gene here is PINK1, and the protein change is from G (glycine) to D (aspartic acid) at position 309. So, the variant_string_id would be PINK1 G309D.

Now, applying the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart. Starting with Step 1: Define the disease mechanism. The paper discusses apoptosis and TMRM fluorescence, which relates to mitochondrial function, a known role of PINK1. So, the disease mechanism is defined.

Step 2: Evaluate the assay's applicability. The assays used are FACS for apoptosis and TMRM fluorescence, which are standard in studying mitochondrial function and cell death, relevant to PINK1's role.

Moving to Step 3: Evaluate validity of assays. The text mentions experiments were done in duplicate or triplicate and across three independent experiments, so basic controls and replicates are present. This means we proceed to Sub-step 3c about variant controls. However, the context doesn't mention specific known pathogenic or benign variants used as controls, so we don't have variant controls.

Since variant controls aren't mentioned, we can't proceed further in Step 3. Therefore, the functional evidence strength is PS3_supporting because the assays are valid but without variant controls, it's not as strong.

For Step 4, since we didn't get to Sub-step 3c, we don't have statistical analyses or OddsPath calculations. Without these, we can't assign higher strengths like moderate or very strong. Thus, the final strength remains PS3_supporting.

The overall conclusion is that while the functional assays are relevant and well-controlled, the absence of specific variant controls means the evidence strength is supporting rather than moderate or very strong.
