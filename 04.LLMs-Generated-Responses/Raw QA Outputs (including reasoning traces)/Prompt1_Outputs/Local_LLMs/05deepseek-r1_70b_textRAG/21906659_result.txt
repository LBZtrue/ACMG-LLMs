Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a scientific text that includes several experiments assessing the functional impact of two α-synuclein variants: α-syn(WT) and α-syn(A30P). My task is to extract relevant functional evidence details for each variant, parse variant information, apply the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart, determine the strength of the evidence, and output the results in a specific JSON format.

First, I'll extract the relevant details from the provided text. The text mentions two variants: α-syn(WT) and α-syn(A30P). For each variant, there are functional assays assessing cell viability under different conditions.

Starting with α-syn(WT):
- The experiment involves PC12/TetOn cells expressing α-syn(WT). The cell viability is assessed using an assay described in part (A). The results show that cell viability is significantly reduced under certain conditions, with p-values indicating statistical significance (P<0.05; P<0.01). This suggests that the wild-type protein may have a pathogenic effect under these conditions.

Next, for α-syn(A30P):
- Similar experiments are conducted with PC12/TetOn cells expressing α-syn(A30P). The cell viability assay shows significant effects as well, with p-values indicating statistical significance (P<0.05). This suggests that the A30P variant may also impact cell viability, potentially indicating a pathogenic role.

Now, I'll parse the variant identification information. The gene is SNCA (the gene encoding α-synuclein). The protein changes are from the reference (wild-type) to the alternate for each variant. For α-syn(WT), there's no amino acid change, but since it's the wild-type, I'll denote the position as 0 or "WT". For α-syn(A30P), the reference is Alanine (A) at position 30, changing to Proline (P).

Next, I'll apply the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart for each variant.

Starting with Step 1: Define the disease mechanism. The paper likely investigates the role of α-synuclein in neurodegeneration, possibly in the context of Parkinson's disease, given the common association of α-synuclein with this condition. Therefore, the disease mechanism is related to protein aggregation and toxicity.

For Step 2: Evaluate the assay type. The assays used are cell viability assays, which are standard in the field to assess the pathogenic effects of protein variants. Since cell viability directly relates to the disease mechanism (neurodegeneration leading to cell death), the assays are applicable. Thus, we proceed to Step 3.

Step 3 involves evaluating the validity of the assays. Sub-step 3a checks for controls and replicates. The text mentions three replicates for each condition and uses statistical tests (one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test). This indicates that both controls and replicates are present, so we proceed to Sub-step 3c.

Sub-step 3c assesses variant controls. The experiments include both wild-type and mutant (A30P) variants, which can serve as controls for each other. However, it's unclear if known pathogenic or benign variants were explicitly used as controls. Since the text doesn't specify, I'll infer that variant controls are present based on the comparison between WT and A30P.

Moving to Step 4: Applying evidence to individual variants. Sub-step 4a evaluates statistical analyses. The text provides p-values and mentions one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test, indicating robust statistical methods. However, there's no direct mention of OddsPath calculation, so we proceed to Sub-step 4b.

Sub-step 4b counts the number of control variants. The study includes at least two variants (WT and A30P), but it's unclear if more were used. Assuming only these two, the total is less than 10, so the evidence strength is supporting.

For both variants, the functional evidence aims to show pathogenicity, given the context of assessing cell viability reduction. The statistical significance and experimental design support a pathogenic role, leading to a PS3_supporting strength.

Finally, I'll structure the findings into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are populated accurately.
