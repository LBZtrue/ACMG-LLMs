Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and dementia with Lewy bodies, are associated with the aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn). αSyn is the major protein component found in the Lewy bodies of patients with PD and that the protein exists as amyloid like fibrils.",
