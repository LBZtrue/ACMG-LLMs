Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract functional evidence details from the provided abstract about PINK1 mutations. There are two variants mentioned: p.A244G and p.V317I. 

First, I need to parse each variant's information. The abstract says both mutations "abolish the protective effect of wild-type PINK1 against staurosporine-induced apoptosis." So the functional evidence here is that these variants disrupt the protective function of PINK1. 

For the variant identification, the Gene is PINK1. The protein changes are A244G and V317I. The positions are 244 and 317. The variant strings would be PINK1 A244G and PINK1 V317I.

Next, applying the ACMG flowchart. Step 1: Define the disease mechanism. The paper mentions that PINK1 mutations cause parkinsonism, and the mechanism involves protection against apoptosis. The abstract states that the mutations abolish this protective effect, so the disease mechanism is clear. So Step 1 judgment is Yes.

Step 2: Evaluate the assay's applicability. The assay here is testing the protective effect against apoptosis. The disease mechanism involves apoptosis, so the assay is relevant. So Step 2 judgment is Yes, proceed to Step 3.

Step 3a: Check for controls and replicates. The abstract doesn't mention specific controls like wild-type or known mutants, nor does it talk about replicates. So the answer here is No, moving to Step 3b.

Step 3b: Check if the assay is accepted or validated. The abstract doesn't mention prior validation or commercial kits. So the answer is No, leading to "Do not use PS3/BS3." But wait, the user's instruction says to apply the flowchart. However, the paper does mention that both mutations abolished the protective effect, which is a functional assay. But since the controls and replicates aren't mentioned, maybe the evidence is considered supporting.

But according to the flowchart, if Step 3a isn't met (no controls/replicates), we go to 3b. If the assay isn't validated, then we can't use PS3/BS3. However, the paper does describe an assay, even if controls aren't mentioned. The question is whether the assay is considered valid. Since the paper is a published study, maybe it's considered accepted. But the user's instructions require explicit mentions. The abstract doesn't state that the assay is standard or validated, so maybe 3b is not met. Thus, the evidence strength would be "Do not use PS3/BS3."

But the user's example in the flowchart says that if 3a is no, then go to 3b. If 3b is no, then do not use. But the user's answer might consider that the assay is valid even without controls. However, according to the strict instructions, the paper must mention controls. Since it doesn't, the answer would be that the evidence isn't applicable. But the user might expect that the functional evidence is considered supporting because the study shows the effect. 

This is a bit conflicting. The abstract states that both mutations "were found to abolish the protective effect," which is a functional assay. However, without controls, the evidence strength might be considered supporting. But according to the flowchart, if controls aren't mentioned, then we can't assign PS3/BS3. But the user might have a different take. 

Alternatively, maybe the assay is considered valid because it's a standard apoptosis assay. But the paper doesn't mention that. So perhaps the answer is that the evidence is not applicable. But the user's example in the output requires a strength. 

This is tricky. The answer might need to state that the evidence is not applicable, but the user's instructions require a strength. However, the user's example in the flowchart says that if the assay isn't validated, then do not use PS3/BS3. So for both variants, the final evidence strength would be N/A. But the user's question says to apply the flowchart. 

Alternatively, maybe the functional evidence is considered supporting because the study shows the effect. But according to the flowchart, without controls, it's not valid. So the final answer would have "Do not use PS3/BS3" for both variants. However, the user's example might expect PS3_supporting. 

I need to follow the instructions strictly. Since the paper doesn't mention controls or replicates, and no prior validation, the answer would be that the evidence is not applicable. But the user's output requires a strength. Maybe the answer is that the evidence is not applicable, so strength is N/A. But the user's example might have different expectations. 

In conclusion, based on the given text, the functional evidence for both variants is considered as "Do not use PS3/BS3" because the necessary controls and validations aren't mentioned. However, the user might expect that the functional evidence is supporting. But according to the strict flowchart, without controls, it's not applicable. So the final answer would have "Do not use PS3/BS3" for both variants.
