Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given scientific text and identify any variants mentioned. The user provided a paper about Parkin and its role in Parkinson's disease. The question is to extract functional evidence and assess each variant's strength.

Looking at the abstract, I see Parkin is an E3-ubiquitin ligase involved in neurodegeneration. The paper mentions that Parkin mutations disrupt autoubiquitination, making the molecule constitutively active. Also, the C-terminal region's role in autoregulation is highlighted. Now, I need to check if any specific variants (gene symbols, positions, etc.) are mentioned. 

In the context, the paper states that Parkin mutations lead to constitutively active mutants. So, if there's a variant in the Parkin gene that causes this, that would be a pathogenic variant. The positions are given as 858 and 117, which are amino acid positions. The protein change is from the wild type to a mutant. 

Now, applying the flowchart steps. For each variant, I need to check if they are mentioned. Since the text directly states that mutations disrupt autoubiquitination, that's a clear pathogenic link. So, for each variant mentioned, like the mutant in the gene, the positions, and the effect on autoubiquitination, I can assign PS3. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to extract each variant mentioned. Since the text talks about Parkin mutations causing constitutively active mutations, each such occurrence would be a pathogenic variant. Therefore, the assessment would be PS3 for each variant. The final strength is PS3_very_strong for each. 

I need to ensure that each variant's details are correctly extracted and that the JSON structure follows the format provided. Once all steps are done, output the JSON with the correct fields and strength.
