Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract functional evidence details for each variant mentioned and assess their strength. First, I need to go through the provided text and identify any mentions of specific gene or protein variants.

Looking at the abstract, there's mention of a-synuclein mutations in PD. The paper talks about normal and mutant a-synuclein in neuroblastoma cell lines. They also mention altered expression of dihydropteridine reductase, which regulates dopamine synthesis. For dopamine synthesis, they downregulate GTP cyclohydrolase, sepiapterin reductase (SR), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and aromatic acid decarboxylase (AAD). They also found reduced expression of Nurr1, which is a transcription factor involved in dopamine synthesis.

Now, I need to parse each variant. The text mentions "wild-type but not mutant a-synuclein" and "reduced expression of Nurr1". Wait, but in the paper, the wild-type a-synuclein doesn't show mutation, so maybe there's a mutation. Wait, the user's instruction says to extract variants mentioned, so if there are no mutations, maybe the answer is that there are no variants. But the user's example has variants like EGFR and CFTR, so maybe in this case, since the a-synuclein is the main topic, but no mutations are mentioned, the answer would list that there are no variants. But the user's example uses EGFR and CFTR, so perhaps the answer is that there are no variants. Let me check again.

The text says "wild-type but not mutant a-synuclein" and "reduced expression of Nurr1". But since they are wild-type, maybe the presence of wild-type and not mutant means no mutations. So there are no functional evidence in terms of variants. Therefore, the answer would state that there are no variants found, and their assessment is based on the absence of mutations. Then, the steps would be to extract the absence, apply the flowchart, and assign based on no variants. Finally, the strength is N/A, and the conclusion is that there are no functional evidence.
