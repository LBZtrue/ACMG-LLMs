functional_evidence_assessment: [ ... ]
```

**Note:**
* If multiple variants are being assessed, all should be included in a single array under `functional_evidence_assessment`.
* Ensure that all ACMG criteria (PS3, BS3) and strength levels (very_strong, moderate, supporting) are correctly applied based on the flowchart logic.
* If any step or sub-step does not apply to a particular variant, it should be omitted from the array for that variant.
* All extracted information must come directly from the provided text.

**Given the complexity of the task, I am providing a simplified example (which does not match the current input) for illustrative purposes:**
