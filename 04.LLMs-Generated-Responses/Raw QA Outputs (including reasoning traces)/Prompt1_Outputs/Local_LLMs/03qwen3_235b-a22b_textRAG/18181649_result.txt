```Based on the provided text, I have created a JSON object with the functional evidence assessment for the DJ-1 variants M26I, A104T, and E163K. The assessment follows the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart and provides the strength of the evidence for each variant.

Each variant is assessed based on the following steps:

1. **Define the disease mechanism**: The paper states that DJ-1's pathogenic variants are studied to understand their impact on the protein's protective function, implying the disease mechanism related to DJ-1 dysfunction. This step was judged as "Yes" for all variants.

2. **Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field**: The paper uses thermal stability assays (differential scanning calorimetry) to assess the impact of mutations on DJ-1, which is relevant for understanding how these mutations might contribute to disease by destabilizing the protein. This step was judged as "Yes" for all variants, and the assessment proceeds to Step 3.

3. **Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays**: The data analysis included various models and assessed fit quality by examining residuals, indicating appropriate controls were used. This step was judged as "Yes" for all variants, and the assessment proceeds to Sub-step 3c.

4. **Variant Controls**: The paper does not explicitly mention using known pathogenic or benign variants as controls. This step was judged as "No" for all variants, and the assessment proceeds to Step 4.

5. **Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation**: The paper does not provide statistical analyses or OddsPath calculations for any of the variants. This step was judged as "No" for all variants, and the assessment proceeds to Sub-step 4b.

6. **No OddsPath Calculation**: The paper does not provide information on the total number of benign/pathogenic variant controls used. This step was judged as "No" for all variants, and the functional evidence strength is determined to be Max PS3_supporting for all variants.

The final evidence strength for all three variants (M26I, A104T, and E163K) is PS3_supporting, as they show reduced thermal stability compared to the wild-type but lack detailed statistical analysis and control variant information.
