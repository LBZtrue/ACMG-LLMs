Answer:

None of the variants in the provided text have been assigned a PS3_very_strong evidence strength. Both variants (R42P and R275W in Parkin) were assigned PS3_moderate strength.

To make a PS3_very_strong assignment, we would need to see explicit OddsPath calculations with values exceeding 18.7, which were not reported in the provided text.

The assessment for both variants followed the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart and reached Step 4b, where the decision was made based on the number of pathogenic variant controls used (more than 10), leading to a PS3_moderate strength assignment.

Without additional information or explicit OddsPath calculations with very high values, we cannot assign PS3_very_strong strength to any variant in this dataset.
