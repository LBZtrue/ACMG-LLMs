I cannot extract the necessary functional evidence details for each variant because the provided text does not contain explicit information about specific gene variants, their functional data, or experimental results that would allow me to populate the required JSON structure according to the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart.

The text fragment appears to be from a paper discussing LRRK2 mutations and their analysis, but it doesn't provide complete information about specific variants, their experimental characterization, or quantitative functional data needed for this assessment. The text is incomplete and lacks the specific details about individual variants that would be required to perform this analysis.

I would need access to the complete text of the paper, particularly Supplementary Table S1 which is mentioned but not provided, to extract the necessary variant-specific functional evidence for assessment.
