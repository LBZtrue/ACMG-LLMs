 results presented here fully agree with the earlier conclusions that on average the lipid binding propensity of the 100 N-terminal residues is higher than for the C-terminal tail, with little impact from the disease mutations. However, when analyzing the data in the site-specific manner employed in this study, we see considerable differences. For 

ng modes of RS is affected by each of the three known disease mutations. The higher, comparable, and lower total lipid affinities of E46K, A53T, and A30P RS variants have, to this point, been difficult to understand with respect to PD etiology.

 the three known disease mutations. The higher, comparable, and lower total lipid affinities of E46K, A53T, and A30P RS variants have, to this point, been difficult to understand with respect to PD etiology. This paradox, however, appears to be largely resolved when considering the relative ratios of the different lipid binding modes of RS.

Based on the provided text, I can identify three variants:
1. E46K
2. A53T
3. A30P

All three are disease mutations affecting lipid binding properties of the RS protein (presumably α-synuclein, though not explicitly stated).

Let me analyze each variant according to the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart:
