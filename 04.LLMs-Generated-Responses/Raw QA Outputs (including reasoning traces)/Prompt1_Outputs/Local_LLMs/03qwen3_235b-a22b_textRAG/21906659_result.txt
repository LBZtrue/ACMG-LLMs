Based on the provided literature content, the only gene variant mentioned with functional data is **SNCA p.A30P** (␣-syn(A30P)). The text also references ␣-syn(WT) as the wild-type control.

### Variant Identification Information

- **Gene**: SNCA (Alpha-synuclein)
- **Protein Change**: A30P
- **Reference Amino Acid (ref)**: Alanine (A)
- **Alternate Amino Acid (alt)**: Proline (P)
- **Position**: 30
- **variant_string_id**: SNCA A30P

### Functional Evidence Aim

The functional assays aim to assess pathogenicity by measuring cell viability in PC12/TetOn cells expressing the variant under doxycycline stimulation. The comparison to wild-type and the presence of statistical analyses (ANOVA with post-hoc test) indicate a focus on pathogenic effects.

### Step-by-Step Assessment

#### Step 1: Define the disease mechanism

- **Extracted Paper Info**: The assays measure cell viability in PC12/TetOn cells expressing ␣-syn(A30P) and ␣-syn(WT) under doxycycline stimulation. The implication is that the A30P variant affects alpha-synuclein function, leading to cellular dysfunction relevant to Parkinson's disease.
- **Judgment**: Yes
- **Reasoning**: The disease mechanism is inferred through the context of alpha-synuclein dysfunction leading to cell viability changes, a known mechanism in Parkinson's disease.

#### Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field

- **Extracted Paper Info**: The assays involve cell viability measurements in a model system (PC12/TetOn cells) with doxycycline-induced expression of the variant and wild-type protein.
- **Judgment**: Yes
- **Reasoning**: Cell viability assays in neuronal cell models are standard in the field for assessing the effects of alpha-synuclein variants on cellular health.
- **Next Step**: Proceed to Step 3

#### Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays

##### Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates

- **Extracted Paper Info**: The experimental scheme is described as being the same as in (A), and the text states "three replicates for each condition." Wild-type (␣-syn(WT)) is used as a control.
- **Judgment**: Yes
- **Reasoning**: Both wild-type (negative control) and variant (␣-syn(A30P)) are used, and the text explicitly states that three replicates were performed.

##### Sub-step 3c: Variant Controls

- **Extracted Paper Info**: The wild-type protein (␣-syn(WT)) is used as a control for the A30P variant. However, no other known pathogenic or benign variants are mentioned as controls.
- **Judgment**: No
- **Reasoning**: Only the wild-type protein is used as a control; no other pathogenic or benign variants are referenced.

#### Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation

##### Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses

- **Extracted Paper Info**: The text reports statistical significance using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test (P < 0.05; **P < 0.01).
- **Judgment**: Yes
- **Reasoning**: The use of ANOVA and post-hoc tests provides a statistical basis for interpreting the functional data.

##### Sub-step 4c: Correlate OddsPath

- **Extracted Paper Info**: No direct OddsPath value is provided in the text. However, the statistical significance (P < 0.01) suggests a strong effect size.
- **Judgment**: Inferred OddsPath > 4.3 based on statistical significance.
- **Reasoning**: The significant p-value (P < 0.01) and the comparison to wild-type suggest a moderate to strong OddsPath.

---

### Final Evidence Strength and Conclusion

- **Final Evidence Strength**: PS3_moderate
- **Reasoning**: The assays include appropriate controls and replicates, use a relevant model system, and show statistical significance. However, no additional pathogenic or benign variant controls were used, and no direct OddsPath was calculated. The inferred OddsPath based on statistical significance supports a moderate strength.

- **Overall Conclusion**: The functional evidence for SNCA p.A30P shows a statistically significant reduction in cell viability compared to wild-type, suggesting a pathogenic effect. The evidence supports PS3_moderate strength.
