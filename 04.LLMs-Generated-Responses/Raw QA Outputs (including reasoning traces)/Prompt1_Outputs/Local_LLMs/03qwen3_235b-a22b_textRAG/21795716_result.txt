What I want you to do is to read through the paper text provided and extract the relevant information to populate the JSON structure described above. If no variants are present in the text with functional data, return an empty array as shown in the example.

The input is the provided text, and the output is the JSON object as specified. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting outside of the JSON structure.
