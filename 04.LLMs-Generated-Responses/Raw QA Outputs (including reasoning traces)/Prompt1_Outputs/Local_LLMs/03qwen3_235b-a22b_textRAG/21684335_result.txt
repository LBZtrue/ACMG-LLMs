Based on the provided text, I will analyze the functional evidence for each α-synuclein (αS) variant mentioned in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

Let me extract and structure the information according to the requested JSON format:

This JSON structure follows the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart and provides assessments for each of the SNCA variants mentioned in the text:
1. SNCA A53T
2. SNCA A30P
3. SNCA E46K
4. SNCA A30P/A53T (double variant)

For all variants, the evidence strength is PS3_supporting because the paper mentions the type of assay used (in vitro fibrillization assays or M assays) but doesn't provide details on controls or replicates. These assays are standard techniques in the field, so they qualify for PS3_supporting evidence according to the ACMG guidelines.
