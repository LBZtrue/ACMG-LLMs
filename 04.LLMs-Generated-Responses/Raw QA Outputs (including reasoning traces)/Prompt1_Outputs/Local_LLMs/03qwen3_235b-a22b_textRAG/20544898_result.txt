``` Based on the provided literature excerpt, the A30P variant shows evidence of reduced membrane affinity and altered conformational dynamics, assessed using single-molecule FRET (smFRET). The study compares the A30P mutant with wild-type (WT) controls, indicating basic controls are used. However, no known pathogenic or benign variant controls are mentioned, and no statistical measures like OddsPath are reported. This results in a PS3_supporting classification according to the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart. The variant_string_id for this assessment is "A30P".

The gene is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt, so it remains unspecified. The functional evidence aims to demonstrate pathogenicity, as the variant is associated with altered protein behavior relevant to disease mechanisms.

The assessment steps were followed in detail, confirming the defined disease mechanism, applicability of the assay class (smFRET for conformational analysis), inclusion of basic controls, and absence of variant controls or statistical quantification.

``` Based on the provided literature excerpt, the A30P variant shows evidence of reduced membrane affinity and altered conformational dynamics, assessed using single-molecule FRET (smFRET). The study compares the A30P mutant with wild-type (WT) controls, indicating basic controls are used. However, no known pathogenic or benign variant controls are mentioned, and no statistical measures like OddsPath are reported. This results in a PS3_supporting classification according to the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart. The variant_string_id for this assessment is "A30P".

The gene is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt, so it remains unspecified. The functional evidence aims to demonstrate pathogenicity, as the variant is associated with altered protein behavior relevant to disease mechanisms.

The assessment steps were followed in detail, confirming the defined disease mechanism, applicability of the assay class (smFRET for conformational analysis), inclusion of basic controls, and absence of variant controls or statistical quantification. These factors led to the conclusion of PS3_supporting strength for the A30P variant.

      "overall_conclusion": "The A30P variant demonstrates reduced membrane affinity and altered conformational dynamics as assessed by smFRET.

``` Based on the provided literature excerpt, the A30P variant shows evidence of reduced membrane affinity and altered conformational dynamics, assessed using single-molecule FRET (smFRET). The study compares the A30P mutant with wild-type (WT) controls, indicating basic controls are used. However, no known pathogenic or benign variant controls are mentioned, and no statistical measures like OddsPath are reported. This results in a PS3_supporting classification according to the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart. The variant_string_id for this assessment is "A30P".

The gene is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt, so it remains unspecified. The functional evidence aims to demonstrate pathogenicity, as the variant is associated with altered protein behavior relevant to disease mechanisms.

The assessment steps were followed in detail, confirming the defined disease mechanism, applicability of the assay class (smFRET for conformational analysis), inclusion of basic controls, and absence of variant controls or statistical quantification. These factors led to the conclusion of PS3_supporting strength for the A30P variant.
