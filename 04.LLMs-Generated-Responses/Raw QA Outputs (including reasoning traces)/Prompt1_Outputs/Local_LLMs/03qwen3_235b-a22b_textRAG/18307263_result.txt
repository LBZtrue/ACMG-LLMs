Based on the provided text, the following information can be extracted and evaluated:

1. Two variants are mentioned: c.731C>G and c.949G>A in the PINK1 gene.
2. These correspond to p.A244 and p.V317 residues, respectively.
3. The paper reports compound heterozygous PINK1 mutations in a sporadic patient with typical late-onset PD.
4. Functional in vitro assays were used to provide evidence of their pathogenic potential.

Let's apply the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart to each variant:

For both variants:
- The disease mechanism is defined (PINK1 mutations causing Parkinson's disease)
- The general class of assay (Western Blotting and TUNEL assay) is applicable to the disease mechanism

For variant c.731C>G (p.A244G):
- Protein change: A (reference) > G (alternate) at position 244
- Gene: PINK1
- variant_string_id: PINK1 A244G

For variant c.949G>A (p.V317I):
- Protein change: V (reference) > I (alternate) at position 317
- Gene: PINK1
- variant_string_id: PINK1 V317I

Based on the limited information in the provided text, I'll evaluate both variants following the ACMG guidelines:
