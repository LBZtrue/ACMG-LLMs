} Based on the provided text, I've analyzed the functional evidence for both PINK1 and Parkin variants. The text demonstrates that wild-type PINK1 interacts with wild-type Parkin in co-immunoprecipitation assays, and that pathogenic Parkin mutations maintain this binding efficiency. The study was limited in that it didn't provide detailed statistical analyses or clearly specify the number of pathogenic Parkin mutations tested. The assays used were standard protein interaction techniques that are applicable to studying mitophagy in Parkinson's disease, with appropriate controls and replication. Based on these findings, both variants received a PS3_supporting classification according to ACMG guidelines.

However, I notice some ambiguity in the original text regarding specific protein changes. The text refers to "wild-type" proteins and "pathogenic parkin mutations" without specifying exact amino acid changes. If more detailed information were available about specific variants, the analysis could be more precise. For example, if the text had stated "parkin R275W mutation" or "PINK1 G309D mutation" instead of just referring to "pathogenic parkin mutations," the analysis would be more accurate. Based on the information provided, I've used general descriptors for the variants.

} Based on the provided text, I've analyzed the functional evidence for both PINK1 and Parkin variants. The text demonstrates that wild-type PINK1 interacts with wild-type Parkin in co-immunoprecipitation assays, and that pathogenic Parkin mutations maintain this binding efficiency. The study was limited in that it didn't provide detailed statistical analyses or clearly specify the number of pathogenic Parkin mutations tested. The assays used were standard protein interaction techniques that are applicable to studying mitophagy in Parkinson's disease, with appropriate controls and replication. Based on these findings, both variants received a PS3_supporting classification according to ACMG guidelines.

However, I notice some ambiguity in the original text regarding specific protein changes. The text refers to "wild-type" proteins and "pathogenic parkin mutations" without specifying exact amino acid changes. If more detailed information were available about specific variants, the analysis could be more precise. For example, if the text had stated "parkin R275W mutation" or "PINK1 G309D mutation" instead of just referring to "pathogenic parkin mutations," the analysis would be more accurate.

The text indicates that pathogenic Parkin mutations do not affect binding efficiency with PINK1, suggesting that these mutations may affect other functional aspects of Parkin that are not related to its interaction with PINK1. More research is needed to fully understand the pathophysiological effects of these mutations. parkin Wt efficiently binds to PINK1 Wt, and pathogenic parkin mutations maintain this binding efficiency, indicating that the interaction between PINK1 and Parkin is preserved in these pathogenic variants. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of these Parkin mutations may be through mechanisms other than disruption of PINK1-Parkin interaction.

The paper also notes that more work is needed to unravel the pathophysiological effects of mutant PINK1 and Parkin on mitochondria in human neurons, indicating that the current understanding is incomplete.

Therefore, the available evidence supports the conclusion that the functional interaction between PINK1 and Parkin is preserved in these pathogenic Parkin variants, but the pathogenic effects of these mutations may be through other mechanisms. Based on the ACMG guidelines, the strength of the functional evidence for these variants is PS3_supporting.
