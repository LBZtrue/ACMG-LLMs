Assistant: I'll analyze the provided text to extract functional evidence details for gene variants according to the ACMG guidelines.

Looking at the text, I can identify one specific variant:
- SNCA gene with c.157G>A base change (formerly reported as G209A)

Based on the text, this variant was analyzed using PCR and restriction enzyme digestion (Tsp45I) comparing patient DNA to normal DNA controls. The text also mentions analysis of SNCA mRNA levels in patient RNA compared to normal controls.

Here's my assessment following the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart:

This JSON object represents my assessment of the SNCA c.157G>A variant according to the ACMG guidelines. The variant showed very strong pathogenic evidence (PS3_very_strong) based on functional assays demonstrating significant differences in mRNA levels between patient and control samples.

The assessment followed the complete ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart:
1. Defined the disease mechanism involving the SNCA gene
2. Evaluated the applicability of the assay method (PCR with restriction digestion)
3. Assessed the quality of controls and replicates
4. Analyzed statistical significance and correlated with OddsPath values
