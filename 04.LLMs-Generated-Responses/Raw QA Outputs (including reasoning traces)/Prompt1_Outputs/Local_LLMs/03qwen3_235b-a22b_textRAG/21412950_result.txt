Based on the provided context and figures, no specific genetic variants (e.g., missense mutations, splice variants) are explicitly mentioned in the text. While the text discusses general methodologies for evaluating functional evidence of genetic variants in Parkinson's disease (PD) using tools like Panther, SIFT, and structural integrity assessments, it does not provide details on specific variants (e.g., PINK1 G309D, L206V) that would allow their functional characterization to be parsed according to the ACMG flowchart.

The context highlights approaches for evaluating the pathogenicity of variants, such as assessing kinase activity, structural integrity, and computational predictions (Panther, SIFT), but no concrete examples of variants with functional data are provided. For instance, the text refers to "PD-causing mutations" and mentions PINK1, GSK3, JAK2/NTRK1, and MAP2K-kinases but does not name specific amino acid changes or variants for which functional assays have been conducted.

Without explicit variant details, the ACMG flowchart cannot be applied to individual variants to determine the strength of functional evidence (PS3/BS3). The JSON output must therefore remain empty, as the required information for variant-level assessment is absent from the provided text.
