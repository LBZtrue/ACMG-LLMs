Based on the provided context, the following variant has been assessed:

1. PINK1 WREV variant

The functional evidence aims to show pathogenicity. The paper demonstrates that loss of PINK1 function leads to reduced EJP amplitude in mutants compared to controls, indicating a pathogenic mechanism.

The assessment steps followed the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart:

Step 1: The disease mechanism was defined as reduced EJP amplitude in PINK1 mutants.
Step 2: The general class of assay (electrophysiological recordings of EJPs) was deemed applicable for modeling PD pathogenesis.
Step 3a: Basic controls (wild-type and mutants) and replication (n=4) were included.
Step 3c: Variant controls (REV and B9) were used.
Step 4a: Statistical analyses were insufficient to calculate OddsPath.
Step 4b: The number of variant controls was not explicitly stated, leading to a conservative judgment.

The final evidence strength is PS3_supporting for the PINK1 WREV variant based on the functional assays showing reduced EJP amplitude compared to controls, with appropriate controls and replication, but without explicit OddsPath calculation.

The assessment concludes that the PINK1 WREV variant shows evidence supporting pathogenicity based on functional data.

Step 1: The disease mechanism was defined as reduced EJP amplitude in PINK1 mutants.
Step 2: The general class of assay (electrophysiological recordings of EJPs) was deemed applicable for modeling PD pathogenesis.
Step 3a: Basic controls (wild-type and mutants) and replication (n=4) were included.
Step 3c: Variant controls (REV and B9) were used.
Step 4a: Statistical analyses were insufficient to calculate OddsPath.
Step 4b: The number of variant controls was not explicitly stated, leading to a conservative judgment.

The final evidence strength is PS3_supporting for the PINK1 WREV variant based on the functional assays showing reduced EJP amplitude compared to controls, with appropriate controls and replication, but without explicit OddsPath calculation.

The assessment concludes that the PINK1 WREV variant shows evidence supporting pathogenicity based on functional data.
