Looking at the provided text, I can identify one variant with functional data: G309D in PINK1.

I've based this assessment on the information provided in the text, which mentions the G309D variant in PINK1 and its effect on apoptosis compared to wild-type PINK1. The text specifically reports statistical significance (*P >0.01) for the difference between G309D and wild-type PINK1, indicating a measurable functional effect of this variant.
The text describes experiments measuring:
1. Apoptosis using FACS analysis of annexin staining
2. Mitochondrial membrane potential using TMRM fluorescence

The text also mentions that the experiments were performed with sufficient replication ("n = 8 data sets from three independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate") and appropriate statistical analysis (ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction).
Context:
The text describes experiments using a cDNA library from human substantia nigra (a brain region affected in Parkinson's disease) and mentions analyzing the effect of wild-type and mutant PINK1 on apoptosis. This context supports the interpretation that the assays are relevant to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, which is the disease associated with PINK1 mutations.
Answer:
I'll analyze the provided text to extract functional evidence details for gene variants mentioned in the paper.

First, let me identify the variants and relevant information:

1. Variant: G309D in PINK1 gene
   - Described in text: "Effect of wild-type and mutant PINK1 on apoptosis"
   - Functional assay: FACS of annexin staining to measure apoptosis
   - Additional assay: TMRM fluorescence to measure mitochondrial membrane potential
   - Statistical analysis: ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction
   - Significance: *P >0.01 for G309D versus wild-type PINK1
   - Replication: n = 8 data sets from three independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate

This assessment is based on the information provided in the text, which describes experiments measuring:
1. Apoptosis using FACS analysis of annexin staining
2. Mitochondrial membrane potential using TMRM fluorescence

The text also mentions that the experiments were performed with sufficient replication ("n = 8 data sets from three independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate") and appropriate statistical analysis (ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction).

The context of using a cDNA library from human substantia nigra (a brain region affected in Parkinson's disease) further supports the relevance of these assays to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, which is the disease associated with PINK1 mutations.
Context:
The text describes experiments using a cDNA library from human substantia nigra (a brain region affected in Parkinson's disease) and mentions analyzing the effect of wild-type and mutant PINK1 on apoptosis. This context supports the interpretation that the assays are relevant to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, which is the disease associated with PINK1 mutations.
