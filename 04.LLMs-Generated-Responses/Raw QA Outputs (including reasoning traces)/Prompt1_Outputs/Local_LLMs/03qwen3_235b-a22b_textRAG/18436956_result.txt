I need to analyze the provided literature text and assess functional evidence for DJ-1 gene variants according to the ACMG guidelines. Let me systematically analyze the information:

First, let me identify all variants mentioned in the text:
1. M26I
2. E64D
3. A104T
4. D149A
5. L166P

Now let me analyze each variant for functional evidence:

1. **L166P variant**
   - Mentioned in the text: "a comparing the L166P mutant with wild-type DJ-1 and an SDS-PAGE gel of purified DJ-1."
   - This is the only specific functional information provided in the text
   - The text indicates that SDS-PAGE was used to compare the mutant with wild-type DJ-1
   
2. **Other variants (M26I, E64D, A104T, D149A)**
   - The text explicitly states: "no functional studies have been reported" for these "intermediate" mutations
   - No specific functional data is provided for these variants

Based on this analysis, I can only assess the L166P variant for functional evidence since no functional studies are reported for the others. Let me apply the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart to the L166P variant:

For the L166P variant, the only assay mentioned is SDS-PAGE comparison with wild-type DJ-1. This is a very basic biochemical assay that shows differences in protein migration but doesn't directly assess functional impact.

Now I'll format this assessment according to the required JSON structure:

The E64D variant was mentioned in the figures but no specific information was provided about functional studies for this variant. The text only discusses M26I, A104T, and D149A as the "intermediate" mutations with no functional studies reported.

I've provided assessments for all variants mentioned in the text except E64D, for which insufficient information is available. Each variant assessment follows the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart as requested.

Based on the provided text, I need to assess functional evidence for DJ-1 gene variants according to the ACMG guidelines. However, after carefully reviewing the text, I find that:

1. For the L166P variant, the only functional information provided is: "a comparing the L166P mutant with wild-type DJ-1 and an SDS-PAGE gel of purified DJ-1." This is extremely limited information about a basic biochemical assay.

2. For the M26I, A104T, and D149A variants, the text explicitly states: "no functional studies have been reported" for these "intermediate" mutations.

3. The text does not provide any functional evidence for the E64D variant.

The provided text is also incomplete, with the discussion section cutting off mid-sentence: "Although such mutations are relatively rare as a cause of PD (Pankratz et al. 2006), they nevertheless provide an opportunity to uncover pathways that are involved in the etiology of this syndrome. To do so, it is imperative to elucidate the relevan"

Given these limitations, I cannot properly apply the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart to any of the variants, as I don't have sufficient information about the functional assays, their methodology, results, or interpretations.

Therefore, the appropriate response is an empty array, as no proper functional evidence assessment can be conducted based on the provided text.
