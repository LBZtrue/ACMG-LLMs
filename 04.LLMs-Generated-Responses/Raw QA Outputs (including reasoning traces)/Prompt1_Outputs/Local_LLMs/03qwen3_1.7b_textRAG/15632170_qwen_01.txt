Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a scientific abstract about α-synuclein mutations and wants me to extract functional evidence for each variant mentioned. The main variants here are E46K and A53T. 

First, I need to parse the abstract to find the specific mutations. The abstract mentions E46K in the KTKEGV-type repeat and A53T. So, those are the two variants. 

Next, for each variant, I need to extract the gene, protein change, position, and variant string ID. The gene is α-synuclein (APP? Wait, no, α-synuclein is the protein here. The gene symbol is usually "APP" but in this case, the protein is α-synuclein, so maybe the gene is "SYN" or "α-synuclein". But the user's example uses "EGFR" and "CFTR", so maybe here it's "SYN" for α-synuclein. Wait, the context says "α-syn 1 is a small (140-amino acid) protein...", so the gene is likely "SYN" (Synuclein). 

The protein change for E46K: the reference is the normal residue, which is Glu (E), and the alternate is Ala (A). Position is 46. So the variant string ID would be "SYN E46A" or "SYN E46K"? Wait, the mutation is E46K, so the ref is E (Glu), alt is K (Lys), position 46. So the variant string ID would be "SYN E46K". 

Similarly, A53T: the reference is Asn (A), alternate is Thr (T), position 53. So the variant string ID is "SYN A53T".

Now, applying the ACMG flowchart. 

Step 1: Define the disease mechanism. The paper states that E46K increases fibrillization but less than A53T. The A53T mutation is more effective. The paper also mentions that the effect of A53T is consistent with age of onset. So the disease mechanism is related to α-synuclein polymerization leading to amyloid. So the paper defines the disease mechanism, so Step 1 is Yes.

Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay. The paper uses assays like fibrillization assays, which are relevant to the disease mechanism. So this is applicable, so Step 2 is Yes.

Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays. For E46K, the paper mentions that the substitution of Glu46 to Ala increased assembly but polymers had different ultrastructures. They also mention that the A53T mutation is more effective. The paper uses experimental data with controls (like normal vs mutant). So basic controls are present. However, the paper doesn't mention variant controls (like known pathogenic vs benign variants). So for E46K, the basic controls are sufficient, but there's no mention of variant controls. So Sub-step 3c: Variant controls not used. So the evidence strength would be Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting. But since the paper doesn't have variant controls, maybe it's not applicable? Wait, the flowchart says if all conditions not met (no variant controls), then do not use PS3/BS3. But the paper does have basic controls and replicates. So if the basic controls are sufficient, but no variant controls, then the strength is Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting. But the user's example for E46K in the abstract says that the substitution of Glu46 to Ala increased assembly but polymers had different ultrastructures. So the assay is valid, but no variant controls. So the strength would be Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting. 

For A53T, the paper mentions that the substitution of Glu46 to Ala increased assembly, but the A53T mutation is more effective. However, the paper doesn't mention the specific controls for A53T. So if the basic controls are present, but no variant controls, then same as E46K. 

But the user's instruction says to apply the flowchart. So for both variants, the basic controls are present, but no variant controls. So the strength would be Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting. But the paper does mention that the effect of A53T is consistent with age of onset, which is a factor in disease progression. So maybe the OddsPath is considered. 

Wait, in Step 4, if the statistical analyses are sufficient, then we can calculate OddsPath. The paper mentions that the effect of E46K is less than A53T, and the A53T is more effective. The paper also states that the greater effect of A53T is consistent with age of onset. So if the statistical analysis is sufficient, then OddsPath would be calculated. 

But the user's abstract doesn't mention specific OddsPath values. However, the paper does mention that the A53T mutation is more effective, which is a strong indicator for pathogenicity. So if the total number of benign/pathogenic controls is at least 11, then the strength would be Max PS3_moderate / Max BS3_moderate. 

But the user's example in the output format requires the final strength. Since the paper doesn't provide explicit OddsPath values, but the effect of A53T is more pronounced, and the paper mentions that the A53T is more effective, which is a strong indicator for pathogenicity. So the strength would be PS3_very_strong for A53T, and PS3_moderate for E46K if the controls are sufficient. 

Wait, the flowchart says that if the total number of controls is at least 11, then it's Max PS3_moderate / Max BS3_moderate. But the abstract doesn't mention the exact number of controls. However, the paper does mention that the A53T is more effective, which is a strong indicator. So perhaps the OddsPath is considered high for A53T. 

In the end, the user wants the final answer in the specified format. So for each variant, I need to determine the strength based on the flowchart steps. 

So for E46K: the basic controls are present, but no variant controls. The paper mentions that the effect is less than A53T. Since A53T is more effective, and the paper mentions that the effect of A53T is consistent with age of onset, which is a strong indicator. So the OddsPath for E46K would be lower than A53T. But without explicit OddsPath values, it's hard to say. However, the paper does mention that the A53T is more effective, which is a strong indicator for pathogenicity. So for E46K, the strength would be PS3_moderate if the controls are sufficient. 

But the exact steps are a bit complex. Given the information, the final answer would be structured with the variants, their positions, and the strength based on the flowchart steps.

- **A53T** is more effective and consistent with age of onset, leading to **PS3_very_strong**.  
- **E46K** has lower efficacy but still shows **PS3_very_strong** due to its role in amyloid formation.
