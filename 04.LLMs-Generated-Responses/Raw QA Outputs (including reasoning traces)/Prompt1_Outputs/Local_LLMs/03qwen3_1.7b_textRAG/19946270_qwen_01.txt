Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a scientific abstract about PARK2 mutations in cancer and wants me to extract functional evidence for each variant mentioned. First, I need to identify any variants mentioned in the text. The abstract mentions "inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic deletions of PARK2 in human malignancies." But there's no specific variant ID given, like a specific amino acid change. Wait, the user might be expecting me to infer the variant based on the context, even if it's not explicitly stated. However, the instructions mention that I should extract variant identification information, including Gene, Protein Change (ref, alt, position), and variant_string_id. 

Looking at the abstract, it talks about mutations in PARK2, but the specific mutations (like which amino acids are changed) aren't mentioned. The text says "inactivating somatic mutations" and "intragenic deletions," but these are not specific to a particular amino acid. So, perhaps there's a lack of specific variant data here. But the user might be assuming that the variants are the ones causing the mutations, even without specific positions. However, the standard for variant identification requires specific positions. 

Wait, the user's question might be based on the assumption that there are specific variants mentioned in the paper, but in the provided abstract, there's no explicit mention of specific mutations. The abstract mentions "inactivating somatic mutations" and "intragenic deletions," but not specific amino acid changes. Therefore, for the variant identification, we might not have the ref, alt, or position. But the user's instructions say to extract this information. If the paper doesn't mention specific mutations, then the variant_string_id can't be determined. However, the user might be expecting me to proceed with the information available, even if it's incomplete.

But the user's example in the output format shows that for a variant, the variant_string_id is like "EGFR L858R". Since the provided text doesn't mention specific mutations (like L858R), maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects that the variants are the ones causing the mutations, even without specific positions. However, without specific positions, the variant_string_id can't be accurately formed. 

So, in this case, since the paper doesn't mention specific mutations (like specific amino acid changes), we can't extract the ref, alt, position. Therefore, the variant_string_id can't be determined. But the user might expect that the variant is PARK2 with some mutations, but without specific positions, the variant_string_id can't be formed. 

However, the user's instructions might be expecting that even if the specific mutations aren't mentioned, the variant is still considered. But according to the guidelines, the variant_string_id requires specific positions. Therefore, in this case, there's no valid variant to assess, leading to the conclusion that the evidence is not applicable (Do not use PS3/BS3). 

But the user's example in the output format shows that even if the variant is not specified, the variant_string_id is "Gene RefPosAlt". However, in this case, since the specific mutations aren't mentioned, the variant_string_id can't be formed. Therefore, the answer would indicate that there's no valid variant to assess, and thus the evidence is not applicable. 

But the user's question might be testing if I can handle cases where the specific mutations aren't mentioned. However, according to the instructions, the variant_string_id requires specific information. Therefore, in this case, the answer would be that there's no valid variant to assess, and thus the functional evidence is not applicable. 

But the user's initial context mentions that the paper discusses PARK2 mutations in cancer, but without specific positions. Therefore, the answer would have to state that the variant information isn't available, leading to the conclusion that the evidence isn't applicable. 

So, putting it all together, the answer would be that there's no specific variant with known positions to assess, hence the functional evidence is not applicable. Therefore, the final output would have the variant_id with missing data, and the assessment steps would indicate that the evidence isn't applicable.
