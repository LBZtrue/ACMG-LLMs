          "judgment": "Yes",
          "reasoning": "Assessing protein expression changes in mitochondria is a relevant assay class because the disease mechanism implicates mitochondrial dysfunction. Alterations in mitochondrial protein expression directly reflect the functional state of mitochondria and can contribute to the disease phenotype."
