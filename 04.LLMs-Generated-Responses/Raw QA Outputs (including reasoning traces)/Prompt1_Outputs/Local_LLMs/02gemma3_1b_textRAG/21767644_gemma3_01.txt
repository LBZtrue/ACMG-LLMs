The mutation induced in α-syn leads to a loss of synaptic function, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of PD.",

They use a PCR and immunostaining assay to quantify the mutant protein deposition in dopaminergic neurons, and a specific model was used to study this process.",

The observation of reduced dopamine and metabolites in the OB is consistent with the hypothesis that α-syn mutations disrupt dopaminergic neuronal function.",

This modulation could underlie in part some of the early neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD preceding dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.",
