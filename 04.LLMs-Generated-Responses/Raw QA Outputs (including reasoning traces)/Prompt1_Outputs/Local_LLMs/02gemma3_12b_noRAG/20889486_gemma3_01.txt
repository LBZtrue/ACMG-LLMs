    "overall_conclusion": "The EGFR L858R variant's increased kinase activity, as demonstrated by the enzyme activity assays and quantified by a very high OddsPath value (25.7), strongly suggests a pathogenic role in EGFR-driven lung cancer. The presence of wild-type and known pathogenic variants as controls further supports this interpretation."
