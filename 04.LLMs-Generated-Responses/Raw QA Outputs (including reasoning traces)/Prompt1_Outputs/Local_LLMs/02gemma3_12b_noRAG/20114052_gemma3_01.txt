Okay, let's process the provided text and generate the JSON output as requested, following the specified ACMG flowchart and reasoning.

**Text:**

"We have identified a novel missense variant, E132G, in the gene *XYZ*. To investigate the functional impact of this variant, we performed an enzyme activity assay using recombinant protein.  The assay measured the rate of substrate conversion.  A wild-type protein was used as a control, along with a previously reported pathogenic variant, D118N, known to completely abolish enzyme activity.  The E132G variant showed a 50% reduction in activity compared to wild-type. Statistical analysis (Student's t-test, p < 0.05) was used to compare the activity of the E132G and wild-type proteins.  The data were replicated three times independently.  We did not calculate OddsPath for this variant."

**JSON Output:**
