EGFR mutations lead to constitutive activation of the receptor, bypassing normal growth control signals.",

        "judgment": "Yes",
        "reasoning": "Measuring enzyme activity is a relevant assay for assessing the impact of EGFR mutations as the mutant protein will likely alter kinase function. This aligns with the disease mechanism.",

The well-defined assay, with controls and replicates, coupled with the quantitative evidence provided by the high OddsPath, strongly indicates a pathogenic role for this mutation in EGFR-driven NSCLC."
