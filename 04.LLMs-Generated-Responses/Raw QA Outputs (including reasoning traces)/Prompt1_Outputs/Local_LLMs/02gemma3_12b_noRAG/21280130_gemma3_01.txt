This is a relevant assay as aberrant enzymatic activity of A20 could disrupt NF-kB regulation and contribute to disease.",

    "overall_conclusion": "The significantly reduced enzymatic activity and very high OddsPath (25.7) for the A20 1013T variant strongly suggests that this variant impairs A20's ability to regulate NF-kB signaling, contributing to its pathogenic effect. The presence of wild type and other mutant controls and multiple replicates support the reliability of the data."
