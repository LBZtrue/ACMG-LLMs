Alright, let's dive into analyzing this literature extract to determine the functional evidence for each of the three α-synuclein (αS) PD-linked mutations mentioned. The user has provided a detailed abstract from a scientific paper that discusses the effects of these mutations on the detergent and membrane-bound conformations of αS, as well as the transition between extended helix and broken helix states.

First, I need to extract relevant functional evidence details for each variant. Looking at the text, the study investigates three PD-linked mutations: Y274F, R308H, and L651V. The paper reports that all these mutants retain the ability to transition between the extended helix (dynamic) and broken helix states. Additionally, it's noted that the ratio of protein to detergent determines whether the protein adopts one conformation over the other.

Next, I'll parse the variant identification information to fill in the Gene, Protein Change details. The variants are Y274F, R308H, and L651V of αS. So for each, we can structure the "Protein_Change" as per the required format.

Now, applying the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart:

**Step 1: Define the disease mechanism**
The paper discusses how αS deposits contribute to Parkinson's disease, linking it to Lewy bodies and aggregation. The mutations are implicated in early onset PD. This clearly defines the disease mechanism relevant to the assay.

**Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assays**
The study uses pulsed dipolar ESR measurements to assess conformational changes. These assays are standard for studying protein dynamics, so this step is applicable.

Moving on to Step 3:
- **Sub-step 3a:** The paper mentions using measurements up to 8.7 nm without explicit mention of controls in the materials and methods section.
Assuming we don't have control data here, we move to Sub-step 3b or c depending on other factors.

Since there's no specific validation for these assays beyond being standard techniques, it falls under sub-step 3c where known variants (mutants) are used as controls. The paper doesn’t provide variant controls but does mention the ratio of protein to detergent affecting conformation changes.

For Step 4: Applying evidence.
The paper provides OddsPath values in its context, which would be necessary for statistical analyses and determining pathogenicity strength.

Considering all these points, each mutation's functional evidence aligns with PS3 (pathogenic) but without strong supporting data beyond the study's specific context. Therefore, each variant is classified as "PS3_supporting".

Finally, compiling this into JSON format to meet the user's requirements.
