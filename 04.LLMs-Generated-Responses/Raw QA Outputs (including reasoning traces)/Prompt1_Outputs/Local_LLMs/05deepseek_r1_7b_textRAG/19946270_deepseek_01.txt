Alright, I need to analyze the provided scientific abstract and main text to extract functional evidence details for each variant mentioned in the context of their potential pathogenicity or benignity.

First, looking at the variants discussed:

1. **PARK2 mutations**: These are both germline and somatic mutations. The germline mutations cause familial Parkinson's (PD), while the somatic mutations in cancer reduce the growth-suppressive effects of PARK2 by decreasing its E3 ligase activity, leading to mitotic instability.

From the flowchart:

- **Step 1: Define disease mechanism**: The paper defines that mutations in PARK2 lead to neurodegenerative diseases like PD. For germline mutations, it's familial, while somatic mutations in cancer affect growth signals.
  
- **Step 2: Evaluate class of assays**: The functional assay here is based on the effects observed (mitotic instability and E3 ligase activity reduction), which align with known molecular mechanisms.

Moving to Step 3:

- **Sub-steps 3a, 3b, 3c** apply. Since there are no specific controls mentioned beyond the general behavior in cancer cells and the known mechanism in germline mutations, it's challenging to validate variant-specific controls.

Without variant controls or additional supporting data from controls, we can't proceed further for PS3/BS3 evidence. Therefore, the strength is assigned as "PS3_supporting" due to the inferred pathogenicity from the general mechanism.
