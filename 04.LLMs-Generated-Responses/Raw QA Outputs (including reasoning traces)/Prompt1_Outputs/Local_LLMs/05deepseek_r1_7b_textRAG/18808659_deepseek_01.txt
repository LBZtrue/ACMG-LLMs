Alright, I need to evaluate the functional evidence for each of the three missense mutations in α-syn linked to familial Parkinson's disease as described in the provided scientific paper. The task is broken down into several steps, so I'll go through them one by one.

First, I should extract relevant functional evidence details from the paper for each variant: A30P, A53T, and E46K. Then, parse the variant identification information to fill in the specific fields like "Gene", "Protein Change", and "variant_string_id".

Looking at the paper's abstract and sections, I see that co-incubation with brain cytosol increases α-syn binding to synaptic membranes for both wild-type (WT) and mutant α-syn. Specifically, A53T is affected, but A30P isn't. The study also mentions that lipids like C16:0 PAF are required to enhance membrane interactions for WT and A53T α-syn.

So, each variant has its own context:
- **A30P**: No functional data provided about its effect on binding.
- **A53T**: Impaired binding is shown with or without certain factors.
- **E46K**: Similar to A53T in terms of increased membrane interactions when co-incubated.

Next, I'll need to apply the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart for each variant. The flowchart has four main steps: Define disease mechanism, Evaluate assay applicability, Assess specific assay validity, and Apply evidence to individual variants.

For **A30P**, since there's no mention of its effect on binding in the presence or absence of cytosolic factors, I can't confirm if it's pathogenic based on this study alone. So, Step 1 would likely say "No" because the mechanism isn't clearly defined here.

**A53T**: The paper shows that co-incubation enhances membrane interactions for A53T α-syn. They used lipids and ATP as cytosolic factors. This suggests a functional effect on binding, so Step 1 would be "Yes." Then in Step 2, since they evaluated the general class of assays (like using lipids), it's applicable, moving to Step 3.

In **Sub-step 3a**, both controls should be present, but I don't see any mention of specific controls used for these assays. So, Step 3 would say "No," leading us to assign supporting strength based on the presence of known mechanisms without solid controls.

For each variant, after evaluating all steps, I'll determine if they meet the criteria for PS3 (pathogenic) or BS3 (benign). If there's no strong evidence from controls or statistical data, it would fall under supporting but not reaching PS3 or BS3.

Here is a structured assessment of each α-syn variant based on the provided scientific paper and the outlined evaluation flowchart:
