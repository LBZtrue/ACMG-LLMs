Alright, I need to analyze this query about extracting functional evidence from a scientific paper related to the alpha synuclein gene variants involved in Parkinson's disease. The user has provided a detailed abstract of their research and wants me to extract relevant information step by step according to the ACMG flowchart.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully to understand what each variant does. They mention two variants: wild type (WT) and mutant A30P. Both are expressed in PC12/TetOn cells. The study assesses their aggregation levels and toxicity when expressed at different doses.

From Step 1 of the flowchart, I need to define the disease mechanism. The paper discusses that PD is caused by alpha synuclein aggregation. So, this aligns with understanding the molecular basis of PD, which means Step 1 judgment should be "Yes".

Next, in Step 2, it's about evaluating if the assays used are applicable to the disease mechanism defined in Step 1. The study uses cell toxicity and aggregation as endpoints measured by H2O2-induced oxidative stress. These relate directly to alpha synuclein function, so I'll say Step 2 is "Yes".

Moving to Step 3, it's about evaluating specific assay validations. They mention using proteasome inhibition (MG132) and macroautophagy inhibitors (3-MA). When they inhibit these pathways, the WT protein doesn't aggregate or cause cell death, while A30P still shows some toxicity.

Sub-step 3a asks if basic controls are used. The study mentions that cells were grown in multiple conditions: WT with/without aggregation and A30P with/without. However, they don't explicitly state whether "Normal/Negative/Wild type" or "Abnormal/Positive/Null" controls were included. Also, there's no mention of replicates beyond stating experiments were performed in triplicate.

Since the basic controls aren't clearly described as used (they only mention multiple conditions without specific controls), Sub-step 3a judgment is "No".

In Sub-step 3b, they tried to use alternative validations but didn't have prior validation or references. Without any of these, Sub-step 3b is also "No", so we don't gain supporting evidence.

Sub-step 3c checks for variant controls. They tested known pathogenic (WT) and mutant (A30P) variants in the same assay, which means they used variant controls with stated classifications. So this judgment is "Yes".

Now moving to Step 4: applying evidence to individual variants. 

In Sub-step 4a, the paper mentions using a triplicate for experiments but doesn't provide statistical analyses or OddsPath values. Therefore, no statistical info is present here.

Sub-step 4b asks about variant controls and their number of total uses in assays. They used both WT (negative) and A30P (positive), with data from multiple conditions but not explicitly counting how many variants were tested beyond these two. Without specific numbers on total controls, I can't determine if it's ≤10 or ≥11. Since they only mention testing the two variants in their model, this would be 2 controls, so it falls under ≤10.

Lastly, without statistical data (4a) and having ≤10 controls (4b), the best we can do is assign supporting evidence for both WT and A30P.

Putting it all together, each variant's strength is PS3_supporting because they have variant controls but lack sufficient statistical analysis or enough variant controls to reach higher strengths.
