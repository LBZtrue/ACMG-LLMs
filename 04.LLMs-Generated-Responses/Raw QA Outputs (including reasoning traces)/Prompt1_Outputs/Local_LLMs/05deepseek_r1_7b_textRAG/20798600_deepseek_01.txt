Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the functional evidence for the variants PINK1 L858R, Parkin R117H, and Parkin mutations in the context of selective mitophagy and neurodegenerative diseases. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the abstract and introduction, I see that both genes are implicated in the pathway leading to mitophagy, which is linked to neurodegeneration like Parkinson's disease (pD). The paper mentions that PINK1 and Parkin are involved in selective autophagy for clearing damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy precedes other hallmarks of neurodegeneration, so this process seems crucial early on.

The specific variants mentioned include PINK1 L858R and Parkin R117H, along with Parkin mutations that interfere with mitophagy at different steps. The paper also notes that these deletions in the mitochondrial membrane potential are necessary for initiating mitophagy via autophagy (macrophage-mediated).

Now, moving on to extracting functional evidence details:

For PINK1 L858R: It's mentioned that this mutation is downstream of Parkin and involved in selective mitophagy. The paper states that the physical binding activity between PINK1 and Parkin is reduced due to mutations. This suggests a direct functional impact, which supports its pathogenic potential.

For Parkin R117H: This variant disrupts the interaction with mitochondria or PINK1, as per the abstract. Since Parkin's role in mitophagy is compromised, this likely leads to defective selective autophagy, supporting its classification as a pathogenic variant.

Next, applying the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart:

Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.
The paper clearly describes how PINK1 and Parkin function within the mitochondrial degeneration pathway leading to neurodegeneration. This provides strong information about the molecular basis of pD, which is essential for assessing functional variants.

Step 2: Evaluate general classes of assays.
Since the focus here is on genetic variants' impact on disease mechanisms via mitophagy, the general class of assay (functional studies correlating gene mutations with pathophysiology) applies. Thus, moving to Step 3.

Sub-step 3a: Basic controls and replicates. The paper doesn't mention specific controls or replicates for this particular assay, so we proceed to Sub-step 3b.

Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay.
The study cites prior validation of the mitophagy pathway in other contexts but doesn't specifically address whether this instance was validated. Therefore, it falls under "Not applicable," and PS3 isn't used here.

Since we can't use PS3 or BS3 for these variants, their strength remains N/A based on the given criteria.
