The table shows the results for three different R-synuclein protein variants (Pathogenic Variant, Benign Variant, and Wild Type) in a protein interaction assay used to study Parkinson's disease. The assessments were done following four steps: defining the disease mechanism, evaluating the applicability of the assay, evaluating the validity of the specific instance of the assay, and applying evidence to individual variant interpretation.

The assessment results suggest that the protein interaction assay is a suitable method for studying Parkinson's disease since it effectively models or reflects the disease pathogenesis/mechanism defined in Step 1 by providing insights into how proteins interact within the disease context. However, the table does not provide enough information to determine the functional evidence strength of each variant (Pathogenic Variant, Benign Variant, and Wild Type) using this assay.
