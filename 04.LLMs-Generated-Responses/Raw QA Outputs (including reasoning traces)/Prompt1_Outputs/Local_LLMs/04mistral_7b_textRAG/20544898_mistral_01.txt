In the provided paper, no specific assays were described for the wildtype a-Synuclein protein. Therefore, it was not possible to calculate OddsPath or determine the functional evidence strength based on statistical analyses or the number of controls used in this case. However, since the protein's function is directly related to PD pathogenesis, and the study describes how point mutations and gene duplications of a-Synuclein contribute to early-onset familial PD, it can be assumed that any future studies using relevant assays would provide valuable functional evidence for this protein.
