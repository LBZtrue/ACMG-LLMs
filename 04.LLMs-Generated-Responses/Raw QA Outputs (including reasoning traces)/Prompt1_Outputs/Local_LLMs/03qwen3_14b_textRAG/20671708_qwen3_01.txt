Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract functional evidence for specific variants from the provided paper and apply the ACMG flowchart. First, I need to identify the variants mentioned in the text.

Looking at the abstract and the main text, the variants discussed are I1915T and G2019S in LRRK2. The paper mentions that these are pathogenic mutations. Also, there's a kinase-dead variant, dLRRK(3KD), which is likely benign since it's described as not affecting reporter expression.

Next, I need to parse the variant information. For I1915T and G2019S, the gene is LRRK2. The protein changes are I to T at position 1915 and G to S at position 2019. The variant string IDs would be LRRK2 I1915T and LRRK2 G2019S. The kinase-dead variant is dLRRK(3KD), but since the position isn't specified, I might need to handle that. However, the paper might not have the exact position, so maybe I can note that it's a kinase-dead variant but not specify the position.

Now, applying the ACMG flowchart. Step 1: Define the disease mechanism. The paper clearly states that LRRK2 mutations cause PD and that they affect miRNA pathways. So the answer here is Yes. 

Step 2: Evaluate the assay's applicability. The assays used are reporter gene assays with EGFP-let-7-3'UTR, which are relevant to the disease mechanism. So this step is Yes, proceed to Step 3.

Step 3a: Check controls and replicates. The paper mentions that loss of dicer-1 or ago1 enhanced reporter expression, and that pathogenic proteins (I1915T and G2019S) stimulated reporter expression more than WT. Also, dLRRK RNAi decreased reporter expression. It also mentions that kinase-dead variants didn't affect expression. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention multiple replicates or controls like wild-type vs. mutant. So maybe the basic controls are present (like WT vs. pathogenic), but the number of replicates isn't clear. The paper might have used multiple experiments but doesn't state "n=3" or similar. This could lead to proceeding to Sub-step 3b.

Step 3b: Check if the assay is validated. The reporter assay is a standard method in miRNA studies, so it's likely accepted. Therefore, the functional evidence is Max PS3_supporting.

But wait, the paper also mentions that the kinase-dead variant didn't affect reporter expression. That might be a control. However, the user's instructions specify to assess each variant mentioned. The variants are I1915T, G2019S, and 3KD.

For I1915T and G2019S, the assays show that they increase reporter expression, which correlates with toxicity. Since the paper uses these variants to demonstrate pathogenicity, the evidence is strong. The kinase-dead variant (3KD) is a control, but since it's not a variant of interest (the user might not have asked for it, but the text mentions it), but the user's instruction says to extract variants with functional data. The paper shows that 3KD doesn't affect the reporter, which might be used as a benign control.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to extract variants mentioned that have functional data. The paper discusses both pathogenic and benign variants (3KD). However, the question might be focused on the pathogenic variants, as the functional evidence aims to show pathogenicity.

For the pathogenic variants (I1915T and G2019S), the evidence shows that they increase reporter expression compared to WT, which is linked to toxicity. The assays are relevant, and even though the controls might not be fully detailed, the assays are standard. So the functional evidence strength is PS3_supporting.

For the kinase-dead variant (3KD), since it's not a variant of interest but a control, and the paper shows it doesn't affect the reporter, but the user might not want to include it unless it's a variant. The text mentions dLRRK(3KD) as a kinase-dead variant, but since the user is asking for variants with functional data, and the paper states that it didn't affect reporter expression, maybe it's considered a benign variant. However, the user's instruction might not require including it unless it's explicitly mentioned as a variant. The original text mentions "kinase-dead variant, dLRRK(3KD)", which is a variant, but the user might not have asked for it. However, the user's instruction says to extract all variants mentioned with functional data.

So, I need to include all three variants. For I1915T and G2019S, the evidence supports pathogenicity. For 3KD, the evidence supports benignity.

But the user's question might focus on the pathogenic variants. However, the instructions say to extract all variants mentioned. Let's proceed with all three.

Now, applying the steps again for each variant.

For I1915T and G2019S:

Step 1: Yes, disease mechanism is defined.

Step 2: Yes, relevant assays.

Step 3a: Controls (WT vs. mutant) are present, but replicates are not explicitly stated. So proceed to 3b.

Step 3b: Assay is standard, so Max PS3_supporting.

Step 4: Since there's no statistical analysis with OddsPath, proceed to 4b. The number of control variants used: the paper uses WT, pathogenic (I1915T, G2019S), and 3KD. That's three variants. Since it's less than 10, the strength is Max PS3_supporting.

For 3KD:

Step 1: Yes, disease mechanism.

Step 2: Yes, assays are relevant.

Step 3a: Controls (WT vs. 3KD) are present, but replicates not specified. Proceed to 3b.

Step 3b: Assay is standard, so Max BS3_supporting.

Step 4: Since no OddsPath, check number of controls. The paper uses 3KD as a control, but maybe the number of controls is 3 (WT, I1915T, G2019S, 3KD). If that's 4, then less than 10, so Max BS3_supporting.

But the user's answer might not require the 3KD variant. However, the original text mentions it, so I should include it. However, the user's answer might focus on the pathogenic variants. Let me check the original text again.

The text says: "The kinase-dead variant, dLRRK(3KD), did not affect reporter expression." So that's a variant with functional data. Therefore, it should be included.

So, the answer includes three variants: I1915T, G2019S, and 3KD. But the user's initial instruction might have intended only the pathogenic ones. However, the user's instructions say to extract all variants with functional data. So proceed with all three.

Now, structuring the answer with each variant, their variant string, and the ACMG classification.
