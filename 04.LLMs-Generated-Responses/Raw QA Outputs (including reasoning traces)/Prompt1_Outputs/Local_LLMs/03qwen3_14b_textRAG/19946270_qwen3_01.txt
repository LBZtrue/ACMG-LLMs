Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract functional evidence details for each variant mentioned in the provided paper, apply the ACMG flowchart, and output the results in JSON format. First, I need to parse the given text to find any variants with functional data.

Looking at the context, the paper is about somatic mutations of the PARK2 gene in glioblastoma and other malignancies. However, the text provided doesn't mention any specific variants with their protein changes, such as missense, nonsense, or splice site mutations. The authors are discussing the presence of PARK2 mutations in cancer, but there's no detailed information on individual variants, their amino acid changes, or functional assays conducted on them.

The contributions section lists authors and their roles, but no variants are specified. The abstract and introduction likely discuss the role of PARK2 in cancer, but the detailed methods and results sections, which might have the variant information, are not included in the provided text. Without explicit mentions of variants (like p.Arg179His or similar), I can't extract the necessary data for the JSON output.

Since the user's instruction requires extracting each variant's details and applying the ACMG flowchart, but the provided text lacks such information, the answer would indicate that no variants with functional data were found. Therefore, the JSON array would be empty, and the overall conclusion would note the absence of specific variant details in the given context.
