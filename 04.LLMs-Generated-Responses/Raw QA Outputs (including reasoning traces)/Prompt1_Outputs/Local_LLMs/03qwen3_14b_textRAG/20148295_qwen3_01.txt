Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract functional evidence for each variant mentioned in the provided paper and apply the ACMG flowchart. First, I need to identify the variants. The abstract mentions three point mutations in αSyn associated with early-onset familial PD: A30P, E46K, and A53T. So those are the variants.

Next, I need to extract their gene, protein changes, and variant string IDs. The gene is α-synuclein, which is usually denoted as SNCA. The protein changes are A30P, E46K, A53T. The variant string IDs would be SNCA A30P, SNCA E46K, SNCA A53T.

Now, applying the ACMG flowchart. Step 1: Define the disease mechanism. The paper states that these mutations are linked to early-onset PD and affect αSyn's amyloidogenicity and vesicle-binding activity. The disease mechanism is related to αSyn aggregation and proteasome interaction. So the judgment here is "Yes" because the paper clearly defines the molecular basis.

Step 2: Evaluate the assay's applicability. The study uses proteasome and liposome interactions to assess fragmentation and conformation. These assays are relevant to the disease mechanism (proteasome cleavage leading to oligomer formation). So judgment is "Yes," proceed to Step 3.

Step 3a: Basic controls and replicates. The paper mentions using both mutant and wildtype αSyn, but I need to check if they used both normal and abnormal controls. The abstract says "the 20S proteasome produced C-terminal fragments from both mutant and wildtype αSyn." That suggests they compared mutant and wildtype, which might be considered as controls. However, it's not explicitly stated if they used known pathogenic or benign variants as controls. The results section might have more details, but the abstract doesn't mention replicates explicitly. So maybe "No" here, leading to Sub-step 3b.

Step 3b: Validated assay. The assays are about proteasome cleavage and oligomer formation, which are standard in the field. The paper doesn't mention prior validation or commercial kits, but the methods are common in proteasome studies. However, without explicit validation, this might be a "No," leading to not using PS3/BS3. But the user's instruction says to use the flowchart, so maybe I need to check again.

Wait, the paper is from Springer, and the methods are in vitro cleavage and fibrillization assays. These are established methods in the field. So the assay is accepted, so Sub-step 3b would be "Yes," leading to Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting. But the paper's results show that the rate of oligomer formation correlates with the mutations, which is the functional evidence.

Proceeding to Step 4: Apply evidence. The paper doesn't mention statistical analyses like OddsPath. So Sub-step 4a: "No," proceed to 4b. The number of control variants is not specified, but the study includes three mutations compared to wildtype. If the study has only three variants, that's less than 10, so the strength is Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting.

But the paper's conclusion is that the rate of oligomer formation correlates with the mutations, which is a direct functional effect. So even though the controls might be limited, the evidence is strong enough to support pathogenicity. However, the ACMG flowchart might require more controls. Since the paper doesn't mention statistical significance or OddsPath, the functional evidence would be supporting, not very strong.

Putting it all together, each variant would have PS3_supporting as the strength. The overall conclusion would be that the mutations increase oligomer formation, which is pathogenic.
