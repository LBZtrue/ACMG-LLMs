Alright, I need to analyze the provided scientific paper to assess the functional evidence for each variant mentioned. The paper focuses on two LRRK2 mutants, I2020T and G2019S, and their sensitivity to kinase inhibitors.

First, I'll extract the relevant information about each variant. Both variants are in the LRRK2 gene. G2019S is a glycine to serine substitution at position 2019, while I2020T is an isoleucine to threonine substitution at position 2020.

Looking at the abstract and introduction, the paper states that these mutations are associated with Parkinson's disease and affect LRRK2 kinase activity. G2019S has higher activity in kinase assays, whereas I2020T shows lower activity in substrate phosphorylation but higher in autophosphorylation.

The methods section mentions binding and enzymatic assays. For ATP affinity, G2019S has 2-fold lower affinity, making it more sensitive to inhibitors, while I2020T has 6-fold higher affinity, making it more resistant. At cellular ATP levels (1 mM), I2020T is 10-fold more resistant, and G2019S is 1.6-fold more sensitive.

Now, applying the ACMG functional evidence evaluation:

For each variant, Step 1: The disease mechanism is defined as altered kinase activity affecting PD pathogenesis. Both variants are linked to PD through their impact on LRRK2 function.

Step 2: The assay used is an in vitro kinase activity test, which directly models the enzyme's role in the disease. This is appropriate and relevant.

Step 3a: I need to check if basic controls (wild-type and known mutants) were included. The paper compares mutant activity against wild-type but doesn't explicitly mention negative controls like benign variants. However, since they use a standard assay, it's likely validated.

Assuming the assays are valid without explicit controls beyond wild-type, moving to Step 3b: The method is a standard enzymatic assay and widely accepted, so this supports the evidence.

Step 4: Since no statistical analysis is mentioned, we look at the number of control variants. The study uses wild-type as a control but doesn't mention other pathogenic or benign controls beyond these two mutants. However, each variant's data is compared to wild-type effectively.

Given that, the functional evidence is supporting but not definitive without more extensive controls or statistical analysis. Therefore, both variants would have moderate support based on their impact on kinase activity.
