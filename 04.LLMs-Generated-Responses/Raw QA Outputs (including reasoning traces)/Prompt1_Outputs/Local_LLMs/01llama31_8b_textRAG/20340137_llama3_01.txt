Based on the provided scientific paper, I will extract relevant information for each variant mentioned with functional data.

**Variant 1:** p.Ala53Thr
- Gene: SNCA (Alpha-Synuclein)
- Protein Change:
    - ref: Ala
    - alt: Thr
    - position: 53

The variant string ID is "SNCA Ala53Thr".

Here's the functional evidence assessment for this variant:

Since no OddsPath value was calculated or reported for this specific instance of the assay in the paper, I used Sub-step 4b. The study had at least one additional benign control variant but didn't provide enough information to calculate OddsPath. Therefore, according to ACMG guidelines, the final evidence strength is PS3_supporting.
