Please note that the ACMG guidelines for OddsPath interpretation are not explicitly provided in the original instructions. The values used here (PS3: OddsPath > 4.3 = moderate; OddsPath > 2.0 = supporting) are typical examples and might need to be adjusted according to specific ACMG recommendations or institutional policies.
