**E46K Variant OddsPath Calculation**

For E46K, we need to calculate OddsPath as per the paper:

"The OddsPath value calculated for this variant is 10.3 (95% CI: 6.5-16.1)."

Since the OddsPath value is greater than 4.3 and less than or equal to 18.7, the final evidence strength would be **PS3_moderate**.

**A53T Variant OddsPath Calculation**

For A53T, we need to calculate OddsPath as per the paper:

"The OddsPath value calculated for this variant is 5.6 (95% CI: 3.4-9.2)."

Since the OddsPath value is greater than 2.0 and less than or equal to 4.3, the final evidence strength would be **PS3_supporting**.
