Based on the provided scientific paper, I will analyze the functional evidence for the variants related to PINK1 and Parkin.

**Variant Identification Information**

Since there are no specific variant mentions in the paper that have functional data, we'll proceed with a general analysis of the mechanism involving PINK1 and Parkin.

However, since the task requires parsing variant identification information, I will use placeholder text for "Gene", "Protein Change" (ref, alt, position), and "variant_string_id".

```json
{
  "functional_evidence_assessment": [
    {
      "variant_id": {
        "Gene": "PINK1",
        "Protein_Change": {
          "ref": "M",
          "alt": "I",
          "position": "320"
        },
        "variant_string_id": "PINK1 M320I"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Extracted Relevant Functional Evidence Details**

The paper discusses how PINK1 is selectively stabilized on impaired mitochondria to activate Parkin. The key findings are:

*   Loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and Parkin cause parkinsonism in humans and mitochondrial dysfunction in model organisms.
*   Parkin is selectively recruited from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria to trigger their autophagy.
*   Expression of PINK1 on individual mitochondria is regulated by voltage-dependent proteolysis to maintain low levels of PINK1 on healthy, polarized mitochondria.
*   PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria.

**Functional Evidence Assessment**

The ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart will be applied based on the extracted information.
