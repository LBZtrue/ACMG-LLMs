**Variant L10P and P158DEL Comparison:**

Both variants show similar patterns in their assessment steps. They both have reduced protein stability compared to wild-type DJ-1 protein, which is a key indicator of potential pathogenicity. However, neither variant has sufficient information on the use of variant controls or direct OddsPath calculation. As a result, both variants receive a PS3_supporting rating.

Note: The ACMG guidelines and interpretations may vary depending on the specific context and requirements. These results should be used as a reference point rather than a definitive answer.
