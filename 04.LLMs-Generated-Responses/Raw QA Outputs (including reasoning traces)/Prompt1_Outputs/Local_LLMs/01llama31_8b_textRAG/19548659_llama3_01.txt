Based on the provided scientific paper text, I will extract relevant functional evidence details for each variant mentioned that has functional data.

**Variant 1:** A30P

* Gene: R-synuclein
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: A
	+ alt: P
	+ position: 30
* Variant String ID: R-synuclein A30P

Functional Evidence Assessment for A30P:

1. Define the disease mechanism.
	* Extracted Paper Info: The Cu(II)-R-synuclein interaction has been invoked as an important process in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant, which is related to Cu(II) binding to R-synuclein and its role in Parkinson’s disease.
2. Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.
	* Extracted Paper Info: Cu(II) binds to all three R-synuclein proteins with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and the Cu(II) binding constants vary among the proteins studied.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The general class of assay used for this variant (Cu(II) binding assay) effectively models or reflects the disease pathogenesis/mechanism defined in Step 1.
3. Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays (Basic Controls and Replicates).
	* Extracted Paper Info: Size exclusion analysis ruled out the contribution of protoﬁbrils to the strong Cu(II) binding.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper explicitly states that basic controls were included for this assay, specifically wild-type R-synuclein protein as a control, and multiple replicates were used for the experiments (size exclusion analysis).
4. Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation (Statistical Analyses).
	* Extracted Paper Info: Cu(II) binding constants were calculated for A30P.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The statistical analyses in the paper are sufficient to estimate or calculate OddsPath for the functional data for this variant.

Final Evidence Strength:

* Type: Pathogenic
* Strength: PS3_moderate

Overall Conclusion:
The Cu(II) binding assay demonstrates a moderate level of pathogenicity for the A30P variant, indicating that it has a lower affinity for Cu(II) compared to wild-type R-synuclein and A53T.

**Variant 2:** A53T

* Gene: R-synuclein
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: A
	+ alt: T
	+ position: 53
* Variant String ID: R-synuclein A53T

Functional Evidence Assessment for A53T:

1. Define the disease mechanism.
	* Extracted Paper Info: The Cu(II)-R-synuclein interaction has been invoked as an important process in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant, which is related to Cu(II) binding to R-synuclein and its role in Parkinson’s disease.

	* Judgment: Yes

Final Evidence Strength:

* Type: Pathogenic
* Strength: PS3_supporting

Overall Conclusion:
The Cu(II) binding assay demonstrates a supporting level of pathogenicity for the A53T variant, indicating that it has a moderate affinity for Cu(II) compared to wild-type R-synuclein.

**Variant 3:** Wild-Type (WT)

* Gene: R-synuclein
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: None
	+ alt: None
	+ position: N/A
* Variant String ID: R-synuclein WT

Functional Evidence Assessment for WT:

1. Define the disease mechanism.
	* Extracted Paper Info: The Cu(II)-R-synuclein interaction has been invoked as an important process in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant, which is related to Cu(II) binding to R-synuclein and its role in Parkinson’s disease.
2. Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.

	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The general class of assay used for this variant (Cu(II) binding assay) effectively models or reflects the disease pathogenesis/mechanism defined in Step 1.

Final Evidence Strength:

* Type: Neutral
* Strength: N/A

Overall Conclusion:
The Cu(II) binding assay does not provide any evidence for or against the WT variant, as it serves as a control in the study.
