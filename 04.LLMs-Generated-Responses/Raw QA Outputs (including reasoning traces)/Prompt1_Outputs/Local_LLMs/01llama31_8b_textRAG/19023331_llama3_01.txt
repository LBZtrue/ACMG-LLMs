Based on the provided scientific paper, I will extract relevant functional evidence details for each variant mentioned that has functional data.

**Variant 1: M26I in DJ-1**
* Gene: DJ-1
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: M
	+ alt: I
	+ position: 26
* Variant String ID: DJ-1 M26I

Functional Evidence Assessment:

* Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.
	+ The paper states that mutations in PARK7 DJ-1 have been associated with autosomal-recessive early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). This suggests a link between DJ-1 function and PD pathogenesis.
	+ Judgment: Yes
	+ Reasoning: The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant.
* Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.
	+ The paper uses yeast two-hybrid screening, which is a valid method for studying protein interactions and can be relevant to understanding DJ-1 function in PD.
	+ Judgment: Yes
	+ Reasoning: The general class of assay used effectively models or reflects the disease pathogenesis/mechanism defined in Step 1.
* Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.
	+ Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates.
		- The paper does not mention basic controls or replicates for this assay.
		- Judgment: No
		- Reasoning: The paper does not explicitly state that both "Normal/Negative/Wild type" **AND** "Abnormal/Positive/Null" controls were used, nor does it mention experimental repetition.
	+ Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay (if basic controls/replicates were insufficient).
		- The yeast two-hybrid screening is a widely accepted method for studying protein interactions and has been previously validated in other studies.
		- Judgment: Yes
		- Reasoning: The specific instance of the assay has been broadly accepted historically and/or previously validated in other studies.
* Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation.
	+ Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses.
		- The paper does not provide statistical analyses for this assay.
		- Judgment: No
		- Reasoning: The statistical analyses in the paper are insufficient to estimate or calculate OddsPath for the functional data for this variant.

Final Evidence Strength:

* Type: Pathogenic
* Strength: N/A

**Variant 2: L166P in DJ-1**
