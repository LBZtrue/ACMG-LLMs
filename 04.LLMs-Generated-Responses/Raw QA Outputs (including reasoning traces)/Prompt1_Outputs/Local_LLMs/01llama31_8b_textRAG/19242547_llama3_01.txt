**Note:**
- In this case, we have not identified specific point mutations for PINK1 but rather a functional impairment.
- The extracted information follows the specified format, including fields like "variant_id", "functional_evidence_aim", and "final_evidence_strength".
- Please note that some steps or sub-steps may not be applicable to every variant due to differences in the experimental setup, assay types, or the nature of the functional data presented. The ACMG flowchart logic is applied as per the internal decision rules specified for each step.
- For a complete and accurate assessment, please refer to the original paper's context and details as needed to ensure that all relevant information is considered in the analysis.
