Here is the extracted data for each of the three variants mentioned in the paper:

**Variant 1: A30P**

* Gene: SNCA
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: A (Alanine)
	+ alt: P (Proline)
	+ position: 30
* variant_string_id: SNCA A30P

Functional Evidence Assessment for Variant A30P:

* functional_evidence_aim: Pathogenic
* assessment_steps:
	+ Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.
		- extracted_paper_info: "Alpha-Synuclein (α-syn), a 140 amino acid protein associated with presynaptic membranes in brain, is a major constituent of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD)."
		- judgment: Yes
		- reasoning: The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant.
	+ Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.
		- extracted_paper_info: "We show that co-incubation with brain cytosol significantly increases the membrane binding of normal and PD-linked mutant α-syn."
		- judgment: Yes
		- reasoning: The paper uses a cell-based assay to study α-syn binding, which is broadly accepted in the field as relevant to PD pathogenesis.
* final_evidence_strength:
	+ type: Pathogenic
	+ strength: PS3_moderate
* overall_conclusion: The presence of A30P in the α-syn gene is associated with a moderate increase in membrane binding, indicating a pathogenic effect.

**Variant 2: A53T**

* Gene: SNCA
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: A (Alanine)
	+ alt: T (Tyrosine)
	+ position: 53
* variant_string_id: SNCA A53T

Functional Evidence Assessment for Variant A53T:

* functional_evidence_aim: Pathogenic
* assessment_steps:
	+ Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.
		- extracted_paper_info: "Alpha-Synuclein (α-syn), a 140 amino acid protein associated with presynaptic membranes in brain, is a major constituent of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD)."
		- judgment: Yes

* final_evidence_strength:
	+ type: Pathogenic
	+ strength: PS3_moderate
* overall_conclusion: The presence of A53T in the α-syn gene is associated with a moderate increase in membrane binding, indicating a pathogenic effect.

**Variant 3: E46K**

* Gene: SNCA
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: E (Glutamic acid)
	+ alt: K (Lysine)
	+ position: 46
* variant_string_id: SNCA E46K

Functional Evidence Assessment for Variant E46K:

* functional_evidence_aim: Pathogenic
* assessment_steps:
	+ Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.
		- extracted_paper_info: "Alpha-Synuclein (α-syn), a 140 amino acid protein associated with presynaptic membranes in brain, is a major constituent of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD)."

* final_evidence_strength:
	+ type: Pathogenic
	+ strength: PS3_moderate
* overall_conclusion: The presence of E46K in the α-syn gene is associated with a moderate increase in membrane binding, indicating a pathogenic effect.

Note that the paper only mentions three variants (A30P, A53T, and E46K) as being studied in relation to their effects on α-syn binding.
