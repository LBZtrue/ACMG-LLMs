Based on the provided text, I will follow the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart to determine the strength of the functional evidence for each variant mentioned.

**Variant 1:** UCH-L1 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase)

* **Extracted Information:** UCH-L1 is a gene product involved in protein degradation. Its mutations cause autosomal dominant familial Parkinson disease.
* **Parsed Variant Identification:**
	+ Gene: UCH-L1
	+ Protein Change: "unknown" (no specific amino acid change mentioned)
	+ Variant String ID: UCH-L1 unknown variant
* **Step 1:** Define the disease mechanism. The paper states that UCH-L1 is involved in protein degradation, which is relevant to Parkinson disease.
* **Judgment:** Yes
* **Reasoning:** The extracted information supports a link between UCH-L1 and Parkinson disease.

**Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates**

* **Extracted Information:** The paper mentions that experiments were performed in triplicate, but it does not specify whether basic controls (normal/negative/wild-type and abnormal/positive/null) were used.
* **Judgment:** No
* **Reasoning:** While the study had multiple replicates, it is unclear if basic controls were included.

**Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay**

* **Extracted Information:** UCH-L1 is a broadly accepted gene in the field of Parkinson disease research.
* **Judgment:** Yes
* **Reasoning:** The extracted information indicates that UCH-L1 has been extensively studied and validated.

**Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses**

* **Extracted Information:** The paper does not provide specific statistical analyses for this variant.
* **Judgment:** No
* **Reasoning:** The study lacks sufficient statistical analysis to estimate or calculate OddsPath for UCH-L1.

**Final Evidence Strength:** Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting

The final answer is:
