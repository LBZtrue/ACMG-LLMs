Note that this is a simplified example and actual ACMG guidelines may be more complex or nuanced.

**Genetic Variants**

* **PINK1 G309D**
	+ Gene: PINK1
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: R
		- alt: G
		- position: 309
	+ variant_string_id: PINK1 R309G
* **PINK1 L347P**
	+ Gene: PINK1
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: L
		- alt: P
		- position: 347
	+ variant_string_id: PINK1 L347P
* **PINK1 W437X**
	+ Gene: PINK1
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: W
		- alt: X
		- position: 437
	+ variant_string_id: PINK1 W437X

Please note that the protein changes for these variants are based on a simplified example and actual analysis may require more detailed information.

**TRAP1**

* **TRAP1**
	+ Gene: TRAP1
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: None
		- alt: None
		- position: None
	+ variant_string_id: None

Note that TRAP1 is a protein and does not have a specific genetic variant associated with it in this example.
