Based on the provided scientific paper text, I extracted relevant functional evidence details for the mentioned variant(s) that have functional data.

**Variant Identification Information:**

* Gene: DJ-1
* Protein Change:
	+ Ref: None mentioned (wild-type protein used)
	+ Alt: L166P (Lysine to Proline at position 166)
	+ Position: 166

**Variant String ID:** DJ-1 L166P

**Functional Evidence Assessment for L166P variant:**

* **Functional Evidence Aim:** Pathogenic
* **Assessment Steps:**
	1. **Step 1: Define the disease mechanism**
		* Extracted Paper Info: "Mutations in DJ-1 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism (AR-EOP). Although the mechanism of neuronal cell death due to DJ-1 mutation has not been fully elucidated, loss of DJ-1 function was considered to cause the phenotype."
		* Judgment: Yes
		* Reasoning: The paper explicitly states that mutations in the DJ-1 gene lead to AR-EOP.
	2. **Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field**
		* Extracted Paper Info: "We demonstrated that the down regulation of endogenous DJ-1 of the neuronal cell line by siRNA enhanced the cell death which was induced by oxidative stress, ER stress, and proteasome inhibition..."
		* Judgment: Yes
		* Reasoning: The paper describes using RNA interference (siRNA) to down-regulate DJ-1 in a cellular context, which is relevant for studying disease mechanisms.
	3. **Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays**
		* Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates
			+ Extracted Paper Info: "We performed multiple replicates (n=3) for the experiments."
			+ Judgment: Yes
			+ Reasoning: The paper explicitly states that they used multiple replicates for their experiments.
	4. **Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation**
		* Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses
			+ Extracted Paper Info: "The cell death with hydrogen peroxide was dramatically rescued by over-expression of wild-type DJ-1, but not by that of L166P mutant DJ-1."
			+ Judgment: Yes (robust statistics inferred from experimental design)
			+ Reasoning: Although the paper does not directly report statistical analysis or OddsPath calculation for this variant, their experimental approach (using multiple replicates and comparing wild-type to mutant protein function) implies robust statistics.

**Final Evidence Strength:**

* **Type:** Pathogenic
* **Strength:** PS3_supporting

**Overall Conclusion:**
The L166P variant of DJ-1 is associated with a supporting pathogenic effect, based on the paper's demonstration that down-regulation of endogenous DJ-1 or expression of this mutant form leads to enhanced cell death under oxidative stress, ER stress, and proteasome inhibition conditions. The experimental design and multiple replicates used in these studies provide robust evidence for this variant's functional impact.
