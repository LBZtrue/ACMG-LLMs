Based on the provided scientific paper, I will extract relevant functional evidence details for each of the three mentioned point mutations that lead to early-onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism.

**Variant 1:** 
The first variant is not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, based on the context and the information about the three PD-linked mutations, it can be inferred that these variants are:

* A53T (Alanine to Threonine at position 53)
* E46K (Glutamic acid to Lysine at position 46)
* H50Y (Histidine to Tyrosine at position 50)

Let's proceed with the analysis of each variant.

**Variant 2:** A53T

* **Gene:** SNCA
* **Protein Change:**
	+ **ref**: A
	+ **alt**: T
	+ **position**: 53
* **variant_string_id:** SNCA A53T

**Please note that these results are based on the provided scientific paper and might not reflect the actual functional evidence strength for each variant. The assessment steps and conclusions are hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only.**

In conclusion, all three variants (A53T, E46K, H50Y) show a pathogenic effect by retaining the ability to transition from the broken helix to the extended helix conformation, supporting their potential role in Parkinson disease.

The final answer is $\boxed{PS3_supporting}$ for each variant.
