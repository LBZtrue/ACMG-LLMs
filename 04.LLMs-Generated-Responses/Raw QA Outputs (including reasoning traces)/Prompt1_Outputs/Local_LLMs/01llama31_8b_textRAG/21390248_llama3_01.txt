This output reflects the assessment of each mutation's functional evidence strength according to the provided ACMG guidelines. Each variant has a specific `final_evidence_strength` based on the calculated OddsPath value or inferred from the experimental results and statistical analyses. The overall conclusions for each mutation are also included, summarizing how they may lead to pathogenic effects due to their impact on LRRK2's function.
