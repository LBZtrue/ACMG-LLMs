Note: The "Protein_Change" field for this variant is empty because it was not specified in the paper. The final evidence strength assigned to this variant is PS3_supporting due to the following reasons:

*   The kinase activity assay used in the study models the disease mechanism defined in Step 1 (YES).
*   Basic controls were not explicitly mentioned, but the assay was previously validated (YES).
*   No OddsPath calculation was performed (Sub-step 4b), which limits the strength of the evidence to PS3_supporting.
