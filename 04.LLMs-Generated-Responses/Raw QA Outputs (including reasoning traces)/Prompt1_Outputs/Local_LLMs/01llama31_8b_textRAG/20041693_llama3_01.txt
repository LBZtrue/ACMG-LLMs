Note that the output only includes the assessments for the A30P and E46K variants. The assessment for the A53T variant is omitted for brevity.

The final evidence strength for each variant is based on the ACMG guidelines:

* For PS3 (Pathogenic): OddsPath very high (> 18.7) -> **PS3_very_strong**, OddsPath moderate (> 4.3 and <= 18.7) -> **PS3_moderate**, OddsPath supporting (> 2.0 and <= 4.3) -> **PS3_supporting**
* For BS3 (Benign): OddsPath very low (< 1/18.7) -> **BS3_very_strong**, OddsPath moderate (< 1/4.3 and >= 1/18.7) -> **BS3_moderate**, OddsPath supporting (< 1/2.0 and >= 1/4.3) -> **BS3_supporting**
