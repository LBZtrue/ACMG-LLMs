This output represents two variants (LRRK2 R1699H and LRRK2 G2019S) from the specified study, along with their corresponding functional evidence assessment results. Each variant's final evidence strength is determined based on the ACMG guidelines for functional assay interpretation. The overall conclusion section provides a summary of the association between each variant and parkinsonian symptoms.
