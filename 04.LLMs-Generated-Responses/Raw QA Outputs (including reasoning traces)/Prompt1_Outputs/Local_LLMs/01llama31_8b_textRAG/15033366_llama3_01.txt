This assessment concludes that the deletion of residues 56–102 (exon 4) and the insertion of methionine (M) at position 53 in a-synuclein have strong evidence supporting their pathogenicity. The OddsPath values are high, indicating that these variants significantly contribute to the disease mechanism.
