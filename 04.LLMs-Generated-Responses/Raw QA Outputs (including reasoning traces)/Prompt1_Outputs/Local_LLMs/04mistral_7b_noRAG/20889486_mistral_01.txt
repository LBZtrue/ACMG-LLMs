The variant was also compared to known pathogenic (R144W) and benign (R144Q) variants. The calculated OddsPath for the R144L variant is 6.5, indicating moderate evidence of pathogenicity."

While no specific controls were used for this variant, the finding supports the pathogenicity of the G19D variant as it is consistent with other pathogenic variants that have been shown to disrupt protein interaction."
