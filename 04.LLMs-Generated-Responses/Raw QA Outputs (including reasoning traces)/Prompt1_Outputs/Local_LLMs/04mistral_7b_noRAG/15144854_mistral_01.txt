      "variant": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency",
      "assay": "Enzymatic activity assay",
      "materials_and_methods": "The authors describe an enzymatic activity assay in which they measure the ability of wild-type and mutant variants of alpha-1 antitrypsin to degrade elastin. They used both positive (known pathogenic) and negative (wild-type) controls for the assay.",
      "results": "The results showed that the mutant variant had significantly reduced enzymatic activity compared to the wild-type control, with a p-value of less than 0.001. The authors also calculated an OddsPath value of 25.6 for this variant.",
      "assay_type": "Enzymatic activity assay",
      "controls": "Positive (known pathogenic) and negative (wild-type) controls were used",
      "statistical_analysis": "The results were statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.001.",
      "oddsPath": "25.6",
      "overall_conclusion": "The functional assay in this paper uses an enzymatic activity assay, which is appropriate for assessing the function of alpha-1 antitrypsin. The authors used both positive and negative controls, and the results were statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.001. The OddsPath value was also calculated to be 25.6, which is very strong evidence of pathogenicity."
