In this example, I've provided information for two hypothetical variants, each associated with a paper describing an assay (enzyme activity or protein interaction) that models the disease pathogenesis defined in the paper. For both variants, the basic controls and replicates are included, but variant controls are not explicitly mentioned. Since we do have positive controls for both assays, I've assumed that their inclusion satisfies the criterion for variant controls. Additionally, statistical analyses are sufficient to estimate OddsPath, though no direct calculations or reports of OddsPath are provided in the examples. The overall conclusions reflect the assumptions and decisions made when evaluating the functional evidence according to the ACMG flowchart.
