This JSON represents three examples of extracted data from papers that describe functional assays relevant to genetic diseases. Each entry contains the variant tested (not specified in the provided context), the paper title (also not specified), the final evidence strength, and an overall conclusion summarizing why the assigned strength was given based on the key findings from the paper. The evidence strength is categorized as either Pathogenic (PS3) or Benign (BS3) with varying levels of confidence: very_strong, moderate, or supporting. The overall conclusion provides a brief summary of the reasons behind the assigned evidence strength.
