    "variant": "Wild type",
    "assay": "Cell phenotype rescue assay",
    "materials_and_methods": "The study used a cell phenotype rescue assay to evaluate the function of the wild type protein compared to known loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants. The experiments were performed in triplicate, using both wild type and loss-of-function proteins as controls.",
    "results": "The results showed that the wild type protein rescued the cell phenotype caused by the loss-of-function mutant, whereas the gain-of-function mutant did not. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the mean phenotypic scores between groups, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.",
    "evidence_strength": {
      "type": "N/A",
      "strength": "N/A"
    },
    "overall_conclusion": "The wild type protein was used as a control in a cell phenotype rescue assay, which is a general class of assay that effectively models the disease pathogenesis (Step 2). The experiments were performed in triplicate and included both wild type and loss-of-function proteins as controls (Sub-step 3c). Statistical analyses were performed, but no OddsPath value was reported. Since there is no way to infer the strength of evidence from the provided information, no PS3 or BS3 rating can be assigned."

    "variant": "Mutant A",
    "assay": "Enzyme activity assay",
    "materials_and_methods": "The study used an enzyme activity assay to evaluate the function of Mutant A compared to wild type and another known loss-of-function mutant. The experiment was performed in triplicate, using both wild type and loss-of-function proteins as controls.",
    "results": "The results showed that Mutant A had reduced enzyme activity compared to the wild type protein. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the mean enzymatic activity between groups, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.",
    "evidence_strength": {
      "type": "Pathogenic",
      "strength": "PS3_supporting"
    },
    "overall_conclusion": "Mutant A was used in an enzyme activity assay, which is a general class of assay that effectively models the disease pathogenesis (Step 2). The experiment was performed in triplicate and included both wild type and loss-of-function proteins as controls (Sub-step 3c). Statistical analyses were performed, and the results showed reduced enzyme activity for Mutant A compared to wild type. Although no OddsPath value was reported, the reduced enzymatic activity is consistent with a pathogenic effect, which gives PS3_supporting evidence."

  {
    "variant": "Mutant B",
    "assay": "Protein interaction assay",
    "materials_and_methods": "The study used a protein interaction assay to evaluate the function of Mutant B compared to wild type. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and no additional controls were mentioned.",
    "results": "The results showed that Mutant B did not interact with the target protein as efficiently as the wild type protein. No statistical analyses were reported.",
    "evidence_strength": {
      "type": "Pathogenic",
      "strength": "Max PS3_supporting"
    },
    "overall_conclusion": "Mutant B was used in a protein interaction assay, which is a general class of assay that effectively models the disease pathogenesis (Step 2). However, no additional controls were mentioned during the experiment. The results showed that Mutant B did not interact with the target protein as efficiently as wild type. Since there were no statistical analyses or sufficient control proteins to assess the evidence strength, the functional evidence for this variant is Max PS3_supporting."
