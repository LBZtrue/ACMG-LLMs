The assay includes both wild-type control and known loss-of-function mutant, with multiple replicates. Statistical analyses were performed, and a p-value and effect size were provided. The variant controls include the known loss-of-function mutant used as a positive control. The OddsPath for this variant was calculated to be 10.5, which is considered very strong evidence of pathogenicity."
