Explanation: The USP36 gene mutation results from a protein interaction assay which shows a significant loss of interaction with key protein partners (Step 1 and 2). Basic controls and replicates were used, and the specific instance of the assay has been previously validated (Sub-step 3a). Variant controls were also used (Sub-step 3c), and statistical analyses were sufficient to calculate OddsPath (Sub-step 4a). The calculated OddsPath was very high, providing PS3_very_strong evidence for pathogenicity.

The AP2M1 gene mutation results from a cell phenotype rescue assay which shows a partial loss of function and rescue of cellular defects upon re-expression (Step 1 and 2). Basic controls and replicates were used, and the specific instance of the assay has been previously validated. Variant controls were not explicitly mentioned, but there were at least 11 total benign/pathogenic variant controls across the entire study (Sub-step 4b). The calculated OddsPath was moderate, providing PS3_moderate evidence for pathogenicity.

The AP2M3B gene mutation results from an enzyme activity assay which demonstrates a moderate decrease in enzymatic activity compared to wild type (Step 1 and 2). Basic controls and replicates were used, but the specific instance of the assay has not been previously validated. Variant controls were not explicitly mentioned, but there were at least 11 total benign/pathogenic variant controls across the entire study. Statistical analyses were sufficient to infer the OddsPath, which was supporting, providing PS3_supporting evidence for pathogenicity.
