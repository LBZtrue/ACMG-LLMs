Statistical analysis was performed on the results, showing significant differences between the wild-type and mutated proteins.",

The assay is broadly accepted in the field and includes normal and abnormal controls, replicates, and statistical analysis. However, no variant controls were used. Given the significant reduction in enzyme activity (oddsPath = 12.5), the functional evidence strength for this variant is PS3_moderate."

The protein interaction between the wild-type protein and its binding partner was used as a control for the mutant protein. Statistical analysis was not performed on the results due to the qualitative nature of the data.",

      "overall_conclusion": "Based on the protein interaction assay, the P0002 variant has a significant reduction in its ability to interact with binding partners compared to the wild-type protein. The assay is previously validated in other studies and includes normal controls and replicates. However, no variant controls or statistical analysis were used. Given the significant reduction in protein interaction, the functional evidence strength for this variant is Max PS3_supporting."
