      "overall_conclusion": "The null mutant of Protein X did not interact with its binding partner, Protein Y, which is a critical function for this protein. This functional assay (protein interaction) effectively models the disease pathogenesis (disruption of protein-protein interactions). The assay used proper controls and replicates, and variant controls were also included. The statistical analyses provided in the paper allow us to calculate an OddsPath value > 18.7, which falls under the PS3_very_strong category."
