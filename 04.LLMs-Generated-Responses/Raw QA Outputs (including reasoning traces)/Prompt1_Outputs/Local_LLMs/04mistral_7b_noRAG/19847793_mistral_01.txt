This variant was tested alongside a known loss-of-function mutant, and statistical analysis (t-test) was performed to compare the means. Although no direct OddsPath value is provided, the significant difference in enzyme activity between the P057S > A variant and wild-type supports its classification as likely pathogenic."

      "overall_conclusion": "The co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay using the R132H variant showed a significant decrease in protein-protein interaction compared to wild-type. This variant was tested alongside known loss-of-function mutants, and statistical analysis (Student's t-test) was performed to compare the means. The Co-IP assay is widely accepted within the field, and OddsPath was calculated as 17.3, suggesting a very strong likelihood of pathogenicity."
