      "overall_conclusion": "This functional evidence is from a cell phenotype rescue assay, which effectively models the disease pathogenesis defined in the paper. The study used both wild-type and loss-of-function controls, performed multiple replicates, and explicitly validated the assay in previous studies. Additionally, known pathogenic variants were used as controls for this variant. Statistical analyses were conducted, and a significant effect (OddsPath > 18.7) was observed on the function of the protein associated with the variant."

      "overall_conclusion": "This functional evidence is from a protein interaction assay, which effectively models the disease pathogenesis defined in the paper. The study used both wild-type and known gain-of-function mutant controls, performed multiple replicates, but did not explicitly validate the assay in previous studies or provide commercial kit information. Additionally, no direct statistical analyses were conducted to calculate OddsPath for this variant; however, at least 11 total pathogenic/benign variant controls were used across the entire study."

The study used both wild-type and known loss-of-function mutant controls, but did not perform multiple replicates or explicitly validate the assay in previous studies or provide commercial kit information. Additionally, no direct statistical analyses were conducted to calculate OddsPath for this variant; however, only 8 total pathogenic/benign variant controls were used across the entire study."
