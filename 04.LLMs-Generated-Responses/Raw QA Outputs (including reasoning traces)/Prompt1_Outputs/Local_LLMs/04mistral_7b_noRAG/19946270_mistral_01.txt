The assay used measures cellular phenotypes (e.g., colony formation) resulting from the overexpression or knockdown of the wild-type and mutant proteins in relevant cell lines.",

The paper provides evidence for the use of this general class of assay, as it shows a clear link between loss-of-function mutations in the gene of interest and aberrant cellular phenotypes.",

However, further functional and genetic analyses would help strengthen the evidence."
