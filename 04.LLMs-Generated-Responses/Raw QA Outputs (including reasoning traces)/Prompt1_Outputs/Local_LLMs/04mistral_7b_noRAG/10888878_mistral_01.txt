      "paper_link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/XXX",
      "assay_type": "Enzyme Activity Assay",
      "controls_used": ["Wild type protein", "Empty vector", "Known loss-of-function mutant", "Known gain-of-function mutant"],
      "replicates_used": true,
      "statistical_analysis": true,
      "odds_path": 19.5,
      "overall_conclusion": "The Ala585Val mutation shows a strong loss of enzyme activity, as demonstrated by the significant decrease in activity compared to wild type protein (p<0.001) and the observed increase in activity with known gain-of-function mutant (p<0.001). The OddsPath of 19.5 indicates a very strong pathogenic effect."

      "statistical_analysis": false,
      "total_controls": 12,
      "overall_conclusion": "The Glu762Lys mutation shows a significant decrease in protein interactions compared to wild type protein (n=3 independent experiments, p<0.01). Although statistical analysis was not performed, the use of 12 total controls (8 pathogenic and 4 benign) supports a moderate pathogenic effect."

      "statistical_analysis": false,
      "total_controls": 4,
      "overall_conclusion": "The Arg939Gln mutation shows a partial rescue of cell phenotype compared to wild type protein in cells expressing the mutant protein (n=3 independent experiments). However, without statistical analysis or more controls, it is difficult to determine the functional significance of this variant."
