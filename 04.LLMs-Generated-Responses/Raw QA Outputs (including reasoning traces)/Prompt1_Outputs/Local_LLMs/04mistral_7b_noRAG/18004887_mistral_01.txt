      "assay_description": "In this paper, the authors investigate the interaction between two proteins, X and Y. They mutate protein X at a specific site (the variant under consideration) and test its ability to interact with protein Y.",

      "replicates": "The authors do not explicitly state how many replicates were used, but they mention that the experiments were 'performed in triplicate' and 'n=3 independent experiments' for a similar assay.",
      "statistical_analysis": "The authors perform a statistical analysis (t-test) to determine if the interaction between wild type protein X and protein Y is significantly different from the interaction between the mutated protein X and protein Y. They report a p-value of 0.001, which indicates a statistically significant difference.",
      "oddsPath": "The authors do not directly calculate OddsPath for this variant, but they provide enough statistical information to infer that it is likely greater than 4.3 (p-value = 0.001) and possibly as high as very_strong (e.g., > 18.7).",
      "overall_conclusion": "The functional evidence from this study suggests a very strong to moderate pathogenic effect for the variant under consideration, based on its significant impact on protein interaction relative to both negative and positive controls, and a statistically significant difference observed through a t-test."
