Here is the information extracted from each paper for the functional evidence evaluation according to the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart:

Paper 1:
```json
{
  "variant": "Paper 1",
  "functional_evidence_strength": {
    "type": "Pathogenic",
    "strength": "PS3_very_strong"
  },
  "overall_conclusion": "The study uses a well-accepted, replicated gene expression assay to show that the variant causes increased gene expression, with multiple known pathogenic variants used as controls. The results also include OddsPath calculations for this specific variant."
},
```

Paper 2:
```json
{
  "variant": "Paper 2",
  "functional_evidence_strength": {
    "type": "Benign",
    "strength": "BS3_very_strong"
  },
  "overall_conclusion": "The study uses a well-accepted, replicated enzyme activity assay to show that the variant has normal enzymatic activity compared to wild type. The results also include multiple known benign variants as controls."
},
```

Paper 3:
```json
{
  "variant": "Paper 3",
  "functional_evidence_strength": {
    "type": "Pathogenic",
    "strength": "PS3_moderate"
  },
  "overall_conclusion": "The study uses a novel cell phenotype rescue assay to show that the variant causes abnormal cell behavior. Although this is a new technique, it has been validated in other studies. OddsPath calculations for this specific variant were not provided, but multiple known pathogenic variants and 12 total control variants (6 benign/6 pathogenic) were used."
