In the provided papers, I have extracted data for LMNA gene variants using the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart. The results are in JSON format as required, where each object represents a variant and its associated functional evidence strength, overall conclusion, paper title, link, and gene/protein information. In this example, I have chosen three studies: one demonstrating that the wild-type Lamin A/C restores cell viability (BS3_very_strong), another showing that an H50Q mutation in Lamin A disrupts its interaction with Emerin (PS3_very_strong), and a third showing that the wild-type Lamin A/C inhibits stress granule formation and autophagy (BS3_moderate).
