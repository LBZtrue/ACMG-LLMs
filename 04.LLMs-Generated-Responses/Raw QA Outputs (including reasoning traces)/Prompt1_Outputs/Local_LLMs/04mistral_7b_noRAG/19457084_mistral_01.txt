The specific instance of the assay has been accepted historically, and the variant controls used were known pathogenic variants. The study includes robust statistical analyses, leading to an OddsPath value greater than 18.7, which is considered a very strong piece of functional evidence supporting the pathogenicity of this variant."

The specific instance of the assay has been accepted historically, and the variant controls used were known benign variants. The study includes robust statistical analyses, leading to an OddsPath value less than 1/18.7, which is considered a very strong piece of functional evidence supporting the benign nature of this variant."
