      "variant_symbol": "PINK1",
      "variant_allele": "c.583C>T",
      "assay_type": "Protein Interaction Assay",
      "assay_description": "The study tested the interaction between PINK1 and Parkin proteins in response to oxidative stress.",
      "materials_and_methods_excerpt": "Materials: HEK293 cells, plasmids expressing wild-type PINK1, Parkin, and mutant forms of PINK1 (including c.583C>T).\nMethods: Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to assess the interaction between PINK1 and Parkin proteins under oxidative stress conditions.",
      "results_excerpt": "Results: The c.583C>T mutant form of PINK1 did not interact with Parkin protein under oxidative stress, whereas wild-type PINK1 did.\nControl experiments were performed using empty vector and known loss-of-function mutant for PINK1.",
      "controls_used": ["Empty Vector", "Known Loss-of-Function Mutant"],
      "statistical_analysis_excerpt": "Statistical analysis: Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in triplicate, and a significant decrease in interaction was observed for the c.583C>T mutant compared to wild-type PINK1.",
      "oddsPath": null,
      "assay_novelty": false,
      "validation": true,
      "overall_conclusion": "The assay used in this study is a validated and accepted protein interaction assay. The c.583C>T variant of PINK1 was tested under conditions that reproduced the known molecular basis for the disease (interaction between PINK1 and Parkin proteins), and statistical analysis suggests a significant decrease in interaction for the mutant form compared to wild-type. This supports the interpretation that this variant is likely pathogenic."
