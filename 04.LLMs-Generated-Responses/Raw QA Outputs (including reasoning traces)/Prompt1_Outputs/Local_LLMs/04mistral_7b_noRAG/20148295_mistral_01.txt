Explanation:

1. Wild-type does not have a mutation, so it cannot be tested through the protein aggregation assay. The functional evidence is not applicable for this variant.

2. Alpha-Synuclein A53T shows an increased rate of protein aggregation compared to wild-type and was previously validated in other studies. Multiple replicates were used, and known pathogenic variants were used as controls. The functional evidence strength for this variant is PS3_very_strong.

3. Alpha-Synuclein A30P shows a slower rate of protein aggregation compared to wild-type and was previously validated in other studies. Multiple replicates were used, and known benign variants were used as controls. The functional evidence strength for this variant is BS3_supporting.
