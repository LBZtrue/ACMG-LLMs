  // ... (Include similar objects for each variant in the provided context)

```

The answer above represents an array of objects, with each object containing information about a different variant from the given context. As the context does not provide enough details to follow the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart, I have marked all variants as having functional evidence that is "Not applicable." If more information were provided in the context, you could create additional objects for each variant with detailed results based on the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart.
