      "overall_conclusion": "The p.Gly137Arg variant in Ferritin was found to cause iron overload in Drosophila melanogaster and was shown to disrupt the protein's function via a cell phenotype rescue assay, which is a well-established technique for studying gene function in this model organism. The assay included both wild-type and mutant controls, as well as statistical analysis of the data, resulting in an OddsPath value > 18.7."
