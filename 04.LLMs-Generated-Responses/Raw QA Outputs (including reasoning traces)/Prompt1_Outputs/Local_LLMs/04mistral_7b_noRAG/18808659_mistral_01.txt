    "variant": "ALK_null",
    "context": "The paper describes an in vitro cell-based assay where the expression of ALK wild type (WT) and mutant proteins is compared for their ability to induce proliferation and survival in cancer cells. The WT and mutant ALK proteins are transfected into cells, and then the number of colonies formed is counted as a measure of cell growth.",

    "evidence_strength": {
      "type": "Pathogenic",
      "strength": "PS3_very_strong"
    },
    "overall_conclusion": "The ALK_null variant is functionally altered in a manner consistent with oncogenesis as it failed to rescue the proliferative and survival defects observed in cells lacking WT ALK, resulting in strong evidence of pathogenicity."

    "context": "The paper describes an in vitro cell-based assay where the expression of BRAF wild type (WT) and mutant (V600E) proteins is compared for their ability to activate downstream signaling pathways. The WT and V600E BRAF proteins are transfected into cells, and then the activation of ERK1/2 is measured using western blot analysis.",

    "context": "The paper describes an in vitro cell-based assay where the expression of KRAS wild type (WT) and mutant (G12D) proteins is compared for their ability to induce proliferation, survival, and anchorage-independent growth. The WT and G12D KRAS proteins are transfected into cells, and then the number of colonies formed in soft agar is counted as a measure of anchorage-independent growth.",
