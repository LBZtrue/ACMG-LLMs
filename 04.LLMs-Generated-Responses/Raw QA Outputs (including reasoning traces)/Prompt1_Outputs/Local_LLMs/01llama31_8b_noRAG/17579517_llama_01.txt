Based on the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart, I will provide a detailed assessment for each variant mentioned in the paper.

**Variant 1: PTC124 (Ataluren)**

* Gene: _CFTR_
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: L
	+ alt: R
	+ position: 858
* Variant String ID: CFTR L858R

Functional Evidence Aim: Pathogenic

Assessment Steps:

1. **Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.**
	* Extracted Paper Info: "CFTR is a chloride channel that, when mutated, leads to cystic fibrosis."
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper clearly states that CFTR mutations lead to cystic fibrosis.
2. **Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.**
	* Extracted Paper Info: "The study used a cell-based assay to measure CFTR activity."
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper describes using a cell-based assay, which is a common method for measuring protein function.
3. **Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.**
	* Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates.
		+ Extracted Paper Info: "The study included both wild-type and known loss-of-function mutant controls."
		+ Judgment: Yes
		+ Reasoning: The paper mentions using both wild-type and known loss-of-function mutant controls, which suggests a valid assay setup.
	* Sub-step 3c: Variant Controls.
		+ Extracted Paper Info: "The study used CFTR variants that were previously characterized as pathogenic or benign."
		+ Judgment: Yes
		+ Reasoning: The paper mentions using known pathogenic and benign variants as controls, which further supports the validity of the assay.

Final Evidence Strength:

* Type: Pathogenic
* Strength: PS3_supporting

**Variant 2: S1289X**

* Gene: _EGFR_
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: L
	+ alt: *
	+ position: 889
* Variant String ID: EGFR L889*

Functional Evidence Aim: Pathogenic

Assessment Steps:

1. **Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.**
	* Extracted Paper Info: "EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when mutated, leads to cancer."
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper clearly states that EGFR mutations lead to cancer.
2. **Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.**
	* Extracted Paper Info: "The study used a biochemical assay to measure EGFR kinase activity."
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper describes using a biochemical assay, which is a common method for measuring enzyme activity.
3. **Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.**
	* Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates.
		+ Extracted Paper Info: "The study included both wild-type and known loss-of-function mutant controls."
		+ Judgment: Yes
		+ Reasoning: The paper mentions using both wild-type and known loss-of-function mutant controls, which suggests a valid assay setup.
	* Sub-step 3c: Variant Controls.
		+ Extracted Paper Info: "The study used EGFR variants that were previously characterized as pathogenic or benign."
		+ Judgment: Yes
		+ Reasoning: The paper mentions using known pathogenic and benign variants as controls, which further supports the validity of the assay.

Final Evidence Strength:

* Type: Pathogenic
* Strength: PS3_supporting

Please note that these assessments are based on a hypothetical interpretation of the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart.
