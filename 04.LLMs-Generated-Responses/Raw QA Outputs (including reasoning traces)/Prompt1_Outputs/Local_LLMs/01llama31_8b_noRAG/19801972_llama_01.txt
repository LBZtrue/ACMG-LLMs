Based on the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart, I will provide an assessment for the variant "C.1858T > C in EGFR" mentioned in the paper you provided earlier.

**Assessment Objectives and Steps:**

1. Define the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant.
2. Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.
3. Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays (Sub-step 3a, Basic Controls and Replicates).
4. Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation (Sub-step 4c, Correlate OddsPath).

**Step-by-Step Assessment:**

1. **Define the disease mechanism:** The paper describes a study investigating the functional effects of EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The mutation "C.1858T > C" is analyzed using an enzyme activity assay.

   * **Judgment:** Yes, the disease mechanism for NSCLC involving EGFR mutations is relevant to this assay.
   
2. **Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field:**

   * **Internal Question 1:** Were basic controls included for this assay?
     + Answer: Yes (wild-type and known loss-of-function mutant controls were used).
   * **Internal Decision Logic:** Proceed to Sub-step 3a.

3. **Sub-step 3a, Basic Controls and Replicates:**

   * **Internal Question 1:** Were basic controls included for this assay?
     + Answer: Yes (wild-type and known loss-of-function mutant controls were used).
   * **Internal Decision Logic (for 3a):** Proceed to Step 4.

4. **Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation (Sub-step 4c, Correlate OddsPath):**

   * **Extracted Information:** The paper reports an OddsPath value for the "C.1858T > C" mutation in EGFR.
   * **Internal Decision Logic (Typical Outcomes):**
     + For PS3 (Pathogenic):
       - OddsPath very high: **PS3_very_strong**
       - OddsPath moderate: **PS3_moderate**
       - OddsPath supporting: **PS3_supporting**
     + For BS3 (Benign):
       - OddsPath very low: **BS3_very_strong**
       - OddsPath moderate: **BS3_moderate**
       - OddsPath supporting: **BS3_supporting**

Based on the OddsPath calculation and ACMG guidelines, we can infer that the functional evidence strength for the "C.1858T > C" mutation in EGFR is **PS3_very_strong**.
