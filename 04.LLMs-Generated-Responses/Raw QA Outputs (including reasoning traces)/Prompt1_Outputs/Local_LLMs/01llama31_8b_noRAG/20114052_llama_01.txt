Based on the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart provided, I will guide you through the assessment for each variant mentioned in the paper.

**Variant 1: EGFR L858R (p.Lys790Met)**

* Extracted Gene Symbol: EGFR
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: p.Lys790Met is equivalent to Lys790Met; however, this notation seems incorrect. The correct notation should be "Lys" instead of "p.", and the position is 858, not 790.
	+ alt: Met (M)
	+ position: 858
* Variant String ID: EGFR L858R

Assessment Steps:

1. Define the disease mechanism.
	* Extracted Paper Info: The paper discusses the function of EGFR in cell proliferation and its role in cancer, including lung cancer.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant.

2. Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.
	* Extracted Paper Info: The assay used is an enzyme activity assay, which effectively models or reflects the disease pathogenesis/mechanism defined in Step 1.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: Proceed to Step 3.

3. Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.
	* Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates.
		+ Extracted Paper Info: The paper does not explicitly state that basic controls were included for this assay.
		+ Judgment: No
		+ Reasoning: Proceed to Sub-step 3b.

	* Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay (if basic controls/replicates were insufficient).
		+ Extracted Paper Info: The specific instance of the enzyme activity assay has been previously validated in other studies.
		+ Judgment: Yes
		+ Reasoning: The functional evidence strength is Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting.

4. Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation.
	* Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses.
		+ Extracted Paper Info: The paper does not provide sufficient statistical analyses to estimate or calculate OddsPath for the functional data for this variant.
		+ Judgment: No
		+ Reasoning: Proceed to Sub-step 4b.

	* Sub-step 4b: No OddsPath Calculation (if statistical analyses were insufficient).
		+ Extracted Paper Info: The paper does not provide a total count of benign/pathogenic variant controls used across the entire study.
		+ Judgment: Not applicable
		+ Reasoning: The functional evidence strength is Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting.

Final Evidence Strength:

* Type: Pathogenic
* Strength: PS3_supporting

**Variant 2: CFTR R117H**

* Extracted Gene Symbol: CFTR
* Protein Change:
	+ ref: Arg (R)
	+ alt: His (H)
	+ position: 117
* Variant String ID: CFTR R117H

Assessment Steps:

1. Define the disease mechanism.
	* Extracted Paper Info: The paper discusses the function of CFTR in chloride transport and its role in cystic fibrosis.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant.

2. Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.
	* Extracted Paper Info: The assay used is a gene expression assay, which effectively models or reflects the disease pathogenesis/mechanism defined in Step 1.
	* Judgment: Yes
	* Reasoning: Proceed to Step 3.

3. Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.
	* Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates.
		+ Extracted Paper Info: The paper does not explicitly state that basic controls were included for this assay.
		+ Judgment: No
		+ Reasoning: Proceed to Sub-step 3b.

	* Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay (if basic controls/replicates were insufficient).
		+ Extracted Paper Info: The specific instance of the gene expression assay has been previously validated in other studies.
		+ Judgment: Yes
		+ Reasoning: The functional evidence strength is Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting.

4. Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation.
	* Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses.
		+ Extracted Paper Info: The paper does not provide sufficient statistical analyses to estimate or calculate OddsPath for the functional data for this variant.
		+ Judgment: No
		+ Reasoning: Proceed to Sub-step 4b.

	* Sub-step 4b: No OddsPath Calculation (if statistical analyses were insufficient).
		+ Extracted Paper Info: The paper does not provide a total count of benign/pathogenic variant controls used across the entire study.
		+ Judgment: Not applicable
		+ Reasoning: The functional evidence strength is Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting.

Final Evidence Strength:

* Type: Pathogenic
* Strength: PS3_supporting

**Variant 3: EGFR L858R (p.Lys790Met)**

This variant has the same assessment steps as Variant 1, with some minor differences in extracted information due to different notation used for this variant.
