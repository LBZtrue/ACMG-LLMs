Based on the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart, let's assess the variant `EGFR L858R` from the given paper.

**Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.**
The paper discusses a functional assay related to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is caused by mutations in the EGFR gene leading to oncogenic signaling.

**Judgment:** Yes

**Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.**
The paper uses an enzyme activity assay, which is a standard technique for studying protein function and has been previously validated as relevant to NSCLC pathogenesis.

**Judgment:** Yes

**Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.**

* **Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates.**
    The paper mentions using multiple replicates, but it does not provide explicit details on the types of controls used.
    
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Search "Materials and Methods" for descriptions of controls.
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 3a):** Since basic controls/replicates were insufficient in this sub-step, proceed to Sub-step 3b.

* **Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay.**
    The enzyme activity assay used is a standard technique and has been previously validated as relevant to NSCLC pathogenesis.
    
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Look for statements on assay novelty, references to prior validation, or mentions of commercial kits/standards.
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 3b):** The functional evidence strength is **Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting**.

* **Sub-step 3c: Variant Controls.**
    No variant controls were used in the assay for this variant.
    
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Identify lists of variants used as positive/negative controls and their stated classifications or known status.
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 3c):** The functional evidence strength is **Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting**.

**Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation.**

* **Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses.**
    No statistical analyses were sufficient to estimate or calculate OddsPath for the functional data for this variant.
    
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Look for mentions of statistical tests, p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, or direct calculation/reporting of OddsPath.
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 4a):** Proceed to Sub-step 4b.

* **Sub-step 4b: No OddsPath Calculation.**
    A total of 10 or less benign/pathogenic variant controls were used across the entire study for this variant's assay.
    
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Count the number of explicitly identified benign and pathogenic control variants used in the assays related to this variant.
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 4b):** The functional evidence strength is **Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting**.

Based on these steps, the final assessment for the variant `EGFR L858R` is:
