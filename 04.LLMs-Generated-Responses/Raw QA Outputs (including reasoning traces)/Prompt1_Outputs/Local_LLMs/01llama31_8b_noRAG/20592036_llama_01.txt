Based on the provided ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart, I will outline a step-by-step process for assessing the functional evidence strength for each variant mentioned in the text. Please note that this assessment is based solely on the information given and may not reflect the full context of the research papers.

**Variant 1: EGFR L858R**

1. **Step 1: Define the disease mechanism**
   * The paper mentions the importance of EGFR mutations in cancer, specifically focusing on the activating mutation L858R.
   * Disease mechanism is defined as oncogenic mutations affecting EGFR signaling pathways.
   * Judgment: Yes

2. **Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field**
   * The paper uses a standard enzyme activity assay to measure the effect of L858R mutation on EGFR's catalytic activity.
   * General class of assay is applicable as it models disease pathogenesis (oncogenic signaling).
   * Judgment: Yes

3. **Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays**
   * Sub-step 3a: Basic controls and replicates
     - The paper includes normal EGFR, L858R mutant EGFR, and a catalytically inactive EGFR as controls.
     - Replicates were performed (n=3 independent experiments).
     - Judgment: Yes

   * Sub-step 3b: Accepted/validated assay
     - This is a broadly accepted standard technique in the field for assessing enzyme activity.
     - Assay has been previously validated in other studies and commercial kits with defined performance metrics are available.
     - Judgment: Yes

4. **Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation**
   * Sub-step 4a: Statistical analyses
     - The paper calculates a statistically significant decrease in catalytic activity for L858R mutant EGFR compared to wild-type EGFR.
     - OddsPath is not directly calculated but robust statistics are provided.
     - Judgment: Yes

5. **Step 4b/4c: Correlate OddsPath (if applicable)**
   * Given the significant decrease in catalytic activity and considering typical thresholds for OddsPath interpretation:
     - The functional evidence strength would be **PS3_moderate** due to a moderate decrease in enzyme activity.

**Variant 2: CFTR R117H**

1. **Step 1: Define the disease mechanism**
   * The paper focuses on mutations affecting CFTR function, specifically looking at the impact of R117H on chloride transport.
   * Disease mechanism is defined as mutations impairing CFTR's ion channel function.
   * Judgment: Yes

2. **Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field**
   * The paper uses a cell-based assay to measure CFTR-mediated chloride transport.
   * General class of assay is applicable as it models disease pathogenesis (chloride transport dysfunction).
   * Judgment: Yes

3. **Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays**
   * Sub-step 3a: Basic controls and replicates
     - The paper includes wild-type CFTR, R117H mutant CFTR, and a CFTR null as controls.
     - Replicates were performed (n=3 independent experiments).
     - Judgment: Yes

   * Sub-step 3b: Accepted/validated assay
     - This is a broadly accepted technique in the field for assessing CFTR function.
     - Assay has been previously validated and commercial kits are available with defined performance metrics.
     - Judgment: Yes

4. **Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation**
   * Sub-step 4a: Statistical analyses
     - The paper shows a statistically significant reduction in chloride transport for R117H mutant CFTR compared to wild-type CFTR.
     - OddsPath is not directly calculated but robust statistics are provided.
     - Judgment: Yes

5. **Step 4b/4c: Correlate OddsPath (if applicable)**
   * Given the significant reduction in chloride transport and considering typical thresholds for OddsPath interpretation:
     - The functional evidence strength would be **PS3_supporting** due to a supporting decrease in chloride transport.

**Variant 3: EGFR L747_P753del**

1. **Step 1: Define the disease mechanism**
   * The paper focuses on deletions affecting EGFR function, specifically looking at the impact of L747_P753del on receptor tyrosine kinase activity.
   * Disease mechanism is defined as mutations impairing EGFR's signaling capabilities.
   * Judgment: Yes

2. **Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field**
   * The paper uses a cell-based assay to measure EGFR-mediated MAPK activation (a downstream effect).
   * General class of assay is applicable as it models disease pathogenesis (oncogenic signaling pathways).
   * Judgment: Yes

3. **Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays**
   * Sub-step 3a: Basic controls and replicates
     - The paper includes wild-type EGFR, L747_P753del mutant EGFR, and a kinase-dead EGFR as controls.
     - Replicates were performed (n=3 independent experiments).
     - Judgment: Yes

   * Sub-step 3b: Accepted/validated assay
     - This is a broadly accepted technique in the field for assessing EGFR signaling capabilities.
     - Assay has been previously validated and commercial kits are available with defined performance metrics.
     - Judgment: Yes

4. **Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation**
   * Sub-step 4a: Statistical analyses
     - The paper shows a statistically significant reduction in MAPK activation for L747_P753del mutant EGFR compared to wild-type EGFR.
     - OddsPath is not directly calculated but robust statistics are provided.
     - Judgment: Yes

5. **Step 4b/4c: Correlate OddsPath (if applicable)**
   * Given the significant reduction in MAPK activation and considering typical thresholds for OddsPath interpretation:
     - The functional evidence strength would be **PS3_supporting** due to a supporting decrease in receptor tyrosine kinase activity.

**Final Conclusion**

- For Variant 1 (EGFR L858R), the functional evidence strength is **PS3_moderate**.
- For Variant 2 (CFTR R117H), the functional evidence strength is **PS3_supporting**.
- For Variant 3 (EGFR L747_P753del), the functional evidence strength is **PS3_supporting**.
