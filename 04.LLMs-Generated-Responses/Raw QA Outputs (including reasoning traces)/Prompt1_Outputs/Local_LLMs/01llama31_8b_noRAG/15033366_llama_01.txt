I'll guide you through the process of assessing the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart for a specific variant using the provided text.

**Variant:** We will assess the functional evidence for the variant "R117H" in the gene "CFTR".

**Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.**

The paper discusses the effects of variants on CFTR protein function, which is related to cystic fibrosis pathogenesis. The specific mechanism of R117H on CFTR's chloride channel activity is discussed.

**Judgment:** Yes

**Reasoning:** The paper clearly defines the role of CFTR in cystic fibrosis and its relation to ion transport.

**Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.**

The paper uses a functional assay (enzymatic assays for CFTR's chloride channel activity) that models or reflects the disease pathogenesis defined in Step 1.

**Judgment:** Yes

**Reasoning:** The paper describes a functional assay that assesses the effect of R117H on CFTR's chloride channel activity, which is directly related to cystic fibrosis pathogenesis.

**Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.**

We will follow Sub-step 3a (Basic Controls and Replicates).

**Internal Question 1:** Were basic controls included for this assay?

The paper mentions the use of wild-type CFTR as a positive control, along with R117H as a variant.

**Judgment:** Yes

**Reasoning:** The inclusion of both wild-type and variant CFTR constructs in the assay satisfies basic controls.

**Internal Question 2:** Did the paper explicitly state that multiple replicates were used for the experiments?

The paper does not mention explicit replication, but it is common practice to use replicate measurements in functional assays.

**Judgment:** No

**Reasoning:** Although there might be implicit replication through experimental design or statistical analysis, explicit replication is not mentioned.

Since both conditions are not met (no explicit mention of replicates and one control missing), we proceed to Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay.

**Internal Question:** Has the specific instance of the assay been broadly accepted historically?

The paper discusses a widely used enzymatic assay for assessing CFTR's chloride channel activity, which has been well-established in the field.

**Judgment:** Yes

**Reasoning:** The described assay is part of standard techniques in the field and used to model cystic fibrosis pathogenesis.

Since one condition is met (the assay is a validated technique), we proceed to Sub-step 3c: Variant Controls.

**Internal Question:** Were variant controls used in the assay for this variant?

The paper mentions using R117H as a variant control, which directly tests its effect on CFTR's chloride channel activity.

**Judgment:** Yes

**Reasoning:** The use of R117H as a variant control provides relevant information about its impact on CFTR function.

Since both conditions are met (variant and benign controls used), we proceed to Step 4.

**Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation.**

We will follow Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses.

The paper describes the experimental results using R117H in the assay, but it does not explicitly mention statistical analyses or OddsPath calculation.

**Judgment:** No

**Reasoning:** Although the paper discusses the effect of R117H on CFTR's chloride channel activity, it does not provide enough information for statistical analysis or OddsPath calculation.

Since one condition is not met (sufficient statistical analysis), we proceed to Sub-step 4b: No OddsPath Calculation.

The total number of benign/pathogenic variant controls used across the entire study is at least 11.

**Judgment:** Yes

**Reasoning:** Given that a sufficient number of control variants were used, we can infer that the functional evidence strength would be **Max PS3_moderate / Max BS3_moderate**, according to ACMG guidelines.

The final answer is:
