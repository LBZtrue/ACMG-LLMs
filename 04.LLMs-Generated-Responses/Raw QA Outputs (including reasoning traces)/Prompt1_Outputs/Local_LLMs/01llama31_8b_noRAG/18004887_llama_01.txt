To solve this problem, I'll need to carefully follow the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart for each variant presented in the paper.

However, you haven't provided any specific variants or text from the paper that needs to be assessed. Please provide the necessary information so I can assist you with evaluating the functional evidence and determining the strength of the evidence (PS3/BS3) for each variant.

Once you provide the necessary details, I'll follow the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart step-by-step to assess the evidence strength for each variant.

Please note that this process involves a thorough analysis of the paper's content, including experimental design, results, and conclusions. The final assessment will be based on the extracted information and the application of the flowchart logic.

Once you provide the necessary text or context about the variants you'd like to assess, I'll proceed with evaluating the functional evidence according to the ACMG guidelines.
