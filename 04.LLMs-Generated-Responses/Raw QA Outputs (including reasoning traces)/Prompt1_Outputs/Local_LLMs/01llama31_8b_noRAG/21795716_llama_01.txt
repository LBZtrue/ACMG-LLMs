Based on the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart, I will guide you through the process of evaluating the functional evidence for each variant listed in the paper.

Please provide me with the list of variants from the paper that we need to evaluate.

Once you provide the list, I'll start by defining the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for each variant. We'll then proceed through the steps as outlined in the ACMG flowchart, using the provided information and making internal judgments based on the extracted text.

Let's get started!
