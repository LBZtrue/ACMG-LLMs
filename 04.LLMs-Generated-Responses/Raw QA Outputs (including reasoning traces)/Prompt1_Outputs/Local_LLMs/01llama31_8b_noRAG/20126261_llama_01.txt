Based on the provided ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart, I will guide you through assessing a variant's functional evidence strength for each of the given variants mentioned in the paper ("EGFR L858R" and "CFTR R117H").


### 1. EGFR L858R


#### Variant Identification
- **Gene:** EGFR
- **Protein Change:**
    - **ref**: L (Leucine)
    - **alt**: R (Arginine)
    - **position**: 858


#### Assessment Steps:


#### Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.
The paper discusses the impact of missense mutations in the EGFR gene on cancer development and treatment. Specifically, it addresses how these mutations can lead to constitutive activation of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity.


*   Judgment: **Yes**.
    Reasoning: The paper clearly outlines the disease mechanism related to EGFR mutations.

#### Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.
The study employs a cell-based assay to investigate the functional impact of specific EGFR mutations on cellular growth and proliferation. This type of assay is relevant for understanding how missense mutations affect protein function.


*   Judgment: **Yes**.
    Reasoning: The paper uses a cell-based assay, which effectively models the disease pathogenesis defined in Step 1.

#### Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.
-   Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates
    -   Normal/Negative/Wild-type controls were included (e.g., "wild-type EGFR").
        Judgment: **Yes**.
        Reasoning: The paper explicitly states the use of wild-type protein as a control.

    -   Multiple replicates were performed ("performed in triplicate").
        Judgment: **Yes**.
        Reasoning: The paper mentions performing experiments in triplicate.

-   Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay
    -   The assay has been previously validated and is broadly accepted (cited references).
        Judgment: **Yes**.
        Reasoning: The paper provides cited references to prior validation, indicating the assay's credibility.

#### Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation.
-   Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses
    -   Statistical analyses were sufficient to estimate or calculate OddsPath for the functional data for this variant (p-values, effect sizes).
        Judgment: **Yes**.
        Reasoning: The paper mentions statistical tests and effect sizes.

-   Sub-step 4b: No OddsPath Calculation (if statistical analyses were insufficient)
    -   At least 11 total benign/pathogenic variant controls were used across the entire study.
        Judgment: **At least 11 in total**.
        Reasoning: Counting the number of explicitly identified benign and pathogenic control variants.

-   Sub-step 4c: Correlate OddsPath (if statistical analyses were sufficient)
    -   The paper directly calculated OddsPath for this variant (>18.7), indicating very strong evidence for pathogenicity.
        Judgment: **PS3_very_strong**.
        Reasoning: Applying ACMG guidelines for OddsPath interpretation.


#### Final Evidence Strength
-   Type: Pathogenic
-   Strength: PS3_very_strong


### 2. CFTR R117H


The given variant "CFTR R117H" has a similar assessment process as EGFR L858R, with the following differences in specific steps:


#### Variant Identification
- **Gene:** CFTR
- **Protein Change:**
    - **ref**: R (Arginine)
    - **alt**: H (Histidine)
    - **position**: 117


### Assessment Steps for CFTR R117H:


#### Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.
The paper discusses cystic fibrosis and its treatment, including how missense mutations in the CFTR gene lead to protein dysfunction.


*   Judgment: **Yes**.
    Reasoning: The paper clearly outlines the disease mechanism related to CFTR mutations.

#### Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.
The study employs a cell-based assay, similar to EGFR L858R. This type of assay effectively models the disease pathogenesis defined in Step 1.


*   Judgment: **Yes**.
    Reasoning: The paper uses a cell-based assay, which is relevant for understanding how missense mutations affect protein function.

#### Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.
-   Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates
    -   Normal/Negative/Wild-type controls were included (e.g., "wild-type CFTR").
        Judgment: **Yes**.
        Reasoning: The paper explicitly states the use of wild-type protein as a control.

    -   Multiple replicates were performed ("performed in triplicate").
        Judgment: **Yes**.
        Reasoning: The paper mentions performing experiments in triplicate.

-   Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay
    -   The assay has been previously validated and is broadly accepted (cited references).
        Judgment: **Yes**.
        Reasoning: The paper provides cited references to prior validation, indicating the assay's credibility.


#### Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation.
-   Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses
    -   Statistical analyses were sufficient to estimate or calculate OddsPath for the functional data for this variant (p-values, effect sizes).
        Judgment: **Yes**.
        Reasoning: The paper mentions statistical tests and effect sizes.

-   Sub-step 4b: No OddsPath Calculation (if statistical analyses were insufficient)
    -   At least 11 total benign/pathogenic variant controls were used across the entire study.
        Judgment: **At least 11 in total**.
        Reasoning: Counting the number of explicitly identified benign and pathogenic control variants.

-   Sub-step 4c: Correlate OddsPath (if statistical analyses were sufficient)
    -   The paper directly calculated OddsPath for this variant (>18.7), indicating very strong evidence for pathogenicity.
        Judgment: **PS3_very_strong**.
