I'll provide a sample assessment for the variant associated with PTC124 treatment, which is a nonsense mutation in the CFTR gene.

**Assessment Objectives:** This LLM aims to determine if the functional assay used to demonstrate efficacy of PTC124 (Ataluren) can be used as evidence for pathogenicity according to ACMG guidelines. Specifically, we aim to use PS3 for this variant based on its nonsense mutation status and the effectiveness of PTC124 in rescuing CFTR protein function.

**Variant ID:** CFTR R117H

**Gene Symbol:** CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)

**Protein Change:**

* ref: R (Arginine)
* alt: H (Histidine)
* position: 117

**Variant String ID:** CFTR R117H

**Functional Evidence Aim:** Pathogenic (PS3) - Demonstrating efficacy of PTC124 treatment as evidence for pathogenicity.

This assessment follows the ACMG guidelines for evaluating the use of a specific instance of an assay as evidence for pathogenicity. The final conclusion supports the classification of the R117H variant as pathogenic based on the demonstration of efficacy by PTC124 in rescuing CFTR protein function, aligning with the ACMG's use of PS3 for nonsense mutations with demonstrated rescue by therapeutic agents targeting such mutations.
