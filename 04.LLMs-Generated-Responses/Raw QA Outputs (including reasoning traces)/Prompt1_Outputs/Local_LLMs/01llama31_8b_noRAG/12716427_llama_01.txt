I'll guide you through the process of assessing a variant based on the provided ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart.

First, we need to extract relevant information from the paper for each step of the flowchart. Please provide me with a brief summary or quote (up to 100 words) regarding the disease mechanism and how the gene/protein functions within it for the specific variant you'd like to assess. This will allow us to proceed to Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.

Additionally, please specify which variant you would like to assess, including its reference amino acid, alternate amino acid, and position (e.g., "EGFR L858R", "CFTR R117H").

Once we have this information, I'll assist in determining the functional evidence strength according to the ACMG guidelines.
