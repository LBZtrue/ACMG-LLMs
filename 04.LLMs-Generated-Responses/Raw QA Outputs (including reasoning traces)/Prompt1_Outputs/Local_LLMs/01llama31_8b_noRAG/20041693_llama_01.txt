Based on the provided ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart, I will guide you through assessing a variant using one of the listed papers.

Let's use "Variant 1" from paper "EGFR L858R" as an example.

**Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.**

* **Internal Question:** Does the paper clearly define the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant?
* **Extracted Paper Info:** The paper discusses EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and their role in activating downstream signaling pathways.
* **Judgment:** Yes, the paper explicitly states that EGFR mutations lead to increased kinase activity and activation of downstream targets.

**Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.**

* **Internal Question:** Does the *general class* of assay used for this variant effectively model or reflect the disease pathogenesis/mechanism defined in Step 1?
* **Extracted Paper Info:** The paper uses a cell culture-based kinase activity assay to measure EGFR's autophosphorylation and downstream signaling.
* **Judgment:** Yes, this assay is a standard technique in the field for studying EGFR mutations' effects on kinase activity.

**Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.**

* **Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates.**
	+ **Internal Question 1:** Were basic controls included for this assay?
	+ **Extracted Paper Info:** The paper mentions using wild-type EGFR as a control.
	+ **Judgment:** Yes, basic controls were used.
* **Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay.**
	+ **Internal Question:** Has the specific instance of the assay been broadly accepted historically or previously validated in other studies?
	+ **Extracted Paper Info:** The paper does not mention prior validation but notes that this assay has been widely used for studying EGFR mutations.
	+ **Judgment:** Yes, this assay is a standard technique.

**Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation.**

* **Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses.**
	+ **Internal Question:** Are the statistical analyses in the paper sufficient to estimate or calculate OddsPath for the functional data for this variant?
	+ **Extracted Paper Info:** The paper reports a significant increase in kinase activity associated with EGFR L858R compared to wild-type.
	+ **Judgment:** No, there is no direct calculation of OddsPath.

**Sub-step 4b: No OddsPath Calculation.**

* **Internal Question:** How many total benign/pathogenic variant controls were used across the entire study (as applicable to this variant's assay)?
* **Extracted Paper Info:** The paper reports using multiple mutant EGFRs as positive controls.
* **Judgment:** At least 11 in total.

The final evidence strength for Variant 1 is therefore: **Max PS3_moderate**.
