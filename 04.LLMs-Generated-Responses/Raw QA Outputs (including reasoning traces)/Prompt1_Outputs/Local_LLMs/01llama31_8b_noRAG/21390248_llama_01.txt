**Notes:**

* For the sake of brevity, not all steps are fully elaborated here.
* The final assessment may vary based on specific details within the paper or updates in guidelines/interpretations.
* These examples are simplified to illustrate the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart application; actual assessments might require more detailed analysis and consideration of other factors.
