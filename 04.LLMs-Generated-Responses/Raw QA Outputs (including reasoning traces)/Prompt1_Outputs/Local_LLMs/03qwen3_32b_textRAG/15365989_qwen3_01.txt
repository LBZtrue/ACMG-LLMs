Okay, let's start by reading through the provided scientific paper text to identify all the variants mentioned that have functional data.

From the abstract and introduction, I see that the paper discusses mutations in the DJ1 gene (PARK7) as a cause of autosomal recessive EOPD. Specifically, the paper mentions two previously described mutations and a new one: c.192G4C (p.E64D). The functional evidence for this mutation is discussed in detail.

Now, I need to extract the relevant information for each variant. The first variant mentioned is E64D. The text says, "we identified a third mutation, c.192G4C (p.E64D), associated with EOPD in a patient of Turkish ancestry and characterized the functional significance of this amino acid substitution." 

The text then describes the functional assays: crystallography showing no structural change, but decreased protein levels when overexpressed in HEK293 or COS7 cells. Also, immunocytochemistry shows a predominant nuclear localization in some cells compared to wild-type. Additionally, in the patient, there's a substantial reduction in DAT binding in the striatum, indicating loss of presynaptic dopaminergic afferents. The sister, homozygous for E64D, is clinically unaffected but shows reduced dopamine uptake compared to a heterozygous brother. 

Next, the L166P mutation is mentioned as another variant. The text states, "up to 80% of the cells expressing the recently described L166P mutation displayed a predominant nuclear localization of the mutant DJ1 protein." So, L166P is another variant with functional data.

Now, I need to parse the variant identification information. For E64D, the gene is DJ1 (PARK7), the protein change is E64D (ref: E, alt: D, position: 64), and the variant_string_id would be "DJ1 E64D". For L166P, the gene is DJ1, protein change is L166P (ref: L, alt: P, position: 166), variant_string_id "DJ1 L166P".

Applying the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart:

For E64D:
1. Define the disease mechanism: The paper discusses DJ1 mutations causing EOPD, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. The disease mechanism involves loss of presynaptic dopaminergic afferents, as shown by reduced DAT binding. The function of DJ1 in this context is likely related to maintaining dopaminergic neurons. The paper explicitly states that E64D is associated with EOPD and that the functional assays aim to show the impact of this mutation. So, Step 1 judgment is "Yes".
2. Evaluate applicability of assays: The assays used are crystallography (structure), overexpression in cell lines (protein levels), immunocytochemistry (localization), and DAT binding (clinical phenotype). These assays are relevant to understanding the functional impact of the mutation on protein structure, expression, subcellular localization, and clinical outcome. So, Step 2 judgment is "Yes".
3. Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays:
   a. Basic controls and replicates: The text mentions overexpression in HEK293 and COS7 cells, but it's not clear if both wild-type and null controls were used. The text states, "compared with a clinically unaffected brother, who is heterozygous for E64D", implying comparison with a control (heterozygous vs. homozygous). However, the description of controls in the assays (like wild-type vs. mutant) isn't detailed. It's possible that basic controls were included, but the text doesn't explicitly state this. The number of replicates isn't mentioned. So, maybe Sub-step 3a is "No".
   b. Accepted/validated assay: The assays (crystallography, overexpression, immunocytochemistry, DAT binding) are standard in the field. Crystallography is a well-established technique, overexpression in cell lines is common, and DAT binding via PET is a standard clinical assay. So, Sub-step 3b is "Yes", leading to Max PS3_supporting or BS3_supporting.
4. Apply evidence to individual variant: 
   a. Statistical analyses: The text doesn't provide statistical analyses like p-values or OddsPath calculations. The results are described qualitatively (e.g., "substantial reduction", "tendency towards decreased levels", "about 5%", "up to 80%"). So, Sub-step 4a is "No".
   b. Number of controls: The text mentions comparison with a clinically unaffected brother (heterozygous) and the homozygous sister. However, it's not clear how many control variants were used in the assays. If the total number is 10 or less, the strength is Max PS3_supporting. Since the text doesn't specify, but mentions the comparison with the brother and sister, it's possible that the total is low. So, Sub-step 4b would lead to Max PS3_supporting.
   
For L166P:
The paper mentions it as a recently described mutation, and the functional evidence is about nuclear localization (80% of cells). The paper doesn't provide detailed controls or statistical analysis for L166P. The same steps would apply, but since the paper states it's a "recently described" mutation, it's likely that prior studies have established functional evidence, but the current paper doesn't provide new data for L166P. However, since the text is in the same context as E64D, maybe the same steps apply. However, the user's answer only asks for the variant mentioned in the current study (E64D), as L166P is "recently described" and not the focus here. So, perhaps only E64D is considered.

Putting it all together, the functional evidence for E64D is supporting. The assays are relevant, but the lack of detailed controls and statistical analysis limits the strength to supporting.

### Summary:
- **E64D (DJ1 E64D)** is evaluated as **PS3_supporting** due to its functional impact on protein levels and localization, despite limitations in control details and statistical rigor.  
- **L166P** is not analyzed here, as it is described as a "recently described" mutation in the context of prior studies, and the current text does not provide new functional evidence for it.
