Okay, let's start by extracting the relevant information from the provided text. The user mentioned two variants: I2020T and G2019S in the LRRK2 gene. 

First, I need to identify the gene and the protein changes for each variant. The gene is LRRK2. For I2020T, the reference amino acid is I (Isoleucine), the alternate is T (Threonine), and the position is 2020. So the variant string ID would be LRRK2 I2020T. Similarly, G2019S is from Glycine (G) to Serine (S) at position 2019, making the variant string ID LRRK2 G2019S.

Next, the functional evidence aim. The paper discusses how these mutations affect kinase activity and ATP affinity, which are relevant to Parkinson's disease. The aim for functional evidence would be pathogenic since the variants are associated with increased disease risk.

Now, applying the ACMG flowchart. 

Starting with Step 1: Define the disease mechanism. The paper states that LRRK2 mutations are a cause of PD and that inhibiting LRRK2 kinase activity is a potential treatment. This clearly defines the disease mechanism, so the judgment here is "Yes".

Step 2: Evaluate the applicability of assays. The paper uses binding and enzymatic assays. Since the disease mechanism involves kinase activity, these assays are directly relevant. So, "Yes" here, proceed to Step 3.

Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific assays. Sub-step 3a: Basic controls and replicates. The paper mentions wild-type LRRK2 as a control and compares mutants. They also mention performing assays in triplicate. So controls and replicates are present. Judgment "Yes", proceed to Sub-step 3c.

Sub-step 3c: Variant controls. The paper uses G2019S and I2020T as mutants but doesn't mention known pathogenic/benign variants as controls. So "No" here. Then, since Sub-step 3a was "Yes", but 3c is "No", the evidence strength is Max PS3_supporting/BS3_supporting.

Step 4: Apply evidence. Sub-step 4a: Statistical analyses. The paper provides fold changes and mentions statistical significance (e.g., 2-fold lower, 6-fold higher). However, there's no mention of OddsPath or detailed statistical tests like p-values. So "No", proceed to Sub-step 4b.

Sub-step 4b: Total control variants. The paper mentions G2019S and I2020T but doesn't list other controls. So total controls are 2, which is less than 10. Hence, the strength remains Max PS3_supporting/BS3_supporting.

Therefore, for both variants, the final evidence strength is PS3_supporting. 

For G2019S, the paper shows increased ATP affinity and higher kinase activity. For I2020T, decreased ATP affinity and lower kinase activity. Both affect the disease mechanism, leading to PS3_supporting.
