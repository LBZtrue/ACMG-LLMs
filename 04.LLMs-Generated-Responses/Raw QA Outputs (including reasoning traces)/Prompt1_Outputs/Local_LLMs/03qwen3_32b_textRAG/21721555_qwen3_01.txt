Okay, let's start by extracting the variants mentioned in the provided text. The user mentioned two substitutions: A53T and S87N. 

First, the gene in question is α-synuclein, which is commonly abbreviated as SNCA. The variants are A53T and S87N. 

Next, I need to determine the functional evidence for each variant. The paper states that the A53T substitution dominates the growth kinetics, which suggests that this variant has a significant impact on the aggregation process. The S87N substitution is mentioned as affecting the lag phase when combined with A53T. 

Applying the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart:

Step 1: The disease mechanism is defined as the aggregation of α-synuclein leading to Parkinson's Disease. The paper clearly links α-synuclein aggregation to PD, so this step is satisfied for both variants.

Step 2: The assays used are fluorescence analysis and NMR chemical shift analysis. These are relevant to the disease mechanism because they assess aggregation kinetics and conformational changes, which are directly related to amyloid formation in PD. So, the assays are applicable.

Step 3: For basic controls and replicates, the paper mentions a systematic series of eight human-mouse chimeras. It's likely that wild-type and other variants were used as controls, and the experiments were replicated. However, the text doesn't explicitly state the number of replicates or controls. If the paper doesn't specify, we might need to check if the assays are broadly accepted. NMR and fluorescence are standard techniques, so this might qualify under Sub-step 3b. 

Step 4: Statistical analyses are mentioned in terms of comparing lag times and growth rates. However, specific statistical tests, p-values, or OddsPath calculations aren't detailed. So, Sub-step 4a might not be met. Moving to Sub-step 4b, the number of control variants used is eight chimeras, which is less than 11, so the evidence would be supporting.

For A53T, since it's the dominant factor in growth kinetics, it's likely pathogenic (PS3_supporting). For S87N, which affects the lag phase when combined with A53T, the effect is less direct, so maybe it's also pathogenic but with supporting evidence. However, since it's part of a combination, the strength might be lower. Wait, the paper says the lag phase is affected by a combination of A53T and S87N. So, the effect of S87N alone isn't clear. If the study didn't test S87N in isolation, then the evidence for S87N might be weaker.

Putting this all together for each variant:

For A53T:
- The assay is applicable.
- Controls and replicates aren't explicitly stated, but the assays are standard.
- The effect is strong and directly on growth kinetics, which is a key part of the disease mechanism.
- Since statistical details are lacking, but the effect is significant, it's PS3_supporting.

For S87N:
- The assay is applicable.
- The effect is in combination with A53T, so the individual effect isn't clear.
- Without specific data on S87N alone, the evidence is weaker.
- Also, the number of controls is less than 11, so it's PS3_supporting, but maybe even less. However, the paper does mention the lag phase is affected by S87N when combined with A53T. But since the paper doesn't isolate S87N's effect, the evidence might not be strong enough for PS3. Perhaps BS3? Wait, the paper says S87N is part of the combination affecting the lag phase. If the lag phase is part of the aggregation process, which is disease-relevant, then S87N's effect might be pathogenic. But since it's part of a combination, the evidence is weaker. So maybe PS3_supporting.

But according to the flowchart, if the number of controls is less than 11, then it's Max PS3_supporting. So both variants would get PS3_supporting. However, the paper states that the presence of alanine at position 53 (i.e., the wild-type) may be an evolutionary adaptation to minimize PD, suggesting that the T at 53 (A53T) is pathogenic. Therefore, A53T is pathogenic, and S87N, being part of the combination, might be less clear. But the paper doesn't provide enough data on S87N alone. So for S87N, the evidence is weaker, but still PS3_supporting because it's part of the combination affecting the lag phase, which is relevant to the disease mechanism.

Wait, the user's instruction says to apply the ACMG flowchart step-by-step. So for each variant, we need to go through each step.

For A53T:

Step 1: Disease mechanism is defined. Yes.

Step 2: Assay is applicable. Yes.

Step 3: Basic controls and replicates? The paper mentions a systematic series of eight chimeras. It's likely that wild-type and other variants were used as controls. However, the text doesn't explicitly state the number of replicates. If the paper doesn't mention replicates, then step 3a would fail. Then, move to 3b: Is the assay broadly accepted? Yes. So, the evidence strength is Max PS3_supporting.

Step 4: Statistical analyses? The paper doesn't provide specific stats, so move to 4b. Number of controls is 8 (since there are eight chimeras), which is less than 11. So, Max PS3_supporting.

For S87N:

Step 1: Yes.

Step 2: Yes.

Step 3: The same as A53T. The paper uses the same assays and chimeras. So, controls and replicates are same as A53T. So, step 3a: if the paper doesn't mention replicates, then 3a fails, and 3b applies. So, Max PS3_supporting.

Step 4: Again, same as A53T. Number of controls is 8, so 4b applies. Max PS3_supporting.

But the paper says S87N is part of the combination affecting the lag phase. However, the effect of S87N alone isn't clear. The flowchart doesn't consider the combination, it's per variant. So, even if S87N's effect is only in combination, the evidence for S87N is still based on the study's design. Since the study includes S87N in the chimeras, and the effect is observed in combination, but the variant is still considered in the analysis. So, the evidence for S87N is PS3_supporting.

Therefore, both variants get PS3_supporting.
