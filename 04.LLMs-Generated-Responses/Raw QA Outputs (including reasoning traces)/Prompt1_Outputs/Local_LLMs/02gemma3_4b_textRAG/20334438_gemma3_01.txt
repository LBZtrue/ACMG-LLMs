Loss of motor function is associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and is not clinically apparent until approximately 70% of these cells are lost. The etiology of the disease is not understood",

This study compared mitochondria prepared from differentiated SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing WT or A53T R-syn using 2-D difference in-gel electrophoresis.",
