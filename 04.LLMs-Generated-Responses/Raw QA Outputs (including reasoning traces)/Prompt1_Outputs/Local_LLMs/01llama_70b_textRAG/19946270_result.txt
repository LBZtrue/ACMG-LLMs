Explanation:
Based on the provided scientific paper text, no functional evidence details were extractable due to the lack of explicit or inferable information on the disease mechanism. The ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart was applied to the best extent possible, but the lack of a defined disease mechanism prevented further analysis. The assessment steps, final evidence strength, and overall conclusion were provided accordingly.
