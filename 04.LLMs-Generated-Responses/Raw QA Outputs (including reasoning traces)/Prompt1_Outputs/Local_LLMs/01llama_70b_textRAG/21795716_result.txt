I'm sorry, but the provided context does not seem to contain any information about specific gene variants or their functional evidence. It appears to be a scientific paper discussing some aspects of cell biology and biochemistry, possibly related to autophagy and iron metabolism. However, without specific details about gene variants and their functional significance, I cannot apply the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart or perform the desired analysis. Please provide me with the necessary information regarding gene variants and their functional data, so I can assist you further.
