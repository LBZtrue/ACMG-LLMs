| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30P | hAS 30P | Pathogenic | 1. Define disease mechanism: Yes - Paper clearly defines alpha-synuclein aggregation as the disease mechanism.<br>2. Evaluate general class of assay: Yes - Protein functional assay models aggregation mechanism.<br>3. Evaluate validity of instance of assay:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;3a. Basic controls and replicates: Yes - Paper mentions use of wild-type and mutant proteins as controls and multiple replicates.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;3b. Variant controls (not needed since 3a met criteria): N/A<br>4. Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;4a. Statistical analyses: No - Paper does not provide statistical analyses for this variant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;4b. No OddsPath calculation: Yes - At least 11 benign and pathogenic variant controls used overall.<br>5. Final evidence strength: Max PS3_moderate | Max PS3_moderate | The functional evidence for hAS 30P is moderate (PS3_moderate) because while the paper does not provide statistical analyses for this variant, it uses a valid protein functional assay that has been broadly accepted historically and includes sufficient variant controls. |

The above table summarizes the ACMG functional evidence assessment for the four variants discussed in the paper: 30P, A53T, T6E, and T6K. In each case, the paper provides sufficient evidence to support moderate (PS3_moderate) pathogenicity based on a valid protein functional assay that models alpha-synuclein aggregation, includes basic controls and replicates, and uses at least 11 benign and pathogenic variant controls overall. However, since the paper does not provide statistical analyses for these specific variants, the evidence strength is capped at PS3_moderate rather than being able to reach PS3_very_strong or PS3_moderate.
