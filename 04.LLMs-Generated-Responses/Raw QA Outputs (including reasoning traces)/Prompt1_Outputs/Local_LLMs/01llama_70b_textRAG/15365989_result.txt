**Analysis:** Based on the provided text, there are no explicit mentions of a functional assay related to a genetic variant, nor are there any direct statements about the disease mechanism or applicability of any specific assays. Therefore, it is not possible to apply the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart to derive the strength of functional evidence (PS3 for pathogenic, BS3 for benign) for any variant.

**Output:**
