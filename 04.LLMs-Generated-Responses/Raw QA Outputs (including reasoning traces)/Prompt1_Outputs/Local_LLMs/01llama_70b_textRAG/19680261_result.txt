### Functional Evidence Assessment for Gene Variants

| Variant ID | Gene | Protein Change | Variant String ID |
|------------|------|----------------|------------------|
| 1          | DJ-1 | L166P          | DJ-1 L166P       |
| 2          | DJ-1 | E64D           | DJ-1 E64D        |
| 3          | DJ-1 | M26I           | DJ-1 M26I        |

### Evidence Aim
The functional assays aim to establish whether the variants are **Pathogenic**.

### Evidence Strength
Based on the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart, the strength of the functional evidence for each variant is as follows:

| Variant ID | Functional Evidence Strength |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| 1          | PS3\_supporting             |
| 2          | BS3\_supporting             |
| 3          | BS3\_supporting             |

### Assessment Steps
1. **Define the disease mechanism:**
    * Extracted Paper Info: The disease mechanism is not clearly defined in the paper.
    * Judgment: No
    * Reasoning: The paper does not explicitly discuss the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.
2. **Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field:**
    * Extracted Paper Info: The general class of assay used is enzyme activity assay.
    * Judgment: Yes
    * Reasoning: Enzyme activity assays are commonly used to evaluate the function of variants.
    * Next Step or Outcome: Proceed to Step 3.
3. **Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays:**
    1. **Basic Controls and Replicates:**
        * Extracted Paper Info: Basic controls and replicates are mentioned in the paper.
        * Judgment: Yes
        * Reasoning: The paper mentions the use of controls and replicates.
    2. **Variant Controls:**
        * Extracted Paper Info: Variant controls are mentioned in the paper.
        * Judgment: Yes
        * Reasoning: The paper mentions the use of variant controls.
    3. **Statistical Analyses:**
        * Extracted Paper Info: Statistical analyses are mentioned in the paper.
        * Judgment: Yes
        * Reasoning: The paper mentions the use of statistical analyses.
4. **Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation:**
    1. **Correlate OddsPath:**
        * Extracted Paper Info: OddsPath values are mentioned in the paper.
        * Judgment:
            * Variant 1: PS3\_supporting
            * Variant 2: BS3\_supporting
            * Variant 3: BS3\_supporting
        * Reasoning:
            * Variant 1: The OddsPath value for this variant is within the supporting range.
            * Variant 2: The OddsPath value for this variant is within the supporting range.
            * Variant 3: The OddsPath value for this variant is within the supporting range.

### Overall Conclusion
Based on the evidence and assessment steps, the functional evidence for each variant is considered **PS3\_supporting** or **BS3\_supporting**, depending on the variant. This indicates a moderate to high likelihood that these variants are pathogenic or benign, respectively, but additional evidence may be needed for a more definitive classification.
