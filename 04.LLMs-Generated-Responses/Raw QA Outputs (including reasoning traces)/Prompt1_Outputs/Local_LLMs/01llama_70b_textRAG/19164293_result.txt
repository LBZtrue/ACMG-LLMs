**ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart (Reference Standard for LLM's Internal Logic):**

**Step 1: Define the disease mechanism.**
* **Internal Question:** Does the paper clearly define the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant?
* **Internal Judgment Basis:** Extract explicit statements or strong inferences about the disease's molecular basis and how the gene/protein functions within it.

**Step 2: Evaluate applicability of general classes of assay used in the field.**
* **Internal Question:** Does the *general class* of assay used for this variant (e.g., enzyme activity assay, protein interaction assay, gene expression assay, cell phenotype rescue assay, etc.) effectively model or reflect the disease pathogenesis/mechanism defined in Step 1?
* **Internal Decision Logic:**
    * If **NO**: Then **Do not use PS3/BS3**. (Functional evidence not applicable).
    * If **YES**: Proceed to Step 3.

**Step 3: Evaluate validity of specific instances of assays.**
* **Sub-step 3a: Basic Controls and Replicates.**
    * **Internal Question 1:** Were basic controls included for this assay? Specifically, were *both* "Normal/Negative/Wild type" **AND** "Abnormal/Positive/Null" controls used?
    * **Internal Question 2:** Did the paper explicitly state that multiple replicates were used for the experiments?
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Search "Materials and Methods" and "Results" for descriptions of controls (e.g., "wild-type protein," "empty vector," "known loss-of-function mutant," "known gain-of-function mutant") and details on experimental repetition (e.g., "performed in triplicate," "n=3 independent experiments").
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 3a):**
        * If **NO** (either condition not met): Proceed to Sub-step 3b.
        * If **YES** (both conditions met): Proceed to Sub-step 3c.

* **Sub-step 3b: Accepted/Validated Assay (if basic controls/replicates were insufficient in 3a).**
    * **Internal Question:** Has the specific instance of the assay been:
        * a) Broadly accepted historically (e.g., standard technique in the field)? **OR**
        * b) Previously validated in other studies (cited)? **OR**
        * c) Provided as a commercial kit with defined performance metrics, *but* where controls/replicates are not documented for the specific instance of the assay in *this* paper?
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Look for statements on assay novelty, references to prior validation, or mentions of commercial kits/standards.
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 3b):**
        * If **NO** (all conditions not met): Then **Do not use PS3/BS3**.
        * If **YES** (any condition met): The functional evidence strength is **Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting**.

* **Sub-step 3c: Variant Controls (if basic controls/replicates were sufficient in 3a).**
    * **Internal Question:** Were variant controls used in the assay for this variant? Specifically, were:
        * Known pathogenic variants used as controls? **OR**
        * Known benign variants used as controls? **OR**
        * Were variants tested that reach P/LP (Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic) or B/LB (Benign/Likely Benign) criteria *without* relying on PS3/BS3 evidence themselves?
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Identify lists of variants used as positive/negative controls and their stated classifications or known status.
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 3c):**
        * If **NO** (all conditions not met): The functional evidence strength is **Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting**.
        * If **YES** (any condition met): Proceed to Step 4.

**Step 4: Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation.**
* **Sub-step 4a: Statistical Analyses.**
    * **Internal Question:** Are the statistical analyses in the paper sufficient to estimate or calculate OddsPath for the functional data for this variant? (OddsPath refers to a quantitative measure of pathogenicity likelihood from functional assays).
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Look for mentions of statistical tests, p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, or direct calculation/reporting of OddsPath.
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 4a):**
        * If **NO**: Proceed to Sub-step 4b.
        * If **YES**: Proceed to Sub-step 4c.

* **Sub-step 4b: No OddsPath Calculation (if statistical analyses were insufficient).**
    * **Internal Question:** How many total benign/pathogenic variant controls were used across the entire study (as applicable to this variant's assay)?
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Count the number of explicitly identified benign and pathogenic control variants used in the assays related to this variant.
    * **Internal Decision Logic (for 4b):**
        * If **10 or less** in total: The functional evidence strength is **Max PS3_supporting / Max BS3_supporting**.
        * If **At least 11** in total: The functional evidence strength is **Max PS3_moderate / Max BS3_moderate**.

* **Sub-step 4c: Correlate OddsPath (if statistical analyses were sufficient).**
    * **Internal Information:** Extract the OddsPath value calculated in the paper for this variant. If a direct OddsPath is not given but robust statistics are, infer the strength.
    * **Internal Judgment Basis:** Apply ACMG guidelines for OddsPath interpretation (e.g., assuming standard thresholds: PS3: OddsPath > 18.7 = very_strong; OddsPath > 4.3 = moderate; OddsPath > 2.0 = supporting. BS3: OddsPath < 1/18.7 = very_strong; OddsPath < 1/4.3 = moderate; OddsPath < 1/2.0 = supporting).
    * **Internal Decision Logic (Typical Outcomes):**
        * For PS3 (Pathogenic):
            * OddsPath very high (e.g., > 18.7): **PS3_very_strong**
            * OddsPath moderate (e.g., > 4.3 and <= 18.7): **PS3_moderate**
            * OddsPath supporting (e.g., > 2.0 and <= 4.3): **PS3_supporting**
        * For BS3 (Benign):
            * OddsPath very low (e.g., < 1/18.7): **BS3_very_strong**
            * OddsPath moderate (e.g., < 1/4.3 and >= 1/18.7): **BS3_moderate**
            * OddsPath supporting (e.g., < 1/2.0 and >= 1/4.3): **BS3_supporting**
