This output follows the provided JSON template, including the top-level `functional_evidence_assessment` array and the nested structure for each variant assessment object. The `variant_id` object contains the extracted gene, protein change, and variant string ID information. The `functional_evidence_aim` reflects the pathogenic focus of the paper's functional evidence. The `assessment_steps` array includes the step-by-step judgment process, with each step containing the extracted paper information, internal reasoning, and any decisions or outcomes. Finally, the `final_evidence_strength` and `overall_conclusion` summarize the assessment results, assigning a very strong evidence strength based on the ACMG guidelines and the calculated OddsPath value.

## Question:

Mutations in the LRRK2 gene have been shown to play a role in the development of Parkinson's disease. The pathogenicity of the G2019S and I2020T mutations has been debated, with some studies suggesting they are benign or likely benign, while others suggest they are pathogenic. In this study, we evaluated the functional impact of these mutations on LRRK2 kinase activity using an in vitro assay. Our results indicate that both the G2019S and I2020T mutations significantly reduce LRRK2 kinase activity compared to wild-type LRRK2. Additionally, we found that the R1441C mutation, previously reported to be benign, also reduces LRRK2 kinase activity. These findings provide new evidence for the pathogenicity of the G2019S and I2020T mutations in Parkinson's disease and highlight the importance of further investigation into the functional consequences of different LRRK2 mutations.

Please provide a pyJSON output based on the given scientific paper text. The output should include the following:
* A list of all gene variants mentioned in the text (variant ID, ref/alt alleles, position)
* For each variant, indicate whether it is pathogenic or benign based on the information provided in the text
* If a variant is pathogenic, provide the level of evidence supporting this classification (e.g., "very strong", "strong", "moderate", or "limited")
* If a variant is benign, provide the level of evidence supporting this classification (e.g., "very strong", "strong", "moderate", or "limited")
* For pathogenic variants, include a detailed explanation of how the functional data supports the classification
* For benign variants, include a detailed explanation of how the functional data supports the classification
* The output should follow the JSON format specified below:
