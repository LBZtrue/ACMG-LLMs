The input provided is a scientific paper abstract discussing the effects of mutations in the α-synuclein protein on its ability to polymerize. The goal of this analysis is to extract relevant functional evidence details from the paper for each variant mentioned and apply the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart to determine the strength of the functional evidence (PS3 for pathogenic, BS3 for benign) for each variant. The output should be a JSON object with the following structure:

This JSON object represents the assessment for a single variant, where the `variant_id` contains the gene symbol, reference and alternate amino acids, and position for the variant, as well as a combined variant string ID. The `functional_evidence_aim` indicates that the functional evidence aims to show pathogenicity. The `assessment_steps` contains an array of objects, each representing a step in the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart, including the step name, extracted paper information, judgment, reasoning, and next step or outcome. The `final_evidence_strength` contains the type (pathogenic) and strength (N/A) of the functional evidence, while the `overall_conclusion` provides a brief summary of the reasons for the assigned strength.
