The authors utilized a well-established cell-based assay system to study the effects of the mutation on protein function and cellular processes. They included basic controls, replicates, variant controls, and performed statistical analyses on their experimental data. While the total number of benign/pathogenic variant controls was less than the threshold required to proceed to Sub-step 4c, the authors calculated an OddsPath value of 5.8, which is supportive of pathogenicity. Therefore, based on the ACMG guidelines, the functional evidence strength is Max PS3_supporting."
