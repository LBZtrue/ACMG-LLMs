**Functional Evidence Assessment for Gene Variants:**

**Note:** The provided scientific paper text does not contain any explicit variant information or functional assay data for specific gene mutations. Therefore, no assessment can be made using the ACMG Functional Evidence Evaluation Flowchart. A possible reason may be that this is only an abstract and not the full paper, so more details could be missing. Please provide the full paper for a complete evaluation.
