### Functional Evidence Assessment of Variants

**Input Text:**
```
d 250 controls, and from the analysis of 17 polymorphic variants identified five variants (including p.G2385R and p.R1628P) of interest. Further casecontrol studies involving these variants in three independent cohorts identified p.S1647T as a risk factor and p.R1398H and p.N551K as protective factors. As expected, p.G2385R and p.R1628P were also f

bserved in all three replication cohorts. A higher frequency of two previously described risk variants p.G2385R and p.R1628P was consistently noted across all the data sets.

##Pooled Analysis
A combined analysis of the four case-control cohorts revealed that p.R1398H and p.N551K were associated with a decreased risk and p.S1647T, p.R1628P, and p.G

 5 P( D Â (OR)À1), b 5 21P( D) Â (ORÀ1)ÀP(A) Â (OR11
), g 5 P(A), and P( D) 5 1ÀP(D). Relative risks for multiple SNPs were calculated as the product of the individual relative risks, which is equivalent to assuming independent effects between the SNPs.
The combined study sample size has 490% power to detect an allelic effect corresponding to an OR

Explanation: The input text does not contain sufficient details to evaluate the functional evidence for the variants. Therefore, the output provides a default assessment stating that there is insufficient information to evaluate the functional evidence. The steps in the ACMG flowchart could not be followed beyond Step 2 due to missing data required for subsequent steps.
