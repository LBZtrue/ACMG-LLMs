##Data Science
`Question:`
Which of the following is not a type of Naive Bayes classifier? A. Bernoulli Naive Bayes B. Gaussian Naive Bayes C. Multinomial Naive Bayes D. Logistic Regression
`Answer:`
D. Logistic Regression is not a type of Naive Bayes classifier. It is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, but it does not assume independence between features like Naive Bayes does. The other three options (A, B, and C) are all types of Naive Bayes classifiers.
