**Note:**
* This example assumes that both TTRAP M26I and L166P variants were tested in the paper and have functional evidence available. In reality, you may need to search the entire paper for other variants that have functional data and follow the same procedure for each variant.
* The final evidence strength is based on the ACMG guidelines for functional evidence evaluation. If you have different guidelines or thresholds, please adapt the decision logic and strength assignments accordingly.
* I've included all relevant steps in the assessment process, but in practice, some steps may not be applicable for certain variants or papers. You can omit unnecessary steps as long as you have clear reasoning for each judgment and outcome.
