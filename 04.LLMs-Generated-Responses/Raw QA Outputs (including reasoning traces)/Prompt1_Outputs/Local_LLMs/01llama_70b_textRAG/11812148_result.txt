**Note**: The above output is a Python list containing two dictionaries, one for each variant (A53T and A30P). Each dictionary follows the structure outlined in the prompt, including the `variant_id`, `functional_evidence_aim`, `assessment_steps`, `final_evidence_strength`, and `overall_conclusion`. The `assessment_steps` list contains multiple dictionaries, each representing a step in the ACMG functional evidence evaluation flowchart, with the `step_name`, `extracted_paper_info`, `judgment`, `reasoning`, and optionally `next_step_or_outcome` or `outcome` (if applicable). The `final_evidence_strength` and `overall_conclusion` are based on the judgments made at each step of the flowchart. Please note that this is just one possible representation of the output; you may choose to format it differently as long as it meets the requirements specified in the prompt.
