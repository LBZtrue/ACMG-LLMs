Okay, I need to analyze the given scientific text and extract the functional evidence for each of the three αSyn variants: A30P, E46K, and A53T. Let's start by understanding the task.

First, the user provided a paper abstract that discusses the effects of these mutations on αSyn. The main points are about how the proteasome cleaves αSyn, leading to fragments that accelerate fibrillization. The mutations have different effects on amyloidogenicity and vesicle-binding. However, the paper also mentions that the rate of formation of cytotoxic oligomers correlates with the mutations when proteasome and liposomes are present. The wildtype is also cleaved but at a slower rate.

The task is to extract for each variant the gene, protein change, variant ID, and then apply the ACMG flowchart to determine the evidence strength. The output should be in JSON format as per the given structure.

Let me break it down step by step for each variant.

Starting with the first variant: A30P. The paper states that these three mutations are associated with early-onset PD. The functional data includes that the proteasome cleaves both mutant and wildtype αSyn, producing C-terminal fragments. These fragments accelerate fibrillization, but there's no clear correlation between the mutations and amyloid formation. However, the rate of formation of cytotoxic oligomers correlates with the mutations when proteasome and liposomes are present. The wildtype is also cleaved but slower.

For Step 1: Define disease mechanism. The paper defines that αSyn is a key component of Lewy bodies, and the mutations are linked to PD. The proteasome cleavage leads to fragments that affect fibrillization and oligomer formation. So, the disease mechanism is related to αSyn processing and oligomer formation.

Step 2: Evaluate applicability of the assay. The assay here is the proteasome cleavage and subsequent oligomer formation. The paper uses this to model the disease mechanism, so this is applicable. Therefore, proceed to Step 3.

Step 3: Evaluate validity of the assay. The paper mentions that the proteasome cleaves both mutant and wildtype, and the fragments lead to accelerated fibrillization. However, the paper doesn't mention controls (like wildtype vs. mutant) or replicates. So, basic controls (normal and abnormal) are not mentioned. Therefore, move to Sub-step 3b.

Sub-step 3b: Are the assays accepted or validated? The paper doesn't mention prior validation of this specific assay, but it's a known method for proteasome activity. However, the paper doesn't cite prior studies on this exact assay. So, maybe not. So, the evidence is Max PS3_supporting.

But wait, the paper does mention that the proteasome cleavage is demonstrated in vitro, and the fragments are observed. Since the assay is a known method (proteasome activity), maybe it's considered accepted. However, the paper doesn't cite prior validation, so maybe not. Hmm. The judgment here is tricky. If the assay is a standard one, even without prior citation, but the paper's results are from the study, then it's considered valid. But according to the flowchart, if the assay is not validated in prior studies, then it's Max supporting. So, the evidence is Max PS3_supporting.

But the paper does mention that the proteasome cleavage was demonstrated in vitro, so maybe it's considered valid. However, the flowchart requires that the assay is accepted or validated. Since the paper doesn't cite prior studies on this specific assay, but the method is standard, maybe it's considered accepted. So, the evidence is Max PS3_supporting.

But the paper doesn't mention variant controls. So, moving to Step 4.

In Step 4a: Statistical analysis. The paper mentions that the rate of formation of oligomers correlates with the mutations. However, it doesn't provide p-values or statistical tests. So, no statistical analysis. Therefore, move to Sub-step 4b.

Sub-step 4b: Number of controls. The paper mentions that the wildtype is also cleaved, but there's no mention of other control variants. So, the number of controls is not specified. Therefore, the evidence is Max PS3_supporting.

So, the final strength is PS3_supporting.

Now for E46K. The same applies. The paper says that the mutations have different effects on amyloidogenicity and vesicle-binding, but no clear correlation with amyloid formation. However, the rate of oligomer formation correlates with the mutations. The wildtype is also cleaved but slower. So, same steps as A30P. The evidence is PS3_supporting.

For A53T, same situation. The paper states that the mutations have different effects on amyloidogenicity and vesicle-binding, but no clear correlation. However, the rate of oligomer formation correlates with the mutations. The wildtype is also cleaved but slower. So, same steps. Evidence is PS3_supporting.

Wait, but the paper says that the rate of formation of the soluble, cytotoxic oligomers correlated with the disease-associated mutations when both proteasome and liposomes are present. So, this is a key finding. The wildtype is also cleaved but at a slower rate. So, the mutations lead to higher rates of oligomer formation. Therefore, the functional evidence is that the mutations are associated with increased cytotoxic oligomer formation, which is a pathogenic mechanism.

Therefore, for each variant, the evidence is PS3_supporting.
