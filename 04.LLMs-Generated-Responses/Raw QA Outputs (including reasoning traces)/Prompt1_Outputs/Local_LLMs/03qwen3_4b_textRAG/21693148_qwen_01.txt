Okay, I need to analyze the given scientific text and extract the functional evidence for each variant mentioned. Let's start by identifying the variants in the abstract.

First, the abstract mentions D30K UCH-L1, which lacks ubiquitin binding activity. Then there's C90S UCH-L1, which lacks hydrolase activity. Also, the I93M mutation in UCH-L1 is associated with Parkinson's disease. Additionally, a-synuclein mutants are linked to reduced secretion of endogenous UCH-L1.

So, the variants here are D30K, C90S, I93M, and maybe the a-synuclein mutants. But the question is about the variants in UCH-L1. The a-synuclein mutants are mentioned as linked to UCH-L1 secretion, but they might not be the focus here. Let's focus on the UCH-L1 variants.

For D30K: The paper states that D30K UCH-L1 has decreased secretion compared to wild-type. The functional evidence is that secretion is reduced. The protein change is D30K, which is a substitution of aspartic acid to lysine at position 30.

C90S: This variant lacks hydrolase activity. The paper says that C90S UCH-L1 secretion is not decreased. So, the functional evidence here is that secretion is normal compared to wild-type. The protein change is C90S, substituting cysteine to serine at position 90.

I93M: The mutation I93M in UCH-L1 decreases its secretion. The protein change is I93M, substituting isoleucine to methionine at position 93.

Now, the a-synuclein mutants are mentioned as reducing UCH-L1 secretion, but they are not variants in UCH-L1 itself. So, maybe they are not part of the variants we need to assess here. The question is about the variants in UCH-L1, so focus on D30K, C90S, I93M.

Next, I need to apply the ACMG flowchart for each variant.

Starting with D30K:

Step 1: Define the disease mechanism. The paper shows that UCH-L1 is secreted, and mutations affect secretion. The disease is Parkinson's, so the mechanism is related to UCH-L1 secretion. The variant D30K is associated with reduced secretion. So, the disease mechanism is related to UCH-L1's role in secretion, which is linked to PD. So, Step 1 is satisfied.

Step 2: Applicability of assays. The paper uses cell culture experiments to show secretion levels. The general class is secretion assay. The paper's context is about secretion, so this is applicable. So, Step 2 is yes.

Step 3: Validity of assays. The paper mentions that they used D30K and wild-type. They did experiments with these variants. They also mention that the secretion of D30K was decreased. The paper has controls (wild-type) and replicates? The abstract doesn't specify replicates, but the study is on cultured cells, which might be done in triplicate. The paper does mention that the secretion of D30K was decreased compared to wild-type, so there's a control. But the exact number of replicates isn't clear. However, the paper does mention that the secretion was decreased, so maybe they used multiple replicates. So, Step 3a: basic controls (wild-type) and replicates (assuming multiple experiments) are present. So, proceed to Step 3c.

Step 3c: Variant controls. The paper used D30K as a variant and wild-type as control. The D30K is a specific variant, so this is a variant control. So, Step 3c is satisfied.

Proceed to Step 4: Apply evidence to variant. The paper shows that D30K has reduced secretion. So, the functional evidence is that the variant leads to reduced secretion. The paper does not mention statistical analysis (p-values, etc.), but it's a direct comparison. Since the study is on cultured cells, and the results are stated as decreased, the evidence is supporting. So, the strength is PS3_supporting.

Now, for C90S:

Step 1: The paper shows that C90S UCH-L1 secretion is not decreased. The disease mechanism is related to UCH-L1 secretion. The variant's effect is that secretion is normal. So, the disease mechanism is defined.

Step 2: The assay is secretion, so applicable.

Step 3: The paper uses C90S and wild-type. They did experiments, so controls are present. Replicates? Not specified, but the study is on cultured cells, so maybe multiple experiments. So, Step 3a is satisfied.

Step 3c: The control is wild-type, so variant control is present.

Step 4: The paper states that C90S does not decrease secretion, so the evidence is that the variant does not affect secretion. Since the study is showing that the variant is not reduced, this is supporting evidence. However, the paper may not have statistical analysis, so the strength is BS3_supporting.

For I93M:

Step 1: The mutation is associated with reduced secretion, so the disease mechanism is related to UCH-L1's role in secretion.

Step 2: The assay is secretion, so applicable.

Step 3: The paper uses I93M and wild-type. So, controls are present. Replicates? Not specified, but the study is on cultured cells, so maybe multiple experiments. So, Step 3a satisfied.

Step 3c: variant control present.

Step 4: The paper states that I93M decreases secretion. Since the study is on cultured cells, and the result is decreased, the evidence is supporting. But again, no statistical analysis, so PS3_supporting.

Now, the a-synuclein mutants are mentioned, but they are not variants in UCH-L1. So, maybe they are not part of the variants to assess here. The question is about the variants in UCH-L1, so we focus on D30K, C90S, I93M.

So, the answer should include these three variants with their respective functional evidence.
