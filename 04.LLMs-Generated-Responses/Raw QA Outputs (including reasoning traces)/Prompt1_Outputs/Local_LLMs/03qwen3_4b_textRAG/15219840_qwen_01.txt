Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the provided scientific text and extract functional evidence for each variant mentioned, then apply the ACMG flowchart to determine the strength of the evidence.

First, I need to identify all the variants mentioned. The abstract talks about several mutants: L166P, M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S. Wait, the user's question says "each variant mentioned that has functional data." Looking at the text, the functional data is discussed for L166P, M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S. But in the abstract, the main focus is on L166P and M26I, but the other variants are also mentioned. However, the text says that all mutants except L166P made homodimers, and that M26I and L166P were unstable. Also, the cell lines for L166P and C106S had no activity to scavenge ROS. So all these variants have some functional data.

Next, I need to extract the gene, protein change, and variant string ID for each. The gene is DJ-1. The protein changes are:

- L166P: Leucine to Proline at position 166
- M26I: Methionine to Isoleucine at position 26
- R98Q: Arginine to Glutamine at position 98
- D149A: Aspartic acid to Alanine at position 149
- C106S: Cysteine to Serine at position 106

So each variant has these details. Now, for each variant, I need to apply the ACMG steps.

Starting with L166P. The paper states that L166P is a mutant found in Parkinson's patients and that it had no activity to prevent H2O2-induced cell death. Also, it forms heterodimers with wild-type DJ-1 but not homodimers. The cell lines expressing L166P and C106S showed no scavenging of endogenous ROS. So the functional evidence is about cell death prevention and ROS scavenging. The disease mechanism is related to oxidative stress and Parkinson's. The assay used is cell phenotype rescue, looking at cell death and ROS scavenging. The paper mentions that the mutants (including L166P) have reduced activity to eliminate H2O2 and prevent cell death. So the functional assay is assessing the ability to prevent cell death and ROS scavenging. The controls are wild-type DJ-1, and the study used cell lines with these mutants. The paper states that the assays were done with these cell lines. The steps would involve checking if the assays are applicable, then validating the controls, etc.

For each variant, I need to go through the steps. Let's take L166P first. Step 1: The paper defines the disease mechanism as DJ-1's role in oxidative stress and preventing cell death, which is linked to Parkinson's. So the answer here is "Yes". Then, the assay is cell death and ROS scavenging, which is relevant. So step 2 is "Yes". Then, step 3a: did they have controls? The paper mentions that all mutants made heterodimers with wild-type, so wild-type is a control. The cell lines were stably expressing the mutants. The paper also mentions that the experiments were done with these cell lines. The "n" isn't specified, but maybe they used multiple replicates. So step 3a is "Yes". Then step 3c: variant controls? The paper mentions that other mutants were tested, but it's not clear if they used known pathogenic or benign controls. The paper doesn't mention using other variants as controls, so step 3c is "No". Then, step 4a: statistical analysis? The paper doesn't mention p-values or OddsPath, so step 4a is "No". Then step 4b: number of controls. The paper mentions that M26I and L166P are homozygous, but the number of controls isn't specified. So step 4b is "No". So the final strength is Max PS3_supporting.

Wait, but the paper says that the mutants (except L166P) made homodimers. The cell lines for L166P and C106S showed no scavenging. The paper also mentions that the activity to eliminate H2O2 was reduced, except for D149A. So for L166P, the functional evidence is that the mutant has no activity, which is pathogenic. So the strength would be PS3_supporting.

Similarly, for M26I, the paper says that M26I and L166P are unstable and their stabilities are recovered with MG132. The cell lines for L166P and C106S had no activity. So M26I is also a pathogenic variant, so the strength would be PS3_supporting.

For R98Q, the paper mentions that all mutants except L166P made homodimers, but the functional data is not directly given. The text says that M26I and L166P were unstable, but R98Q's functional data isn't described. Wait, the abstract says that the study analyzed other mutants, including M26I, R98Q, and D149A. But the functional data is only mentioned for L166P, M26I, and C106S. Wait, the text says: "the study analyzed other mutants, including M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S. However, the functional data is only given for L166P, M26I, and C106S. R98Q and D149A's functional data is not specified. Wait, the text says that the cell lines for L166P and C106S showed no activity. But for D149A, the text says that the activity to eliminate H2O2 was reduced except for D149A. Wait, the text says: "the cell lines for L166P and C106S showed no activity to scavenge endogenous ROS. The activity to eliminate H2O2 was reduced, except for D149A." So D149A has normal activity? So D149A is benign? But the text doesn't explicitly state that. It's possible that the study found that D149A had normal activity, which would be a benign variant. So for D149A, the functional data is that it has normal activity. So the strength would be BS3_supporting.

But the user's question is about each variant mentioned that has functional data. So R98Q is mentioned, but the functional data is not given. The text says that the study analyzed other mutants, but the functional data is only for L166P, M26I, C106S, and D149A. So R98Q's functional data is not provided. Therefore, for R98Q, there's no functional data, so we can't assign a strength. But the user may have intended all variants mentioned in the text to be considered. However, the text says that the study analyzed these mutants, but the functional data is only given for some. Therefore, for R98Q and D149A, maybe the functional data is present but not explicitly stated. Wait, the text says that the study analyzed other mutants, including M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S. Then, the text says that the cell lines for L166P and C106S showed no activity. The activity to eliminate H2O2 was reduced, except for D149A. So D149A's activity is normal. So for D149A, the functional data is that it has normal activity, which would be benign. So the strength is BS3_supporting. For R98Q, the text doesn't mention any functional data, so it's not included.

So the answer would include L166P, M26I, C106S, and D149A. The other variants (R98Q) don't have functional data. But the user's question says "each variant mentioned that has functional data." So R98Q is not included. So the answer would include those four variants.

Now, applying the ACMG steps for each. Let me go through each variant one by one.

Starting with L166P:

Step 1: Disease mechanism is DJ-1's role in oxidative stress and cell death. The paper says that L166P is a mutant that does not prevent cell death. So yes, the mechanism is defined.

Step 2: The assay is cell death and ROS scavenging. The paper mentions that the mutants (including L166P) have reduced activity. So the assay is applicable.

Step 3a: Controls? The paper uses wild-type DJ-1 as a control. The cell lines were stably expressing the mutants. The study used multiple cell lines. So step 3a is yes.

Step 3c: Variant controls? The paper doesn't mention using other variants as controls, so step 3c is no.

Step 4a: Statistical analysis? The paper doesn't mention p-values or OddsPath. So step 4a is no.

Step 4b: Number of controls? The paper mentions that M26I and L166P are homozygous, but the number of controls isn't specified. So step 4b is no.

So the final strength is Max PS3_supporting.

For M26I:

Same steps. The paper says that M26I and L166P are unstable. The cell lines for these mutants show no activity. So the functional data is that they are unstable and have reduced activity. So the strength is PS3_supporting.

For C106S:

The paper states that the cell lines for L166P and C106S showed no activity to scavenge endogenous ROS. So the functional data is that C106S has no activity. So the strength is PS3_supporting.

For D149A:

The paper says that the activity to eliminate H2O2 was reduced, except for D149A. So D149A has normal activity. So the functional data is that it's normal, which is benign. So the strength is BS3_supporting.

Now, for R98Q, there's no functional data mentioned, so it's not included.

So the answer includes the four variants with the respective strengths.
