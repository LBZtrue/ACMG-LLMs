Alright, I'm trying to extract mutation information from the given literature abstract. Let me read through it carefully.

The abstract starts by talking about E3 ubiquitin ligases and their role in Parkinson's disease. It mentions point mutations in the parkin gene as a common trait. So, parkin is definitely a gene of interest here.

Next, it details two specific mutations: K48A and R42P. These are protein changes. The first mutation, K48A, involves lysine (K) at position 48 being replaced by alanine (A). I should note this as one variant.

The second mutation is R42P, where arginine (R) at position 42 is changed to proline (P). This also needs to be recorded as another variant. 

Looking further, the abstract doesn't mention any cDNA changes or specific transcripts related to these mutations. It only discusses the protein-level effects and structural implications.

I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The gene here is parkin. Each mutation becomes an entry under 'variants'. Since there's no cDNA change mentioned, I'll mark both as "N.D." in that section. 

For each variant:
- K48A: Protein change is from K to A at position 48.
- R42P: Protein change is from R to P at position 42.

Both descriptions are explicitly stated, so they go into the 'Description' field under each variant. I'll make sure not to omit any fields and fill in "N.D." where information isn't available.

I think that's all the mutation info present. No other mutations are discussed, so I don't need additional entries. The output should be accurate and comprehensive based on what's provided.
