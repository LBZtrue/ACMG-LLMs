Okay, so I need to extract mutation information from the given literature abstract. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions a study on fibroblasts from a patient with a homozygous mutation p.W437X in the PINK1 gene. That's one mutation right there. Then, looking further into the mtDNA analysis of the patient, they found two new missense mutations: m.12397A.G (p.T21A) in ND5 and m.14319T.C (p.N119D) in ND6. These are both homoplasmic in the patient and her mother.

So, I can identify four variants here:

1. PINK1 gene with cDNA change not specified but the protein change is p.W437X.
2. ND5 gene with m.12397A.G mutation leading to p.T21A.
3. ND6 gene with m.14319T.C mutation resulting in p.N119D.

I need to structure each variant with their respective cDNA and protein changes, as well as the description from the text. For PINK1, since only the protein change is given, I'll mark the cDNA change fields as N.D. For ND5 and ND6, both cDNA and protein details are provided.

Now, putting this together in the required JSON format with all necessary fields filled out accurately.
