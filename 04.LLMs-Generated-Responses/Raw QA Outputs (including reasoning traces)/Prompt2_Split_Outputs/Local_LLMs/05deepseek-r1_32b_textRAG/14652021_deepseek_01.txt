Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. The user wants me to act as an expert data miner focusing on mutations.

First, I'll read through the abstract and context provided. Let me start by identifying any mention of mutations in the text.

In the abstract, it says: "Mutations in DJ-1 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism (AR-EOP)." So that's a clear mention of DJ-1 gene mutations causing AR-EOP. The next sentence mentions the mechanism isn't fully understood but points out that loss of DJ-1 function causes the phenotype.

Looking further, it talks about downregulating DJ-1 with siRNA and the effects on cell death under various stress conditions. Then there's mention of over-expression of wild-type DJ-1 rescuing cell death caused by hydrogen peroxide. However, the L166P mutant DJ-1 doesn't rescue this, implying that mutation is non-functional.

In the context section, it states that DJ-1 is the second causative gene for AR-EOP (PARK7) and notes that mutations include a large deletion causing loss of DJ-1 protein or function. It also mentions Parkin gene mutations in AR-JP patients but doesn't specify any specific mutations beyond PARK2.

So, compiling this information:

Gene: DJ-1
Variants:
- L166P mutation (protein change)
- Mention of a large deletion causing loss of function

I should structure the JSON accordingly. However, I notice that in the variants array, each entry should include cDNA and protein changes if available. Since only L166P is specified as a protein change without the corresponding cDNA change, I'll mark cDNA details as N.D.

Additionally, there's mention of a large deletion leading to loss of function but no specific variant details, so that would be another entry with N.D. for both cDNA and protein changes.
