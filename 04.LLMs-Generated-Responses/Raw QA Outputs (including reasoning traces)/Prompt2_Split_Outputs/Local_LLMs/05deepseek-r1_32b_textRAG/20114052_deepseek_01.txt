Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a detailed abstract from a medical literature source and wants to extract information related to mutations using the specified JSON format. 

First, I need to carefully read through the abstract to identify any mentions of mutations. Scanning through the text, I notice that there's a specific mention: "E46K linked to a familial form of PD (E46K)." This indicates a mutation in the α-synuclein protein at position 46, where Glutamic acid (E) is replaced by Lysine (K).

Next, I'll break down the extracted information. The gene in question isn't explicitly named beyond "α-syn" or "α-synuclein," but since it's a well-known gene associated with Parkinson's disease, I can safely assume the gene is α-synuclein. 

Looking at the mutation details: E46K refers to an amino acid substitution where Glutamic acid (E) at position 46 is mutated to Lysine (K). There's no mention of cDNA changes or specific transcripts, so I'll mark those as "N.D." in the JSON output.

I also need to ensure that all fields are filled appropriately. The variant section should include any relevant details about the mutation's effect. In this case, it's linked to a familial form of PD, which is an important description.

Since there's only one mutation mentioned (E46K), I'll structure the JSON with a single entry under "variants." Each field that doesn't have corresponding information will be marked as "N.D."

Finally, I need to present this in a clear and structured format without any markdown, just plain text following the specified JSON template. This way, the user can easily parse and utilize the extracted data for further analysis.
