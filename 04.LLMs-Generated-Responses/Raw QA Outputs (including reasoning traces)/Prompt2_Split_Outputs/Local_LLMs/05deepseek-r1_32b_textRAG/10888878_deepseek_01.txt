Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by extracting mutation information from a given paragraph of medical literature. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

The abstract talks about Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) and mentions that mutations in the PARK2 gene cause this condition. It refers to "mutations of which cause AR-JP" but doesn't provide specific details like the type of mutation or where exactly it occurs on the gene. The text also discusses how parkin, the product of the PARK2 gene, functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase and that mutant parkins from patients show loss of this activity.

I need to check if there are any mentions of specific mutations beyond just stating that mutations exist. Looking through the abstract again, I see no cDNA changes or protein alterations described. The focus is more on the function of parkin rather than the specifics of the mutations causing AR-JP.

Since the text only states that mutations in PARK2 cause the disease without giving any further details, there's nothing to extract beyond identifying the gene involved. Therefore, according to the user's requirements, I should note that no specific mutation information is present and return "N.D." for the variant details.

The provided literature abstract discusses mutations in the PARK2 gene causing AR-JP but does not specify any particular cDNA or protein changes. Here is the extracted information:

```json

            },

    ]
}
