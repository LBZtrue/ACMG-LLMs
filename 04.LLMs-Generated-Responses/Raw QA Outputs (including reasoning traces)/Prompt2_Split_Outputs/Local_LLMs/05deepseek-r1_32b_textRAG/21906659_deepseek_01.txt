Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is an expert in medical literature data mining and needs to extract mutation information from a given text. My job is to determine if the provided paragraph contains any mutation details.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. It mentions alpha-synuclein (␣-syn) and talks about its aggregation in Parkinson's disease. Then, it specifically notes the pathogenetic point mutation A30P. This stands out as a clear indication of a mutation being discussed.

Now, I need to extract the relevant details. The gene involved is alpha-synuclein, so the Gene field should be "SNCA" since that's the official symbol for the α-synuclein gene. 

Looking at the variants section, there's only one mentioned: A30P. This refers to an amino acid change from Alanine (A) to Proline (P) at position 30 in the protein. The cDNA change isn't explicitly provided, so I'll mark that as "N.D." since it's not mentioned.

I should also describe this mutation in context. The text calls it a pathogenetic point mutation A30P, which indicates its significance in disease progression.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will include the gene, the variant with protein change and cDNA marked as N.D., and the description from the input. This ensures that all required fields are filled accurately without adding any speculative information.
