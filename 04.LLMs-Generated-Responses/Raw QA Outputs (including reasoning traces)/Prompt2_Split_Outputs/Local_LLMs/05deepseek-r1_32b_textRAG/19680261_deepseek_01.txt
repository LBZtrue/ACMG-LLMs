Okay, I need to extract mutation information from the given text paragraph. Let me read through it carefully.

The abstract mentions DJ-1 and two specific mutations: D149A and L166P. Both are described in the context of their effects on DJ-1 function.

For each mutation, I'll identify the gene (DJ-1), cDNA change (not provided explicitly), protein changes (D149A and L166P), and descriptions from the text.

Since the cDNA changes aren't specified, I'll mark those as "N.D." in the JSON output.

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "D",

                "position": "149"
            },
            "Description in input context": "D149A mutation renders DJ-1 resistant to caspase-6 proteolysis and abolishes its protective phenotype."
        },
