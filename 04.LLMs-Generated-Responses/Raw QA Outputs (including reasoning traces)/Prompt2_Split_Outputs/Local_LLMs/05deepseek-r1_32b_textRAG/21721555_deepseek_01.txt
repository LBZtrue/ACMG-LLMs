Okay, so I'm trying to extract mutation information from the provided literature paragraph. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to spot any mentions of mutations or genetic changes related to α-synuclein.

In the abstract, it says that they compared human and mouse α-synuclein chimeras. They mention two specific substitutions: A53T and S87N. These are likely amino acid changes at positions 53 and 87 in the protein sequence.

Looking further, these substitutions affect aggregation properties. For example, A53T affects growth kinetics, while both A53T and S87N influence the lag phase. The NMR analysis links conformational changes near position 53 to altered growth rates, suggesting that alanine at position 53 in humans might be an evolutionary adaptation against Parkinson's.

Now, mapping these to the JSON structure:

1. **Gene**: Since it's about α-synuclein, I'll note "SNCA" as the gene associated with this protein.
2. **Variants**:
   - **A53T Mutation**:
     - cDNA Change: They didn't specify the transcript or exact nucleotide changes, so I'll put "N.D." for that part.
     - Protein Change: Alanine (A) at position 53 is changed to Threonine (T).
     - Description: The context mentions this mutation's role in growth kinetics and structural changes.
   - **S87N Mutation**:
     - cDNA Change: Again, not detailed in the text.
     - Protein Change: Serine (S) at position 87 is changed to Asparagine (N).
     - Description: This substitution affects the lag phase when combined with A53T.

I need to ensure that all fields are filled as per instructions. If a part isn't mentioned, I'll use "N.D." appropriately.
