Alright, I need to analyze the given medical literature text to extract information related to mutations. Let's start by reading through the abstract and introduction carefully.

In the abstract, it mentions that LRRK2 is a causal gene for familial Parkinson's disease. Specifically, they discuss an I2020T mutant LRRK2 which has higher susceptibility to post-translational degradation compared to wild-type. The study shows that this mutation impairs the protective effect against apoptosis and suggests that its higher degradation might be involved in neurodegeneration.

Moving on to the introduction, it provides more context about LRRK2. It states that patients in the Sagamihara family have the I2020T mutation in the kinase domain of LRRK2. Up to 23 different mutations in various domains have been reported globally. These mutations are linked to Parkinson's disease with similar clinical features as sporadic cases.

Now, focusing on extracting mutation details. The key mutation mentioned is I2020T. It occurs in the kinase domain and affects LRRK2 function by increasing degradation susceptibility, leading to impaired protective effects against apoptosis.

I need to structure this information according to the specified JSON format. The gene here is clearly LRRK2. There's one variant discussed: I2020T. However, the text doesn't provide cDNA change details like transcript or nucleotide position, so those will be marked as N.D. The protein change is from Isoleucine (I) to Threonine (T) at position 2020.

There's also a mention of other mutations in various domains but without specific details, so they aren't included here. Therefore, the variants array only contains the I2020T mutation.
