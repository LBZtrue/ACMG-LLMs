Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. The user is a professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert looking to extract mutation information from a given text. They want the output in a specific JSON format.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. It's about LRRK2 gene mutations linked to parkinsonian symptoms. The abstract mentions Y1699C and G2019S mutants causing loss of function. In the introduction, they also refer to Y1699C and R1441C mutants.

I need to identify each mutation's details: Gene name is clear, LRRK2. For each variant, I extract cDNA Change if available. But in this case, only protein changes are mentioned without specific cDNA positions or transcripts. So, the "cDNA Change" field will be "N.D.".

For Protein Changes, Y1699C means tyrosine to cysteine at position 1699. G2019S is glycine to serine at 2019, and R1441C is arginine to cysteine at 1441.

I structure the JSON with these details, ensuring each variant is listed under "variants". Since some fields like transcript aren't provided, I fill them with "N.D." as per instructions.

Finally, I review to make sure all required fields are present and accurate. Everything seems in order, so the final answer should correctly reflect the extracted mutation information.
