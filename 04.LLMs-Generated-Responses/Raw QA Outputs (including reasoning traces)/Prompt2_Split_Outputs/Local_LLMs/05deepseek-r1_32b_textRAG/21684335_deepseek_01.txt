Alright, I need to extract mutation information from the provided text. Let me read through it carefully.

The abstract mentions mutations such as E46K, A30P, and A53T in the αS gene causing autosomal dominant LBD. These are specific protein changes. The introduction doesn't mention any additional mutations beyond what's already stated.

Looking at the structure, each mutation affects different aspects of α-synuclein aggregation. I'll need to map these mutations to their respective genes and describe their effects.

Since no cDNA or transcript information is provided, those fields will be marked as "N.D." Each variant will have its protein change noted, along with a brief description from the context.
