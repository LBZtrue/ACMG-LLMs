Alright, I'm looking at the query and trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given literature text. The user provided a paragraph that talks about PINK1 gene mutations in PARK6-linked Parkinson's disease (PD). My task is to identify if there are any specific mutations mentioned and extract the relevant details.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. It mentions "PINK1 gene mutations" right at the beginning, which definitely indicates that mutations are a topic here. However, when I look further into the text, it discusses the localization of PINK1 protein to Lewy bodies and other cellular mechanisms but doesn't specify any particular cDNA or protein changes.

In the context provided, Valente et al. (2004b) are cited in relation to PINK1 mutations. The abstract also refers back to previous work by Valente et al. (2004a) about mitochondrial localization. However, none of these sources provide detailed mutation information like specific cDNA changes or amino acid substitutions.

I should check if there's any mention of variants, such as SNPs or indels, but I don't see anything like that. The focus seems more on the protein's behavior and cellular processes rather than genetic mutations themselves. Since no specific mutations are mentioned beyond the general term "mutations," I can't extract exact details.

Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if there's no specific mutation information, I should return "N.D." for all fields except acknowledging that PINK1 is the gene associated with PD mutations.
