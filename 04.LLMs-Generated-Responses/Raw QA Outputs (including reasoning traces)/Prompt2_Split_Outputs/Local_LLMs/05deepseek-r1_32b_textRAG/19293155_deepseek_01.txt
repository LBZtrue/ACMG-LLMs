Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to extract mutation information from a given paragraph of medical literature. The user is an expert in data mining, so they need precise and accurate extraction without any assumptions.

First, I'll scan through the abstract to identify any mentions of mutations. It starts by talking about genomic deletions and the L166P point mutation related to Parkinson's disease. That's a clear mutation, DJ-1 gene with protein change from Leu to Pro at position 166.

Next, there's mention of the M26I mutation reducing DJ-1 expression. So that's another variant in the DJ-1 gene, changing Methionine to Isoleucine at position 26. The text also discusses other mutations like C106A, which affects binding and activity, so that's a third variant.

Then, there are peripheral cysteine mutants: C46A and C53A. These are additional variants in DJ-1, impacting the protein's function by altering specific residues. Lastly, they mention a designed mutation, C106DD, which mimics higher-order oxidation but isn't found in nature.

I need to extract each of these mutations accurately, noting their gene, cDNA changes if available, and protein changes. Since some details like cDNA positions aren't provided, I'll mark those as "N.D." The descriptions should be taken directly from the text without adding any extra information.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each variant listed under DJ-1, including their respective mutations and descriptions. I ensure that all fields are filled, using "N.D." where necessary to maintain completeness.
