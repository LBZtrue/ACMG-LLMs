Okay, I need to extract mutation information from the provided literature paragraphs. Let me start by reading through the abstract and introduction carefully.

In the abstract, it mentions several LRRK2 mutations: G2019S is the most common in general, while G2385R is more frequent in Asia. They also studied Y1699C. These variants are linked to dopaminergic neuron loss and other deficits in flies.

Looking at the introduction, it confirms that LRRK2 mutations are a significant cause of parkinsonism and notes that many such mutations have been identified.

So, I'll extract each mutation with their gene, cDNA change (if mentioned), protein change, and context description. Since the literature doesn't provide transcript info or reference alleles for cDNA, those will be marked as N.D. The protein changes are clear: G2019S affects position 2019, Y1699C at 1699, and G2385R at 2385.

I'll structure this into the specified JSON format, making sure all fields are included even if some data is N.D.
