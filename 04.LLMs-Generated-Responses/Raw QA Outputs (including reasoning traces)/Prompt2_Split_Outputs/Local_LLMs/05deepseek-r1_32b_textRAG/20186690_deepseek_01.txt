Alright, I need to extract mutation information from the provided literature abstract and introduction. Let me start by carefully reading through each section.

Looking at the abstract, I see mentions of several polymorphic LRRK2 variants associated with Parkinson disease (PD) among Chinese patients. The first variant is rs34778348:G4A; p.G2385R, which stands for a change from guanine to adenine in cDNA at position 4, leading to an arginine substitution at codon 2385 in the protein. The second variant mentioned is rs33949390:G4C; p.R1628P, indicating a guanine-to-cytosine change causing a proline substitution at position 1628.

Additionally, there's discussion about other variants like rs7133914:G4C; p.R1398H and rs7308720:C4A: p.N551K. The abstract explains how these variants modify the risk of PD when present together or in combination with others.

Moving on to the introduction, it mentions that LRRK2 mutations account for a significant percentage of familial and sporadic PD cases. It references studies showing that some common mutations may have varying effects, but the specific details about these mutations are not explicitly provided beyond their association with PD.

Putting this together, I can extract the four specific variants discussed in the abstract. For each variant, I'll note the gene (LRRK2), the cDNA change with its reference and alternate alleles along with position, the protein change with its before and after amino acids, and a brief description from the text. Variants not mentioned elsewhere are supplemented with "N.D." where necessary.

I need to ensure that all four variants are included accurately in the JSON format without omitting any fields. Each variant should have its own entry under the 'variants' array within the JSON structure.
