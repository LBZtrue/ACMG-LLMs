Alright, I'm looking at the provided literature abstract to extract mutation information. The key points mention mutations in the PINK1 gene, specifically in three regions: N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain. However, there's no detailed cDNA or protein change information given.

First, I'll note that the gene involved is PINK1. Next, I need to check if any specific mutations are described beyond their locations. The abstract doesn't provide exact positions or amino acid changes, just mentions of the regions affected.

Since the user requires extracting only what's explicitly stated, and there's no cDNA or protein change details, those sections will be marked as "N.D." I'll structure the JSON accordingly, listing each mutation area without specific data where applicable.

```json
{
    "Gene": "PINK1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "mutations in the gene encoding PINK1, specifically N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain mutants"
        }
    ]
}
