Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants to extract mutation information using the specified JSON format. My role is to act as an expert in data mining medical literature.

First, I need to read through the context carefully. The abstract discusses three familial variants of the R-synuclein (RS) protein: A30P, E46K, and A53T, all linked to Parkinson's disease. These are mutations where specific amino acids have been altered—alanine to proline at position 30, glutamic acid to lysine at 46, and alanine to threonine at 53.

Next, I check if the input text contains any mutation-related terms or descriptions. The abstract explicitly mentions these three mutations (A30P, E46K, A53T) along with their effects on lipid binding properties compared to wild-type RS. This confirms that mutation information is present.

Now, I need to extract specific details about each variant. However, the given paragraph doesn't provide the cDNA changes or transcript information—only the protein changes are described. Therefore, for each variant, the cDNA change section will be marked as "N.D."

The abstract mentions the effects of these mutations on lipid binding, so I'll include a brief description in the context field.

I also need to ensure that all fields in the JSON structure are filled appropriately. Since there's no mention of transcript information or other details like clinical significance, those sections will be marked as "N.D." where necessary.

Finally, I compile this information into the specified JSON format, ensuring completeness and accuracy based on the provided context.
