Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is a professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert looking to extract mutation information from a given text paragraph. My role here is to simulate the thought process of an expert before providing the structured JSON response.

First, I'll start by carefully reading the input text to identify any mentions of mutations or related terms. Scanning through the abstract and introduction sections provided, I notice several key points. The abstract specifically mentions "mutations of the mitochondrial PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) induced kinase1 (PINK1)" as important causes of recessive Parkinson disease (PD). This indicates that mutations in the PINK1 gene are a focus of the study.

Next, I look for specific details about these mutations. The text states that both "loss of function" and "overexpression" implicate PINK1 in various phenotypes like apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. It also mentions "clinical mutations," which suggests that these mutations have been identified in patient studies. However, the paragraph doesn't provide explicit cDNA or protein change details, such as specific nucleotide changes (e.g., c.248G>A) or amino acid substitutions (e.g., p.G83D).

The study uses fruit fly and mouse models to demonstrate how PINK1 deficiency or clinical mutations affect Complex I function in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This leads to mitochondrial depolarization and increased apoptotic sensitivity, further supporting the role of PINK1 mutations in PD pathogenesis. Importantly, it's noted that wild-type PINK1 can rescue Complex I deficiency but not when carrying clinical mutations.

From this analysis, I can confirm that the text discusses mutations in the PINK1 gene related to Parkinson disease. However, there are no specific cDNA or protein change details provided. Therefore, while extracting mutation information is possible, some fields will be marked as "N.D." since they aren't explicitly mentioned in the text.

Now, considering the JSON structure required, I'll map the extracted information accordingly. The gene is clearly PINK1. Since no specific variants are detailed beyond the general mention of mutations and clinical cases, the 'variants' array will note that such details are not provided (N.D.). Similarly, without transcript or position specifics, those fields remain as N.D.

In summary, while the text provides significant information about the role of PINK1 mutations in PD, it lacks detailed variant descriptions. My task is to accurately reflect this in the JSON output, ensuring completeness by supplementing missing details with "N.D." where necessary.
