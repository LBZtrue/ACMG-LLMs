Okay, I'm looking at this query where the user wants to extract mutation information from a given paragraph of medical literature. The goal is to determine if there are any mutations mentioned and, if so, pull out specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and their descriptions.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. It's an abstract discussing the PARK2 gene and its role in both Parkinson's disease and cancer. The text mentions "inactivating somatic mutations" and "frequent intragenic deletions" of PARK2 in human malignancies. That definitely sounds like mutation information.

Next, I'll identify the specific details. The gene involved is clearly stated as PARK2. Now, looking for cDNA changes or protein changes—I notice that the context mentions "cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects," but it doesn't provide exact cDNA or protein changes. It talks about domains and residues where mutations occur similarly to those causing Parkinson's, but without specifics.

Since there are no detailed cDNA or protein changes mentioned, I'll mark those as "N.D." in the JSON response. The description field will include the information that PARK2 has inactivating somatic mutations and deletions in cancer, which affect its function and lead to mitotic instability.

I also need to ensure the JSON structure is complete, with all required fields present. Even though some parts aren't specified, using "N.D." keeps the response accurate and comprehensive as per the user's instructions.
