Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is an expert in medical literature data mining and needs to extract information about mutations from a given paragraph.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. The abstract discusses Parkinson disease (PD), focusing on iron homeostasis and its role in neuronal death. It mentions SH-SY5Y cells expressing DMT1 along with wild type or mutant α-synuclein.

I notice that the term "mutant α-synuclein" is used, which suggests a mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA). However, the text doesn't specify the exact variant—no cDNA or protein changes are detailed. This means while there's mention of a mutation, the specifics aren't provided.

Next, I'll structure my response according to the user's instructions. Since mutations are mentioned but without details like cDNA or protein changes, those fields should be marked as "N.D." The JSON format requires all these fields, so it's crucial to fill in what's available and note where information is missing.

I also need to ensure that the output strictly follows the specified JSON structure. This includes including all necessary keys even if some values are not provided. By doing this, the user gets a clear and complete response despite missing details.

Finally, I'll double-check that the extracted information accurately reflects what's present in the literature without adding any assumptions or speculations. This maintains the integrity of the data extraction process.
