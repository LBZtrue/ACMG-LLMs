Okay, so I'm looking at this query where the user is an expert in analyzing literature data, specifically focused on extracting information related to mutations from medical texts. The goal here is to determine if the given text contains any mutation details and extract them accordingly.

First, I'll start by reading through the provided context thoroughly. The abstract mentions that mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease. It also talks about pathogenic mutations increasing the tendency of dardarin to form inclusion bodies and leading to cell death. However, it doesn't specify any particular cDNA or protein changes. 

Moving on to the introduction section, it again refers to dominant mutations in LRRK2 but without detailing specific variations. There's mention of post-mortem findings related to Lewy bodies and tau deposits, but nothing about the mutation specifics.

So, based on this analysis, while there are mentions of mutations causing PD and their effects, there isn't any explicit cDNA or protein change details provided in the text. Therefore, according to the user's guidelines, I should extract only what's explicitly stated and fill in "N.D." where information is missing.
