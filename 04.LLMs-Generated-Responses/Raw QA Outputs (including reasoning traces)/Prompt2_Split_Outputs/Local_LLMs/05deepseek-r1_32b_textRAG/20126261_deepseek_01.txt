Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given medical literature paragraph contains any information about mutations and extract relevant details if it does. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. The abstract talks about loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and Parkin causing parkinsonism in humans and mitochondrial dysfunction in model organisms. It also mentions that Parkin is recruited to damaged mitochondria for autophagy but how it recognizes them isn't known. Then there's discussion about PINK1 expression being regulated by voltage-dependent proteolysis on healthy versus damaged mitochondria, leading to Parkin recruitment. Disease-causing mutations in both genes disrupt Parkin recruitment and mitophagy at different steps.

Moving on to the introduction, it mentions Parkinson disease with no available disease-modifying therapy. It refers to recessive familial forms due to mutations in Parkin or PINK1. Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to the pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson disease, especially noting a higher mtDNA mutation rate in the substantia nigra compared to other brain regions.

Now, looking for explicit mentions of mutations:

1. In the abstract: "loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and Parkin" – this directly states that these genes have loss-of-function mutations.
2. Later in the abstract: "disease-causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt..." – again, specific mention of mutations causing disease.

In the introduction: mentions mtDNA mutation rates being higher in SN, but not specific mutations related to PINK1 or Parkin.

So, from the given text, there are clear references to mutations in PINK1 and Parkin genes. However, the context doesn't provide detailed information about specific cDNA changes (like c.248G>A) or protein changes (like p.G83D). It only mentions that loss-of-function mutations cause parkinsonism and disrupt processes.

Given this, I can extract that PINK1 and Parkin have mutations causing the described effects but don't have specifics on cDNA or protein changes. Therefore, in the JSON output, Gene would be "PINK1" and "Parkin", and variants would note that mutations exist without specific details, hence using "N.D." for missing fields.

I also need to ensure that all required fields are present, supplementing with "N.D." where information isn't provided. The structure should include the gene names and their respective variant details, even if some parts are not specified in the input text.
