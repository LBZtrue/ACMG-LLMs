Alright, so I need to analyze this paragraph about LRRK2 mutations and extract the mutation information. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The abstract mentions that autosomal dominant mutations in the human Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are a common cause of Parkinson disease (PD). It specifically notes that these mutations account for up to 7% of familial PD and a significant fraction of sporadic cases. 

Then, it talks about the most prevalent mutation being G2019S, which is responsible for about 40% of familial PD in North African Arabs and up to 30% in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. So that's definitely a key mutation here.

Looking further, I don't see any other specific mutations mentioned beyond G2019S. The paragraph discusses the structure and function of the LRRK2 protein but doesn't list additional mutations or their details like cDNA changes or protein positions.

So, based on what's provided, I can extract that there are mutations in the LRRK2 gene, specifically the G2019S mutation. However, the paragraph doesn't give more detailed information about other variants or specific cDNA and protein changes beyond this one.

Since only one mutation is mentioned, I'll structure my JSON accordingly, listing G2019S under variants with the description provided. The rest of the fields that aren't specified will be marked as "N.D." to indicate they're not discussed in the text.
