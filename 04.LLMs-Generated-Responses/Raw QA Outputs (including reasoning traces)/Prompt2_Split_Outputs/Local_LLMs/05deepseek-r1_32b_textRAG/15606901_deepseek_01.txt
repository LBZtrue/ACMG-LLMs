Alright, so I need to extract mutation information from the provided abstract about Parkin and Parkinson's disease. Let me read through it carefully.

The abstract mentions that a wide variety of parkin mutations have been identified in patients. It then describes two types of mutants: C-terminal deletions and N-terminal missense mutations within the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL). 

For the C-terminal deletion, the effect is loss of membrane association leading to misfolding and aggregation. For the N-terminal mutations, there are four missense changes in the UBL that reduce parkin stability, causing rapid proteasomal degradation.

The abstract doesn't specify the exact cDNA or protein changes; it just describes the types of mutations (deletion and missense) and their locations (C-terminus and N-terminal UBL). Also, there's mention of a smaller 42 kDa parkin species due to an internal start site lacking the N-terminal UBL.

So, I can extract that there are C-terminal deletions and four N-terminal missense mutations. However, specific cDNA or protein changes aren't provided, so those fields will be marked as "N.D.".
