Okay, so I need to analyze the given literature paragraph and extract information related to mutations. Let's go step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract provided to identify any mentions of mutations. The text talks about resistin forms and adiponectin, but that doesn't seem relevant here. Then it shifts focus to Parkinson's disease (PD) and mentions a familial form linked to chromosome 1p36 (PARK6). 

The next part states that mutations in PINK1 are associated with PARK6. It goes on to describe two specific mutations: one is a truncating nonsense mutation, which I know leads to a premature stop codon, and the other is a missense mutation at a highly conserved amino acid. These details indicate changes in the DNA sequence (cDNA) leading to altered proteins.

I need to extract the gene name, which is PINK1. For each variant, I should note the type of change. The first mutation is a nonsense mutation; however, there's no specific cDNA or protein position mentioned beyond it being in the kinase domain and affecting a highly conserved amino acid. 

Since the literature doesn't provide exact nucleotide positions (like c.###X>Y) or specific amino acid changes (p.XYZ), I can only note that mutations exist without detailed information. Therefore, for each variant, I'll mark "N.D." where specifics aren't provided.

So, compiling this into JSON format: the gene is PINK1 with two variants, each lacking cDNA and protein change details but described as a truncating nonsense mutation and a missense mutation at a conserved site.
