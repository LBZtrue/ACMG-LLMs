Alright, I need to extract mutation information from the given literature abstract and introduction. Let's break it down step by step.

First, reading through the abstract:

- The background mentions that mutations in LRRK2 are a cause of inherited and some sporadic PD.
- In the methodology section, they discuss phosphorylation sites on LRRK2 but no mutations here.
- Under conclusions, they mention common PD-related mutations: R1441G, Y1699C, G2019S.

Looking at these mutation names:

R1441G: This is a substitution where Arginine (R) at position 1441 is replaced by Glycine (G).
Y1699C: Tyrosine (Y) at 1699 becomes Cysteine (C).
G2019S: Glycine (G) at 2019 turns into Serine (S).

The abstract doesn't provide cDNA changes, only protein-level alterations. So for each variant:

- Gene is LRRK2.
- Each has a Protein Change with ref, alt, and position.
- cDNA Change details are not mentioned, so they'll be marked as N.D.

Since there's no mention of transcripts or specific cDNA positions, those fields stay as "N.D.".

Now, structuring the JSON:

- Gene: LRRK2
- variants array with three objects:
  - Each has Protein Change filled in.
  - cDNA Change all set to N.D. since not provided.
  - Description in input context is each mutation name as stated.

I think that's comprehensive and follows the required format. Double-checking to ensure no fields are omitted and everything aligns with the user's instructions.
