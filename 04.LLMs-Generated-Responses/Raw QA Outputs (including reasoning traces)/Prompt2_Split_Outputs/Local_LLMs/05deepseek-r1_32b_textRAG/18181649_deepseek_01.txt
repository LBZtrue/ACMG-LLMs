Alright, let me try to figure out how to extract the mutation information from this literature paragraph. So, the user wants me to act as an expert data miner looking for mutations in medical text. The input is a detailed abstract about DJ-1 protein and its role in Parkinsonism.

First, I need to carefully read through the paragraph to identify any mentions of gene names or specific mutations. The abstract starts by talking about missense mutations in DJ-1 that are implicated in familial Parkinsonism. Missense mutations are changes in a single nucleotide that result in a different amino acid, so that's definitely mutation-related.

Looking further, the best-characterized mutation is L166P. This notation tells me that at position 166 in the protein, the amino acid Leucine (L) has been replaced by Proline (P). That's a clear protein-level change. The abstract also mentions other mutations: A104T, E163K, and M26I. Each of these follows the same pattern—amino acid at position in the protein.

For each mutation listed, I need to extract the gene name if provided. In this case, all mutations are in DJ-1. However, the abstract doesn't specify the transcript or cDNA changes; it only provides protein-level changes. So for "cDNA Change," I'll have to put "N.D." as per instructions.

Next, each variant should be listed under "variants" with their respective details. Each mutation gets its own entry in the array. For example, L166P would have a ref of L and alt of P at position 166. Similarly, A104T has Alanine to Threonine at position 104.

The abstract also mentions that these mutations affect thermal stability and structural integrity without major folding defects or loss of dimerization. This is important context but isn't part of the mutation details we're extracting, so it doesn't go into the JSON.

I need to make sure I capture all four mutations: L166P, A104T, E163K, and M26I. Each should be structured with their respective protein changes and descriptions as they appear in the text. Since there's no cDNA information provided, those fields remain "N.D."

Finally, I'll format everything into the specified JSON structure, ensuring that all necessary fields are present and correctly filled. No omissions allowed; every piece of mutation info must be included accurately.
