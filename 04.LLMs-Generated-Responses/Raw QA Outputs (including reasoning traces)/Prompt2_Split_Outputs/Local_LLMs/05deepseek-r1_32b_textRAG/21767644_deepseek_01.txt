Okay, I need to help extract information related to mutations from the given literature abstract. Let me start by carefully reading through the text.

The abstract begins by mentioning that mutations in the N-terminus of the gene encoding α-synuclein (α-syn) are linked to autosomal dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). So, this clearly indicates a mutation related to PD. The specific mutation mentioned here is in the N-terminus of the α-syn gene.

Next, I notice that further down in the abstract, there's a discussion about the mutant A30P α-syn expression. This seems important because it specifies a particular type of mutation—the substitution at position 30 from alanine (A) to proline (P). So, this is another specific mutation being studied.

Now, I need to structure this information into the specified JSON format. The main gene here is α-synuclein, which should be listed under "Gene". There are two mutations mentioned: one in general terms as N-terminus mutations and another specific A30P mutation.

For the first variant, since it's a general mention without specific cDNA or protein changes provided beyond being in the N-terminus, I'll note that. The second variant is more detailed—A30P substitution. However, the abstract doesn't provide the exact cDNA change (like c.XX) corresponding to this protein change.

So, under "variants", I should list each mutation with their details. For the first variant, as there's no specific cDNA or protein change given beyond being in the N-terminus, I'll note that in the description and leave other fields as N.D. For the second variant, A30P, I have a protein change but no cDNA info, so again, those fields will be N.D.

I need to ensure that all fields are filled correctly, using "N.D." where information isn't provided. Also, make sure not to omit any required JSON structure parts.

Wait, looking back at the example given by the user, each variant should have a cDNA Change and Protein Change section with their respective details or N.D. So for the first mutation in the abstract (general N-terminus), I don't have specific changes beyond that area, so all fields under variants will be N.D., except the description.

For the second mutation (A30P), it's a protein change where alanine is replaced by proline at position 30. The cDNA change isn't specified here, so that part remains N.D.

Putting it all together, the JSON should reflect these two variants with their respective details and any missing info as N.D.
