Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is an expert in medical literature data mining and needs to extract mutation information from a given text paragraph. 

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. The abstract discusses mutations of the parkin gene related to juvenile Parkinson's disease (AR-JP). It mentions several key points about parkin's role as a p53 repressor and how different mutations affect this function.

I need to identify any mutation-related terms or descriptions. The text refers to "familial parkin mutations" and describes specific effects, such as abolishing ligase activity or DNA binding. These mutations are associated with AR-JP and enhance p53 expression in affected brains.

However, upon closer inspection, the paragraph doesn't provide explicit details like cDNA changes (e.g., c.248G>A) or protein-level alterations (e.g., p.G83D). It mentions that these mutations either abolish or preserve ligase activity but doesn't specify the exact genetic or protein changes.

Given the output requirements, if specific mutation details aren't present, I should return "N.D." for those fields. So, in this case, while there are mentions of mutations and their effects on parkin function, the necessary detailed information isn't provided to populate the cDNA Change or Protein Change sections accurately.

Therefore, the extracted JSON will include placeholders with "N.D." for these unspecified details, ensuring completeness without fabricating data.
