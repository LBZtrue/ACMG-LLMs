Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is a professional medical literature data mining expert looking to extract mutation information from the provided abstract. They want a JSON output that includes specific details like gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions of mutations.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully to identify any mention of mutations. It starts by saying "Mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause late-onset PD." So, we know there's a focus on LRRK2 mutations related to Parkinson's disease.

Next, I look for specific mutations mentioned. The abstract lists several:
- G2019S
- R1941H
- I2012T
- I2020T
- G2385R
- R1441C
- R1441G
- Y1699C
- T2356I

Each of these is a mutation in the LRRK2 gene. Now, I need to extract details about each. The abstract describes how some mutations stimulate kinase activity (like G2019S), while others inhibit it or show no effect.

For each mutation, I'll note:
- Gene: LRRK2
- cDNA Change: Not mentioned in the abstract, so N.D.
- Protein Change: The amino acid change as listed (e.g., G to S for G2019S)
- Description in input context: The specific effect or finding related to each mutation.

I should structure this into a JSON format with all required fields. For cDNA Change and any other missing details, I'll use "N.D." as per the instructions.

It's important to ensure accuracy and completeness. Since the abstract provides detailed effects for each mutation but lacks cDNA specifics, my JSON will reflect that while still capturing all available data.
