Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is an expert in medical literature data mining and needs to extract mutation information from a given text paragraph. They've provided the context and the question, so my job is to analyze the content carefully.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction sections provided. The main focus here is on Parkinson's Disease (PD) and the role of the PINK1 gene. The abstract mentions that mutations in PINK1 cause recessive familial PD. That’s a clear indicator that there are mutations involved, but it doesn't provide specific details about the types or locations of these mutations.

Looking further into the introduction, there's more detail about PINK1 being a 581 amino acid protein with various domains and some studies on its localization. However, no specific mutations like cDNA changes or protein alterations are mentioned here either. The information is more general, discussing the gene's structure and its association with PD rather than detailing particular mutations.

Since the user specifically wants to extract mutation-related information, I need to check if any specifics are provided. The abstract states that PINK1 mutations cause PD but doesn't list any particular changes or describe them beyond their functional impact (mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage). Similarly, the introduction elaborates on the gene's role without delving into specific mutations.

Given this, there's no explicit mention of cDNA changes or protein changes in the provided text. Therefore, I can conclude that while PINK1 mutations are implicated in PD, the literature doesn't provide detailed mutation data in the given context.

So, structuring my JSON output as per the user's requirements, I'll note that the gene is PINK1 and include "N.D." for all variant details since they aren't specified. This ensures the response is accurate and adheres to the format requested.
