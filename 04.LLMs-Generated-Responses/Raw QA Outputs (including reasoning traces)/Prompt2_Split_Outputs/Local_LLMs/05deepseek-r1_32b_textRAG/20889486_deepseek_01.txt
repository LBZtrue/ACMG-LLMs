Okay, I'm going to tackle this query step by step. The user is an expert in analyzing medical literature and needs help extracting mutation information from a given paragraph. My goal is to determine if the text contains any mutations and then extract specific details.

First, I'll read through the provided abstract and introduction carefully. The abstract mentions "Parkin RING domain mutant (C289G)" which clearly indicates a mutation in the Parkin gene. This is an important point because it's directly related to the user's request about extracting mutations.

Next, I need to identify all the relevant details. The gene here is Parkin, so that fills in the "Gene" field. Looking at the mutation itself, it's described as C289G. In this context, 'C' stands for cysteine and 'G' stands for glycine. The position is 289, which refers to the amino acid position in the protein.

I also notice that the mutation leads to issues with mitophagy and aggregation of Parkin. This provides additional context about the mutation's effects but isn't part of the extraction criteria since we're only focusing on specific details like gene name, cDNA change, protein change, etc.

Now, checking for any cDNA changes: The text doesn't mention any nucleotide-level changes, so that field should be marked as "N.D." Similarly, there's no information about whether this is a germline or somatic mutation, so those fields will also be "N.D."

Putting it all together, the extracted information includes the gene name "Parkin," and under variants, we have the protein change from cysteine to glycine at position 289. All other unspecified fields are filled with "N.D." as per the user's instructions.

I need to make sure I adhere strictly to the JSON format specified, ensuring that all required fields are present even if their content is "N.D." This way, the response remains complete and structured as required by the user.
