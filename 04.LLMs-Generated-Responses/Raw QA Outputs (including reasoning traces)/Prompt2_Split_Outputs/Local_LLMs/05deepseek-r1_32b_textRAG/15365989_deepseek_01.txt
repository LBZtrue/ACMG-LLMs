Alright, I need to process this query about extracting mutation information from a given text. The user is an expert in literature data mining and wants accurate extraction without any speculation.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. It mentions mutations in the parkin gene causing early-onset PD. Then, it talks about DJ1 (PARK7) with two known mutations leading to EOPD. In their analysis of 104 patients, they found a third mutation: c.192G4C (p.E64D).

So, I'll note the gene as DJ1/PARK7. The variant has a cDNA change at position 192, G to C. The protein change is E to D at position 64. The description in the text matches this.

Next, the patient was Turkish and had reduced dopamine uptake. His sister was homozygous but asymptomatic, while his brother heterozygous showed less reduction. So, that's relevant context for the mutation.

Also, there are functional notes: the mutation doesn't change DJ1 structure but shows lower protein levels when overexpressed. Some cells show nuclear localization compared to wild-type.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with gene, variants, and include the family history as part of the description. Since other fields like transcript aren't mentioned, they stay as N.D.
