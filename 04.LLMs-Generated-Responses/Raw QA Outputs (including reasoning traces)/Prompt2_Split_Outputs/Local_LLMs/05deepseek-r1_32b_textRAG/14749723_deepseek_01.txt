Okay, so I need to extract mutation information from this paragraph about DJ-1 and Parkinson's disease. Let me read through it carefully.

The abstract mentions that deletion and point mutations of DJ-1 are responsible for familial PD (PARK7). Specifically, there's a point mutation described as L166P. So the gene here is DJ-1.

Looking at the variants section, I need to list each variant with its details. For this case, it's just one variant. The cDNA change isn't explicitly given in the text; it only mentions the protein change from Leucine (L) to Proline (P) at position 166. So for cDNA Change, I'll put "N.D." since that information isn't provided.

In the Protein Change section, the reference amino acid is L at position 166, and the alternate is P. The description in the input context is given as L166P, so I'll note that.

I should make sure to structure this correctly in JSON format without any markdown. Also, double-checking that all fields are present even if some info isn't available, using "N.D." where necessary.

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "L",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "166"
            },
            "Description in input context": "point (L166P) mutations of DJ-1"
        }
    ]
}
```
