Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from this given text. Let's see... The abstract talks about mutations in the DJ-1 gene causing parkinsonism. They mention a novel pathogenic homozygous missense mutation resulting in L10P substitution and another deletion mutation P158DEL. 

So, first, I need to identify the genes involved. It's clearly DJ-1 here. Next, for each variant, I should note the cDNA changes if mentioned. Wait, the text doesn't provide specific cDNA positions like c.XX or anything; it just states the amino acid substitutions and deletions. So for both variants, the cDNA Change would be N.D.

Then, looking at the protein changes: L10P means Leucine at position 10 is changed to Proline, so ref is G (Leucine's one-letter code), alt is D (Proline). Position is 10. Similarly, P158DEL is a deletion of Phenylalanine at position 158. So here, it's an amino acid deletion, which in the format would be ref as F and alt as DEL.

I also need to include a description from the input context for each variant. The first mutation is described as "L10P" and the second as "P158DEL". 

Putting this together, I'll structure each variant with their respective details. Since cDNA changes aren't provided, those fields are N.D. but all protein change details are extracted.

I should make sure not to include any information that isn't explicitly stated. For example, the abstract mentions other effects of these mutations, like reduced stability and dimerization issues, but I don't need to extract that since it's beyond the mutation information.

So, summarizing: two variants in DJ-1 gene with their protein changes and descriptions. The JSON should reflect this accurately without adding any speculative data.
