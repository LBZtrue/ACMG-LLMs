Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is an expert in medical literature data mining and needs to extract mutation information from a given text. My role is to help them parse through the provided context effectively.

First, I'll start by carefully reading the input text paragraph. It seems to be about mutations in PINK1 and parkin genes related to Parkinson's disease (PD). The abstract mentions that mutations in these genes cause autosomal recessive PD but doesn't specify the exact types of mutations or their locations in the DNA or proteins.

Next, I need to identify any mutation-related terms. The text talks about "homozygous mutations" and "pathogenic PINK1 mutations," which indicates that mutations are present. However, it doesn't provide specifics like cDNA changes or protein alterations. Without these details, I can't fill in the variants section accurately.

Given this, I'll structure the JSON response accordingly. The gene names mentioned are PINK1 and parkin, so those will be listed. Since there's no detailed mutation information provided beyond their mention as causes of PD, the 'variants' array remains empty. All other fields not specified in the input will be marked as "N.D." to maintain completeness.

I should also ensure that the JSON format is strictly followed and that all required fields are included without any omissions. This way, the user gets a clear and structured output that accurately reflects the information present in the text.

Finally, I'll double-check my extraction to make sure no relevant mutation details were overlooked. Since the input doesn't offer specific mutations beyond their association with PD, my response is accurate based on the given data.

    "Description in input context": "mutations in PINK1 or parkin cause autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson disease (PD). Homozygous mutations in parkin are the most common cause of early-onset familial PD. Homozygous mutations in PINK1 are the second most common cause of early-onset recessive PD. Heterozygous mutations in parkin or PINK1 have been implicated as significant risk factors in the development of late-onset PD."
