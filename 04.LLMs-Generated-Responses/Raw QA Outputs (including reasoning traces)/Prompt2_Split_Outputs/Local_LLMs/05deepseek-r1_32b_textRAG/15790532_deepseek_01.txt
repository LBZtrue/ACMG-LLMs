Alright, I need to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraph. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction sections carefully. The abstract mentions mutations in the DJ-1 gene associated with early onset Parkinson's disease. It specifically talks about two point mutations: L166P and M26I. There's also a mention of another variant, R98Q. 

Now, looking at each mutation:

1. **L166P Mutation**: This is described as destabilizing the protein, effectively knocking out the gene. The abstract states that proteasome inhibition partially rescues protein levels but doesn't completely restore them.

2. **M26I Mutation**: This mutation is also unstable but not as severely as L166P. Interestingly, despite its instability, M26I retains the ability to dimerize. Proteasome inhibition helped with protein levels here as well.

3. **R98Q Variant**: Unlike the others, R98Q was generally stable and didn't show issues like the other mutations. The abstract doesn't mention any rescue attempts or specific effects on function for this variant.

Next, I'll consider whether there are any other mutations mentioned in the introduction. The introduction discusses DJ-1's role in Parkinson's but doesn't introduce new mutations beyond what was covered in the abstract. It does mention that mutations may cause mislocalization to mitochondria, but no additional specific mutations are listed here.

So, summarizing:

- **Gene**: DJ-1 is clearly stated.
- **Variants**:
  - L166P: cDNA change isn't specified, so it'll be "N.D." Protein change from Leucine (L) to Proline (P) at position 166. Description includes destabilization and partial rescue by proteasome inhibition.
  - M26I: Similarly, no cDNA details provided. Protein changes from Methionine (M) to Isoleucine (I) at position 26. Notable for retaining dimerization ability despite instability.
  - R98Q: No cDNA info again. Changes from Arginine (R) to Glutamine (Q) at position 98. Described as generally stable.

Since the question only asks about mutations, and R98Q is labeled as a variant, I should check if it's considered a mutation. The abstract describes it as "other variants," which might mean it's less disruptive than the others. Depending on the context, some consider all changes as variants, but traditionally, 'mutations' imply pathogenic changes. However, since L166P and M26I are clearly mutations causing issues, R98Q is included here as a variant for completeness.

No other genes or mutations are mentioned in the provided text, so I don't need to include anything else. Now, structuring this into the required JSON format with placeholders where information isn't available.
