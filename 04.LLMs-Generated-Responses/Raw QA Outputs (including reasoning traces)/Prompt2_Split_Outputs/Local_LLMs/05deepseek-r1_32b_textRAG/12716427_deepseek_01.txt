Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from this given text about Parkinson's disease and a-synuclein. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The abstract mentions that abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies is a hallmark of both sporadic and familial PD. It also notes that mutations in alpha-synuclein have been identified in autosomal dominant PD, but the mechanism isn't fully understood yet. 

Then they talk about their study where they used neuroblastoma cell lines transfected with either normal or mutant alpha-synuclein (A30P or A53T). They looked at transcriptional changes using microarrays and confirmed some genes with qRT-PCR.

So, the key point here is that there are two specific mutations mentioned: A30P and A53T. Both of these are missense mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene. Missense means a single nucleotide change leading to an altered amino acid at positions 30 and 53 respectively.

Looking further, I don't see any other mentions of mutations beyond these two. The rest of the context talks about transcriptional changes, downregulation of certain genes related to dopamine synthesis, and regulation through Nurr1. But no additional mutations are discussed there.

Therefore, based on the given text, the mutations are clearly A30P and A53T in the alpha-synuclein gene. There's no cDNA change mentioned in terms of nucleotide position or reference sequence; it just states the amino acid changes. So for each variant, I'll note the protein changes as per the input.

In summary, the text does contain mutation information, specifically two mutations in alpha-synuclein: A30P and A53T. All other fields like cDNA change or description in context can be filled with "N.D." since they're not provided.
