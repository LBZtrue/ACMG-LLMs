Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a paragraph from medical literature and wants me to extract mutation-related information using the specified JSON format. I need to carefully go through each part of the text to identify any mutations mentioned.

First, I'll read through the abstract to spot any mutation terms. The first sentence mentions "a novel mutation (E46K)" which clearly indicates a mutation. E46K stands for glutamic acid at position 46 being replaced by lysine. So that's one variant right there.

Moving further, the text compares this E46K mutation with another, A53T. That's another mutation where alanine at position 53 is changed to threonine. I'll note that down as a second variant.

Next, the paragraph discusses substituting Glu 46 for an alanine (E46A). This is a different change than E46K but still within the same residue, so it's another mutation point and should be listed separately.

Then, there's a mention of mutating Glu 83 to lysine or alanine, resulting in E83K and E83A mutations. These are two more variants that need extraction.

I'll structure each variant with their respective cDNA changes as "N.D." since the text doesn't provide specific nucleotide information. The protein changes are detailed for each mutation, so I'll include those positions and amino acid substitutions.

Finally, to ensure completeness, any missing fields in the JSON will be marked as "N.D.", adhering strictly to the user's constraints and output format.
