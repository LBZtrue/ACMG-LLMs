Okay, I need to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. Let's start by reading through it carefully.

First, the abstract mentions several DJ-1 mutants found in Parkinson's disease patients. Specifically, L166P is mentioned as a mutant that doesn't prevent H2O2-induced cell death. Then, other mutants are discussed: M26I, R98Q, and D149A. The study looks at their ability to form heterodimers with wild-type DJ-1 and homodimers except for L166P.

Further details include the stability of M26I and L166P mutants being unstable and partially recovered with MG132. Also, cell lines expressing these mutants show that L166P and C106S (which is a mutant affecting protease activity) can't scavenge endogenous reactive oxygen species.

Looking at the background information, DJ-1 was identified as an oncogene product involved in cell transformation with activated ras. It's located on chromosome 1p36.2-p36.3 and has been implicated in various cancers and infertility.

Now, focusing solely on mutations related to DJ-1:

The mutants mentioned are L166P, M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S. Each of these is a protein change without specific cDNA or transcript information provided in the text.

So, for each variant, I'll note the protein change as given. Since no transcript details are present, they'll be marked as N.D. The description will reflect what's stated about each mutant in the context.
