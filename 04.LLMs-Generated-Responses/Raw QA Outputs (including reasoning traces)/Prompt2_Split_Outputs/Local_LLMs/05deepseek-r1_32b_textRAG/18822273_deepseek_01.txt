Okay, I need to analyze the provided abstract from a medical literature source and extract any information related to mutations. The user has specified that only details directly mentioned in the text should be included, and if something isn't mentioned, it should be marked as "N.D.".

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully to identify any mentions of mutations. 

The abstract starts by talking about genetic mutations linked to familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD), specifically mentioning DJ-1. It then states that a novel homozygous missense mutation in the DJ-1 gene has been reported, resulting in an E163K amino acid substitution. This mutation is associated with early-onset PD and other clinical features.

So, the key points here are:
- The gene involved is DJ-1.
- There's a missense mutation causing an E163K change in the protein.

Now, looking at what information I can extract:
- Gene: Clearly mentioned as DJ-1. So, "DJ-1" goes into the Gene field.
- Variants: There is one variant described here.
  - For cDNA Change: The abstract doesn't provide details about the nucleotide change (like which base changed or position), so this will be marked as "N.D." for all subfields under cDNA Change.
  - Protein Change: The mutation leads to an E163K substitution, meaning glutamic acid at position 163 is replaced with lysine. So, the ref amino acid is 'E', alt is 'K', and position is 163.
  - Description in input context: As per the text, it's described as "the novel homozygous missense mutation resulting in the E163K substitution."

I should structure this information into the specified JSON format. Since there are no other mutations mentioned beyond DJ-1 and the E163K change, that's all I'll include.

Before finalizing, I should ensure that all required fields are present and correctly filled. The Gene is provided, variants array has one entry with cDNA Change marked as N.D., Protein Change accurately reflects the mutation, and the Description captures how it was presented in the text.

I think this covers everything the user needs based on the abstract. There's no additional mutation information beyond DJ-1 E163K, so I won't include anything else.
