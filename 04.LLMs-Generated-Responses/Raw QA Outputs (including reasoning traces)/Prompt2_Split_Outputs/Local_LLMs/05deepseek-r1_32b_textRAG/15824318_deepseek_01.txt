Alright, I'm going to tackle this query step by step. The user is an expert in medical literature data mining and needs to extract mutation information from a given text. My role is to assist by providing the relevant details structured in JSON.

First, I'll read through the provided abstract carefully to identify any mentions of mutations. Scanning the content, I notice that the study discusses two specific point mutations: G309D and L347P in the PINK1 gene. Both are associated with recessive parkinsonism, which aligns with the focus on mutations related to Parkinson's disease.

Next, I need to extract each mutation's details. For G309D, it’s mentioned that this mutation is stable and properly localized in cells. However, there isn't a specific cDNA change provided for this variant in the text, so I'll mark that as "N.D." The protein change here is clear: glycine (G) to aspartic acid (D) at position 309.

Moving on to L347P, the abstract states that this mutation destabilizes PINK1 and reduces kinase activity. Again, there's no cDNA change detailed for L347P, so I'll note "N.D." here too. The protein change is from leucine (L) to proline (P) at position 347.

I also need to ensure that the JSON structure is correctly filled. Each variant should be listed under the "variants" array with their respective cDNA and protein changes. Since only protein changes are specified, I'll leave any missing fields as "N.D." to maintain completeness.

Lastly, I'll double-check for any additional mutations or relevant information that might have been overlooked. In this case, there's no mention of other variants, so the JSON will include only G309D and L347P.

Overall, my goal is to provide accurate, concise, and properly formatted data extraction as per the user's requirements.
