Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given literature paragraphs. Let me start by reading through the abstract and the additional context provided.

In the abstract, it mentions "compound heterozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene." Specifically, two mutations are discussed: p.A244G and p.V317I. These seem to be protein-level changes because they're prefixed with 'p.' which usually stands for protein.

Looking at how these are written, p.A244G means that at position 244 in the protein sequence, there's an alanine (A) changed to glycine (G). Similarly, p.V317I indicates a valine (V) at position 317 being replaced by isoleucine (I). 

Now, I need to map this into the JSON format specified. The Gene field would be PINK1 since that's where the mutations are located. For each variant, I should list their cDNA changes and protein changes. However, in the provided text, only the protein changes are explicitly mentioned. There's no mention of the specific cDNA positions or transcripts, so those fields will be marked as "N.D.".

I also need to note that both mutations were found in a sporadic patient with PD-like symptoms, which expands the clinical spectrum of PINK1-related parkinsonism. This context is important for understanding the significance of these mutations but isn't directly part of the mutation details extraction.

So, putting it all together, there are two variants under PINK1: one at position 244 (A to G) and another at position 317 (V to I). Since the cDNA changes aren't specified, those sections will be filled with "N.D." as per instructions.
