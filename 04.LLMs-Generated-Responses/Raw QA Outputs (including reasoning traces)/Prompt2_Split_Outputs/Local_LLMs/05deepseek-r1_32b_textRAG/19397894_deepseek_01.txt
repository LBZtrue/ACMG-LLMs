Alright, I'm looking at this query from the user about extracting mutation information from a medical literature paragraph. They want me to act as an expert in data mining, specifically focusing on mutations.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. The main goal is to determine if the given text contains any mutation-related information and extract it accurately. If there's no relevant info, return "N.D."

Looking at the provided context, it talks about LRRK2 gene mutations in Parkinson's disease. There are specific mutations mentioned: I2020T and G2019S. These are point mutations affecting the kinase activity of the protein.

I should start by identifying the gene involved. Here, it's clearly stated as LRRK2. Next, I need to extract each variant. For each mutation, I have to note the cDNA change and protein change. 

For G2019S:
- The protein change is from glycine (G) at position 2019 to serine (S).
- There's no mention of cDNA changes or the transcript, so those will be "N.D."

For I2020T:
- Similarly, it's a change from isoleucine (I) at position 2020 to threonine (T).
- Again, cDNA details are missing, so they're marked as "N.D."

The description in the input context for both mutations is provided directly. I need to make sure each variant is listed separately within an array.

I should also check if there's any other mutation information beyond what's explicitly mentioned. In this case, only these two are discussed. 

Finally, ensuring that all fields not mentioned are filled with "N.D." as per the user's instructions. The JSON structure must be accurate and comprehensive without omitting any fields.
