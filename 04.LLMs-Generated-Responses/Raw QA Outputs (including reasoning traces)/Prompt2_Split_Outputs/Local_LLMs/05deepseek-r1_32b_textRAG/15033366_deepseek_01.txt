Okay, I need to analyze the given literature paragraph and extract information related to mutations as per the user's instructions.

First, I'll read through the abstract to identify any mentions of mutations. The paragraph discusses a-synuclein and its role in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically mentioning two Parkinson's disease-associated mutants: A30P and A53T. 

Next, I need to extract specific details about these mutations. For each mutation, I should note the gene involved, which is clearly stated as alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein). However, the literature doesn't provide transcript IDs or specific cDNA positions, so those will be marked as N.D.

The protein changes are given directly in the text. A30P indicates an alanine to proline substitution at position 30, and A53T is an alanine to threonine substitution at position 53. 

I'll structure this information into a JSON format, ensuring each mutation is listed under the "variants" array with appropriate details. Since there's no mention of other mutations or additional gene names, I won't include anything else beyond what's provided.

Finally, I'll ensure that all fields not mentioned are filled with N.D. to maintain completeness as per the user's requirements.
