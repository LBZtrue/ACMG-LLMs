Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants to extract information related to mutations from a given paragraph of medical literature. The user is an expert in data mining and needs precise extraction without any speculation.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. It mentions α-synuclein (αS) and its link to Parkinson's disease through three point mutations that cause early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism. So, there are definitely mutation details here.

I need to identify the gene involved, which is clearly stated as αS or α-synuclein. The variants section should include each of these three mutations. However, the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA changes (like nucleotide positions) or protein changes (amino acid substitutions). It just mentions that they are point mutations leading to early onset.

So, for each variant, I'll list them as "Point mutation" in the description but mark cDNA and Protein Change sections as N.D. since those details aren't provided. This ensures the JSON structure remains complete without adding any unsupported information.

I should also ensure that only relevant mutation data is included and nothing else. The output format requires a structured JSON, so I'll make sure to follow that precisely, filling in "N.D." where necessary.

In summary, the key points are:
1. Gene: α-synuclein (αS)
2. Variants: Three point mutations causing Parkinsonism
3. Missing details: cDNA and protein changes

I'll structure this into a JSON response as specified.
