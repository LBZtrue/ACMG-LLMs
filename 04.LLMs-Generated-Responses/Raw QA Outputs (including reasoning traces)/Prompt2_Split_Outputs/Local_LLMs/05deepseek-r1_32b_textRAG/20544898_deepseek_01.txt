Okay, so I need to figure out if the given text contains any information related to mutations and extract the relevant details. Let's start by carefully reading through the paragraph provided.

The abstract talks about alpha-synuclein and its role in Parkinson's disease (PD). It mentions that single point mutations and gene duplication/triplication are causally linked to early-onset familial PD. There are also references to studies with numbers like [5][6][7][8]. So, I can see that mutations are indeed discussed here.

Now, the text doesn't specify particular genes or exact cDNA changes. It just mentions single point mutations and gene duplication/triplication in a general sense. Therefore, there's no specific variant information provided beyond these mentions of mutations causing PD.

Since there’s no detailed information about the variants, such as gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, etc., I should note that all those fields are not mentioned (N.D.). However, it is clear from the context that mutations are a factor in PD, so I can capture that description.

Putting this together into the required JSON format, I'll indicate that while mutation information exists, specific details about variants aren't provided. So the "variants" array will have an entry with all relevant fields as N.D., but include the description from the text.

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",

            },
            "Description in input context": "single point mutations and gene duplication/ triplication that are causally linked to early-onset familial PD"
        }
    ]
}
