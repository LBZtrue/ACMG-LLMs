``` parkin gene mutations and their role in Parkinson's disease, but the provided text does not specify individual mutations with their respective cDNA or protein changes. The text refers to a total of 22 point mutants and mentions that they are missense or nonsense mutations. However, without explicit details on each mutation's cDNA and protein alterations, it is not feasible to extract such information accurately. The existing JSON output reflects the information available in the input text by indicating the total number of mutations and their general type while using "N.D." for unspecified details.
Based on the input provided, the JSON output correctly represents the information available in the text. The passage discusses the parkin gene mutations in the context of Parkinson's disease, indicating that 22 point mutants were analyzed, which are primarily missense or nonsense mutations. However, it does not provide explicit details on individual mutations such as specific cDNA or protein changes. Therefore, the JSON output appropriately uses "N.D." for the unspecified details, reflecting the current state of the input text. parkin gene mutations and their role in Parkinson's disease, but the provided text does not specify individual mutations with their respective cDNA or protein changes.
