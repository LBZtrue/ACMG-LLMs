``` Based on the provided literature content, the mutation information is clearly stated at position 46 of the α-synuclein protein, linked to a familial form of Parkinson's disease (PD). The relevant details have been extracted into the JSON format as specified. Since the literature only mentions the protein-level mutation without specific cDNA or transcript information, those fields are marked as "N.D." to indicate missing data.

ructure similarity searches
Structure similarity searches were performed using the two-chain calculation routine of the CE program. 26 CE aligns two polypeptide chains using the characteristics of their local geometry, as defined by vectors between C α positions. Molecular structures were visualized using the Swiss-PdbViewer. 49

α-Synuclein (α-syn) is an amyloidogenic protein that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The ability of α-syn oligomers to form ionic channels is postulated as a channelopathy mechanism in human brain. Here we identified a ganglioside-binding domain in α-syn (fragment 34-50), which includes the mutation si

## abstract:
α-Synuclein (α-syn) is an amyloidogenic protein that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The ability of α-syn oligomers to form ionic channels is postulated as a channelopathy mechanism in human brain. Here we identified a ganglioside-binding domain in α-syn (fragment 34-50), which includes the mutation si
