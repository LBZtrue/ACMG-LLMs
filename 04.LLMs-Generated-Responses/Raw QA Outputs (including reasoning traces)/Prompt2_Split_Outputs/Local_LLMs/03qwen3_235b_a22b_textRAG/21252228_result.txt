``` Based on the provided input, there is no explicit mention of mutations beyond the reference to the A53T ␣-synuclein mutation, which is already described in the context. Since the task is to extract information related to mutations and the input does not provide additional mutation details, the response is N.D. The JSON structure is completed with "N.D." for all fields to meet the format requirements. ␣-synuclein is mentioned, but the specific mutation (A53T) is not described in the input context provided.
