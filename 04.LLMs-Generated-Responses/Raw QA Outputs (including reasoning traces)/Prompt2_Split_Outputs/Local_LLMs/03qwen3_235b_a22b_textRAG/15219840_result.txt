``` based on the literature provided, this JSON structure presents the mutation information extracted. The input context discusses DJ-1 mutations, specifically indicating the L166P mutation found in Parkinson's disease patients. This mutation is highlighted as having no activity in preventing hydrogen peroxide, indicating its relevance in the study. The gene involved is DJ-1, and the specific variant described is L166P, which represents a change from leucine (L) to proline (P) at position 166 in the protein sequence. The cDNA change is not explicitly mentioned in the input context, so it is marked as N.D.

The input context discusses DJ-1 mutations, specifically indicating the L166P mutation found in Parkinson's disease patients. This mutation is highlighted as having no activity in preventing hydrogen peroxide, indicating its relevance in the study. The gene involved is DJ-1, and the specific variant described is L166P, which represents a change from leucine (L) to proline (P) at position 166 in the protein sequence. The cDNA change is not explicitly mentioned in the input context, so it is marked as N.D.

``` based on the literature provided, this JSON structure presents the mutation information extracted. The input context discusses DJ-1 mutations, specifically indicating the L166P mutation found in Parkinson's disease patients. This mutation is highlighted as having no activity in preventing hydrogen peroxide, indicating its relevance in the study. The gene involved is DJ-1, and the specific variant described is L166P, which represents a change from leucine (L) to proline (P) at position 166 in the protein sequence. The cDNA change is not explicitly mentioned in the input context, so it is marked as N.D.
