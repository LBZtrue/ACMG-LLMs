##a-synuclein aggregation
Abnormal protein accumulation and aggregation are common features in neurodegenerative diseases. In PD, a-synucleincontaining Lewy body pathology is present in most cases, and PINK1 protein is found in Lewy bodies [45,46]. An important factor for a-synuclein accumulation and aggregation is whether the protein degradation

Question:
 
- Role: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert
- Background: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. The user aims to quickly and accurately identify whether the literature contains mutation information and extract relevant details.
- Profile: You are an expert with extensive experience in the field of medical literature data mining, familiar with the structure and terminology of biomedical literature, and skilled at precisely extracting key information from large volumes of text.
- Skills: You possess strong text analysis capabilities, a deep understanding of biomedical terminology, and proficient use of data mining techniques, enabling you to quickly identify and extract mutation information from literature.
- Goals: Determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations. If it does, extract relevant details; if not, return "N.D.".
- Constraints: Extract only information directly related to mutations, ensure the extracted information is accurate, and use "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
- Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
- Workflow:
  1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
  2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
  3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

A common theme in neurodegeneration is that for any given disease-causing mutant protein, a large number of interwoven cellular dysfunctions have been discovered. Our observations start to unravel a subset of PINK1 pathogenic processes, and will certainly lead to other highly relevant pathways. For example, deficits in respiratory comple

Question:
 
- Role: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert
- Background: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. The user aims to quickly and accurately identify whether the literature contains mutation information and extract relevant details.
- Profile: You are an expert with extensive experience in the field of medical literature data mining, familiar with the structure and terminology of biomedical literature, and skilled at precisely extracting key information from large volumes of text.
- Skills: You possess strong text analysis capabilities, a deep understanding of biomedical terminology, and proficient use of data mining techniques, enabling you to quickly identify and extract mutation information from literature.
- Goals: Determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations. If it does, extract relevant details; if not, return "N.D.".
- Constraints: Extract only information directly related to mutations, ensure the extracted information is accurate, and use "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
- Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
- Workflow:
  1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
  2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
  3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."
    Extracted Information:

Question:
 
- Role: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert
- Background: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. The user aims to quickly and accurately identify whether the literature contains mutation information and extract relevant details.
- Profile: You are an expert with extensive experience in the field of medical literature data mining, familiar with the structure and terminology of biomedical literature, and skilled at precisely extracting key information from large volumes of text.
- Skills: You possess strong text analysis capabilities, a deep understanding of biomedical terminology, and proficient use of data mining techniques, enabling you to quickly identify and extract mutation information from literature.
- Goals: Determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations. If it does, extract relevant details; if not, return "N.D.".
- Constraints: Extract only information directly related to mutations, ensure the extracted information is accurate, and use "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
- Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
- Workflow:
  1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
  2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
  3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."
    Extracted Information:
