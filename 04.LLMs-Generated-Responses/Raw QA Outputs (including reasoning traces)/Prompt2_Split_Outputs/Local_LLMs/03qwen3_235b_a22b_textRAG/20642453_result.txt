The raw mass spectrometric data files obtained for each experiment were collated into a single quantified dataset using MaxQuant (version 1.0.13.13; http://www.maxquant.org) and the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, version 2.2.2) software. Enzyme specificity was set to that of trypsin. Other parameters used within the software: variable modifications, methionine oxidation; database, target-decoy human MaxQuant (ipi.HUMAN.v3.52.decoy) (containing 148 380 database entries); labels, R6K4 (for GFP compared with wild-type LRRK2) or R10K8 [for GFP compared with LRRK2(G2019S)]; MS/MS toleran
