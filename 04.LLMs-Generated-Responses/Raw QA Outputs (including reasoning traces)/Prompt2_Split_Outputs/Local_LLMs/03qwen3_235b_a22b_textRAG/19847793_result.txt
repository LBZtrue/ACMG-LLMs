``` The text provided mentions a mutation in the PINK1 gene at exon 8, resulting in a protein change from aspartic acid to asparagine at position 525 (p.D525N). Additionally, it refers to a cDNA change at positions 203-204 (c.203-204GC→ something unspecified). However, the alt nucleotide for the cDNA change and other details are not explicitly stated in the text. Hence, only the mutation with available details is included in the JSON output.

``` The text provided mentions a mutation in the PINK1 gene at exon 8, resulting in a protein change from aspartic acid to asparagine at position 525 (p.D525N). Additionally, it refers to a cDNA change at positions 203-204 (c.203-204GC→ something unspecified). However, the alt nucleotide for the cDNA change and other details are not explicitly stated in the text. Hence, only the mutation with available details is included in the JSON output.
