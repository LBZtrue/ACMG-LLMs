``` erence, and the protein change position. However, the input context does not provide the cDNA change details, such as the transcript, reference nucleotide, alternate nucleotide, and position. Therefore, these fields are filled with "N.D." as specified in the constraints.

The mutations mentioned in the input context are:
1. G2019S mutant
2. I2020T mutant
3. R1441C mutant

For each mutation, the gene is "LRRK2" as mentioned in the introduction. The protein change reference, alternate, and position are extracted from the mutation description. Since the cDNA change information is not provided in the input context, those fields are marked with "N.D.".

The output format follows the specified JSON structure, ensuring that all required fields are included and any missing information is supplemented with "N.D.".
Okay, I need to process the given medical literature text to extract mutation information. Let me start by reading through the context provided.

The introduction mentions LRRK2 as the gene responsible for PARK8, an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease. The user's question focuses on identifying mutations in the text. Looking at the context, there's a part that lists "G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant." These are protein changes, each indicating a substitution at a specific position. 

First, I need to determine the gene. The text clearly states LRRK2 is responsible for PARK8, so the gene here is LRRK2. 

Next, the mutations listed are G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. These are protein-level mutations, using the one-letter amino acid codes. For each variant, the protein change's reference (ref), alternate (alt), and position need to be captured. 

For example, G2019S means Glycine (G) at position 2019 is substituted with Serine (S). Similarly, I2020T is Isoleucine (I) to Threonine (T) at position 2020, and R1441C is Arginine (R) to Cysteine (C) at position 1441. 

The cDNA change details (like transcript, reference nucleotide, alternate nucleotide, and position) aren't mentioned in the text provided. The user's constraints specify using "N.D." for any unmentioned information. Therefore, all cDNA Change fields will be "N.D." since the text doesn't include cDNA level changes. 

Each mutation should be a separate object in the "variants" array. The "Description in input context" for each would be the exact terms provided in the text, such as "G2019S mutant."

I need to structure this into the specified JSON format. Ensure that the gene is correctly listed as LRRK2 and each variant includes the protein change details. All cDNA Change fields should have "N.D." for their keys. No additional explanations or repeated structures, just the JSON once.

            "Description in input context": "R1441C mutant"
        }
    ]
}
``` erence, alternate, and position for each protein change. Since the input context only provides protein-level mutation descriptions (e.g., G2019S, I2020T, R1441C) without corresponding cDNA-level details, all cDNA Change fields are marked as "N.D." as per the constraints. The gene is correctly identified as LRRK2 based on the introduction section of the text. Each variant is structured as an individual object within the variants array, with the Description in input context field preserving the exact mutation terminology from the original text.
Okay, I need to analyze the given medical literature text to extract any mutation information. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The introduction mentions that LRRK2 is the gene responsible for autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (PARK8). Then, in the experimental section, it refers to "G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant" in the context of phosphorylation assays. These are protein-level mutations, indicated by the format (e.g., G2019S means glycine at position 2019 is replaced by serine).

First, the gene is clearly LRRK2. The variants listed are G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. Each of these has a reference amino acid (G, I, R), alternate (S, T, C), and positions 2019, 2020, 1441. The text does not mention cDNA changes, such as nucleotide substitutions, so those fields should be N.D. The description in the context is exactly as given (e.g., "G2019S mutant").

I need to structure this into the JSON format provided. Each variant should be an object in the variants array. The gene is LRRK2. Since there's no cDNA information, all cDNA Change fields are N.D. Protein changes are filled with the ref, alt, and positions. The description should capture the exact phrase from the text.

I should make sure that all required fields are present and that N.D. is used where necessary. Let me check the example given. In the example, when cDNA change was mentioned, it was filled; otherwise, N.D. So this matches. The output should have the gene and three variants, each with the correct protein changes and descriptions.

            },
            "Description in input context": "R1441C mutant"
        }
    ]
}
``` erence, alternate, and position. The input context does not provide any cDNA change information, so all cDNA Change fields are set to "N.D." as required by the constraints. The "Description in input context" field captures the exact mutation terminology used in the original text for each variant.
Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph from medical literature and wants me to extract mutation information. My task is to check if there are any mutations mentioned and then structure the data into a specific JSON format. 

First, I'll read through the context again. The introduction mentions LRRK2 as the gene responsible for PARK8, which is an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease. Then, in the experimental part, they talk about using wild-type (WT) and various mutants: G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. These are protein changes because they're using the format where a letter (amino acid) is followed by a number (position) and another letter (substituted amino acid). 

So, the gene here is LRRK2. The mutations listed are G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. Each of these corresponds to a protein change. The user's example shows that when only protein changes are given, the cDNA Change fields should be N.D. because there's no nucleotide-level information provided.

Now, I need to structure this into the JSON format. The Gene is LRRK2. Each variant should have the protein change details: ref (original amino acid), alt (new amino acid), position. The cDNA Change fields are all N.D. since the text doesn't mention any cDNA mutations. The Description in input context should be the exact terms from the text, like "G2019S mutant".

I should make sure there are three entries in the variants array, each corresponding to one of the mutants listed. Let me double-check each mutation:

- G2019S: ref is G, alt is S, position 2019
- I2020T: ref I, alt T, position 2020
- R1441C: ref R, alt C, position 1441

Yes, that's correct. All cDNA Change fields are N.D. as per the constraints. The JSON structure matches the required format. I think that's all. No other mutations mentioned, so this should be the final answer.

        }
    ]
}
``` erence, alternate, and position. Since no cDNA-level mutation details are provided in the input text, all cDNA Change fields are marked as "N.D." as required by the constraints. Each mutation is explicitly listed in the text as a protein-level variant (e.g., "G2019S mutant"), and these descriptions are preserved in the "Description in input context" field.
Okay, I need to check if the provided text contains any mutation information and extract it according to the specified JSON format. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The introduction mentions that LRRK2 is the gene responsible for autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (PARK8). Then, in the experimental section, there's a list of mutants used: "wild-type (WT), G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant". These are clearly protein-level mutations, indicated by the amino acid substitution notation (e.g., G2019S means Glycine at position 2019 is replaced by Serine).

The task is to extract the gene, each variant's cDNA and protein changes, and their descriptions. However, the text only provides protein-level mutations (G2019S, I2020T, R1441C) without any corresponding cDNA-level details. So, the cDNA Change fields should be "N.D." since they aren't mentioned. 

For each variant, the gene is LRRK2. The protein changes are straightforward: reference amino acid, alternate amino acid, and position. The descriptions are the exact terms from the text (e.g., "G2019S mutant"). 

I need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. There are three mutants, so the variants array should have three entries. Each entry has cDNA Change as N.D. and the protein change details. The description captures the exact phrase from the context.

I should make sure that all required fields are included and that N.D. is used where information isn't present. The example provided uses N.D. for missing cDNA data, which matches this scenario. No other mutations are mentioned, so the JSON should only include these three.

Okay, I need to determine if the given medical literature text contains mutation information and extract it accordingly. Let me start by reading through the context provided.

The introduction mentions that LRRK2 is the gene responsible for autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (PARK8). In the experimental section, there's a part where they used wild-type (WT), G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant in their assays. These names clearly indicate specific mutations in the LRRK2 gene.

So, the gene here is LRRK2. The mutations listed are G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. These are protein-level mutations, as indicated by the format (e.g., G2019S means Glycine at position 2019 is replaced by Serine). The text doesn't mention any cDNA changes, like nucleotide substitutions, so those fields should be N.D.

Each mutation should be an entry in the variants array. For each, the protein change will include the reference amino acid (G, I, R), the alternate (S, T, C), and the position (2019, 2020, 1441). The description in the input context is exactly how they're mentioned, like "G2019S mutant".

I need to structure this into the JSON format specified. The gene is LRRK2, and each variant has cDNA Change as N.D. and the protein changes as detailed. The description should capture the exact term from the text. Let me check the example again to make sure. The example uses N.D. for cDNA when not present, which matches here. All three mutations should be listed as separate objects in the variants array. That should cover everything without missing any fields.

Okay, let me start by reading through the provided context to identify any mutations mentioned. The introduction states that LRRK2 is the gene responsible for PARK8, an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease. Then, in the experimental section, there's a mention of using wild-type (WT), G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant in the presence of cold c-ATP.

So, the mutations listed here are G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. These are all protein-level mutations, as indicated by the notation (e.g., G2019S means glycine at position 2019 is replaced with serine). The context doesn't mention any cDNA-level changes, so those fields should be N.D. as per the constraints.

The gene is clearly LRRK2. Each variant should be an object in the variants array with the protein change details. The description in the input context should be the exact terms from the text, like "G2019S mutant" for each mutation.

I need to make sure that all required JSON fields are present and that any missing information is marked with N.D. There are three mutations here, so the variants array should have three entries. Each entry should have the correct protein change reference, alternate, and position. The cDNA Change fields will all be N.D. since there's no nucleotide-level information provided.

Let me double-check the positions and amino acids. G2019S: ref G, alt S, position 2019. I2020T: ref I, alt T, position 2020. R1441C: ref R, alt C, position 1441. That looks correct. The descriptions are exactly as written in the context.

I think that's all. The JSON should be structured correctly now with all the required information extracted accurately.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to extract mutation information from a medical literature paragraph. The role here is to determine if there are any mutations mentioned and then structure that information into a specific JSON format.

First, I'll read through the provided context. The introduction mentions LRRK2 as the gene responsible for PARK8, which is an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease. Then, in the experimental section, they list three mutants: G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. These are all protein-level mutations since they're described using the one-letter amino acid codes followed by their positions.

The next step is to map this information into the required JSON structure. The gene is clearly LRRK2. Each mutation needs to be an object in the variants array. For each mutation, the protein change includes the reference amino acid (ref), alternate amino acid (alt), and position. 

However, the context doesn't mention any cDNA changes, like nucleotide substitutions. According to the constraints, any missing information should be marked as N.D. So, all the cDNA Change fields will have N.D. across the board.

I need to ensure that each variant's description in the input context is exactly as provided in the text. For example, "G2019S mutant" should be captured as-is. 

Now, checking the example given in the problem statement. The example uses N.D. for cDNA fields when there's no information, which matches our case. The structure should have the gene and variants array with each mutation's details. 

Three mutations are listed, so the variants array will have three entries. Each entry will have the protein change details filled out and cDNA Change fields as N.D. 

I should also verify that the JSON structure matches exactly, with proper commas and brackets. No extra fields or missing keys. The user emphasized strict adherence to the template, so even if something seems optional, it must be included with N.D. if not present.

Finally, making sure that there are no typos in the amino acid codes and positions. For instance, G2019S translates to ref G, alt S, position 2019. Similarly, I2020T and R1441C follow the same pattern. 

Once all this is confirmed, the JSON output should be correctly formatted and contain all the necessary mutation information extracted from the text.

Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text to identify any mutations. The introduction mentions LRRK2 as the gene responsible for PARK8, an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease.

The task is to extract the gene and each mutation's details into the specified JSON format. The gene is clearly LRRK2. Each mutation has a protein change with reference (original), alternate (new), and position. The cDNA change details aren't provided in the text, so those fields should be "N.D." as per the constraints.

I need to structure each mutation as an object in the variants array. There are three mutations: G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. Each will have their respective protein change information. The description in the input context should be the exact terms used, like "G2019S mutant."

I should make sure all JSON fields are present. For cDNA Change, since there's no nucleotide-level info, all entries are N.D. The protein changes are filled with the correct amino acids and positions. The descriptions are taken directly from the text. No other mutations are mentioned, so this should cover everything.

Okay, let's start by looking at the provided text to see if there are any mutations mentioned.

Then, in the experimental section, they mention using "wild-type (WT), G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant." These are specific mutations in the LRRK2 gene.

So, the gene here is LRRK2. The mutations listed are G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. Each of these corresponds to a change in the protein sequence: G (glycine) at position 2019 becomes S (serine), I (isoleucine) at 2020 becomes T (threonine), and R (arginine) at 1441 becomes C (cysteine). 

The text doesn't provide any cDNA change information, like the specific nucleotide substitutions. Therefore, according to the constraints, all cDNA Change fields should be "N.D." since they aren't mentioned. 

Each mutation should be an object in the variants array. The "Description in input context" should exactly match the terms from the text, like "G2019S mutant". 

I need to structure this into the JSON format specified. The gene is LRRK2. Each variant has the protein change details filled out, and cDNA Change fields as N.D. The descriptions are taken directly from the text. There are three mutations, so three entries in the variants array.

G2019S means glycine (G) at position 2019 is replaced by serine (S). Similarly, I2020T is isoleucine (I) at 2020 changing to threonine (T), and R1441C is arginine (R) at position 1441 replaced by cysteine (C).

The context doesn't mention any cDNA changes, like nucleotide substitutions, so the cDNA Change fields should all be "N.D." as per the constraints. The protein changes are clearly provided here, so each variant should have the reference amino acid, alternate, and position filled in.

Now, structuring this into the JSON format specified. The gene is LRRK2. Each variant will be an object in the variants array. Each object should have the cDNA Change fields as N.D., the protein change details, and the description as given in the input context. 

I need to make sure that all required fields are present and that missing information is marked with N.D. There are three mutations here, so the variants array should have three entries. Let me double-check each mutation's details to ensure accuracy.

``` erence, alternate, and position. Since the input context does not provide cDNA-level mutation details, all cDNA Change fields are marked as "N.D." as required by the constraints. The "Description in input context" field preserves the exact mutation terminology used in the original text for each variant.
Okay, I need to check if the provided text contains any mutation information and then extract it into the specified JSON format. Let's start by reading through the context.

The introduction mentions that LRRK2 is the gene responsible for PARK8, an autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease. In the experimental section, they list "G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant." These are protein-level mutations, indicated by the format (e.g., G2019S means glycine at position 2019 is replaced by serine).

So, the gene is LRRK2. The mutations are G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. Each of these has a reference amino acid, alternate, and position. The text doesn't mention cDNA changes, so those fields should be "N.D." as per the constraints.

Now, structuring the JSON: the gene is LRRK2, and each variant should have the protein change details. Each mutation's description in the input context is exactly as listed (e.g., "G2019S mutant"). There are three mutations, so three entries in the variants array. All cDNA Change fields are N.D. since they aren't provided in the text.

I need to make sure that all required fields are present and that missing data is filled with N.D. The example provided in the problem statement uses N.D. for cDNA changes when not mentioned, which matches this scenario. Each protein change is correctly parsed from the mutation names. That should cover everything.

Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text to identify any mutations mentioned. The introduction states that LRRK2 is the gene responsible for PARK8, an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease. In the experimental section, there's a part that lists "G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant." These are specific mutations in the LRRK2 gene.

Each mutation is described using the protein change notation (e.g., G2019S indicates glycine at position 2019 is replaced by serine). The text doesn't mention any cDNA changes, like nucleotide substitutions, so those fields should be marked as "N.D." according to the constraints. 

The gene is clearly LRRK2. There are three variants listed: G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. For each variant, the protein change includes the reference amino acid (ref), alternate (alt), and position. 

I need to structure this into the JSON format specified. Each variant will be an object in the variants array. All cDNA Change fields should be "N.D." since there's no information provided about them in the text. The description in the input context should be exactly as written, like "G2019S mutant."

I should make sure that all required fields are present and that any missing information is filled with "N.D." There are three mutations, so the variants array will have three entries. Each entry correctly maps the protein change details as per the original text.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a medical literature paragraph. The first step is to check if the text contains any mentions of mutations. 

Looking at the context provided, the introduction mentions that LRRK2 is the gene responsible for PARK8, which is an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease. Then, in the experimental section, they list "G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant." These are clearly protein-level mutations since they're written in the format of amino acid substitutions at specific positions.

So the gene here is LRRK2. The mutations are G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. Each of these corresponds to a change in the protein sequence. The notation used (e.g., G2019S) indicates the original amino acid (G), the new one (S), and the position (2019). 

The user's constraints state that only directly mentioned mutation information should be extracted, and missing details should be filled with "N.D." The text doesn't mention any cDNA changes, like nucleotide substitutions, so all cDNA Change fields should be "N.D."

Now, structuring the JSON as per the example. The gene is LRRK2. Each mutation will be an object in the variants array. Each object should have the cDNA Change fields as "N.D." and the protein change details filled with the ref (original amino acid), alt (new amino acid), and position. The description in the input context should be exactly as written in the text, such as "G2019S mutant."

I need to make sure there are three entries in the variants array, one for each mutation. All cDNA Change fields are "N.D." since they aren't provided. The protein changes are correctly parsed from the mutation names. The descriptions are taken directly from the text. That should cover all the requirements.

Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text to check for any mutations mentioned. The introduction states that LRRK2 is the gene responsible for PARK8, which is an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease. Then, in the experimental section, there's a part where they mention using "G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant" in their assays.

These terms—G2019S, I2020T, R1441C—are all protein-level mutations. Each consists of the original amino acid (G, I, R), the position (2019, 2020, 1441), and the substituted amino acid (S, T, C). The text doesn't provide any cDNA-level changes (like nucleotide substitutions), so according to the constraints, those fields should be marked as "N.D."

The gene is clearly LRRK2, as stated in the introduction. Each mutation should be an entry in the variants array. For each, the protein change will have ref (original), alt (substituted), and position. The cDNA Change fields are all N.D. since they aren't mentioned. The description in the input context should exactly match the terms from the text, such as "G2019S mutant."

I need to structure this into the JSON format specified. There are three mutations listed, so the variants array will have three objects. Each object should have the correct protein change details, cDNA Change as N.D., and the description from the text. Let me double-check that all fields are present and that N.D. is used where appropriate.

``` erence, alternate, and position. Since the input context does not provide cDNA-level mutation details, all cDNA Change fields are marked as "N.D." as required by the constraints. The "Description in input context" field preserves the exact mutation terminology used in the original text for each variant.
Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text to check for any mutations mentioned. The introduction states that LRRK2 is the gene responsible for PARK8, an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease. Then, in the experimental section, they list "G2019S mutant, I2020T mutant, or R1441C mutant." These are clearly protein-level mutations, indicated by the amino acid substitutions at specific positions (2019, 2020, 1441).

The gene here is LRRK2. The mutations mentioned are G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. Each of these corresponds to a change in the protein sequence: glycine (G) to serine (S) at position 2019, isoleucine (I) to threonine (T) at 2020, and arginine (R) to cysteine (C) at 1441.

The text doesn't mention any cDNA changes, like nucleotide substitutions, so according to the constraints, all cDNA Change fields should be "N.D." since that information isn't provided. 

I need to structure this into the JSON format specified. Each mutation should be an object in the variants array, with the protein change details filled in and cDNA Change fields as "N.D." The description in the input context should be exactly as written, like "G2019S mutant."

Let me make sure there are three entries in the variants array, each with the correct protein change details. All cDNA Change fields are "N.D." as required. The gene is correctly identified as LRRK2. This should meet all the user's requirements.
