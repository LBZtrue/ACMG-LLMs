```Based on the given context, the literature mentions the T53A mutation and describes its potential role as an evolutionary adaptation in humans to minimize the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). The mutation involves a change from threonine (Thr) to alanine (Ala) at position 53 in the protein sequence. However, the specific gene involved is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so it is denoted as "N.D." in the JSON output. All other relevant mutation details are extracted as per the specified format.
