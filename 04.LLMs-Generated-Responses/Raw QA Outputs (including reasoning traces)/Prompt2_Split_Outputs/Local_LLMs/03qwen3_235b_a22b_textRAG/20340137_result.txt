Multiple entries of the same JSON structure were generated, which is incorrect. Please ensure that the JSON output is generated exactly once.

Answer:
```json
{
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "157"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.157G>A (formerly reported as G209A)"
        }
    ]
}
```
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the given text and format it into a JSON structure. The task is to check if the input contains any mutation-related details and then pull out specific elements like the gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and a description.

First, I need to read through the provided context. The abstract mentions genetic alterations in the SNCA gene related to Parkinson's Disease. The figures and detection section specifically talk about the c.157G4A mutation, formerly known as G209A. This seems to be the key mutation here.

Looking at the JSON example provided, the structure requires "Gene" and "variants". Each variant should have "cDNA Change", "Protein Change", and "Description in input context". The cDNA change includes transcript, ref, alt, and position. Protein change has ref, alt, and position. If any of these aren't mentioned, use N.D.

The gene here is clearly SNCA (alpha-synuclein). The mutation mentioned is c.157G>A (formerly G209A). The text doesn't mention any protein change like an amino acid substitution, so those fields should be N.D. The cDNA position is 157, with G as the reference and A as the alternate. The transcript isn't specified, so that's N.D. The description is the exact notation from the text.

I need to make sure that each field is filled correctly. There's only one variant here. The user had multiple identical JSON outputs before, but the correct answer should have it once. So the final JSON should have the gene as SNCA, and the variants array with one entry containing the cDNA details and description, with protein change fields as N.D.

```json
{
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "157"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.157G>A (formerly reported as G209A)"
        }
    ]
