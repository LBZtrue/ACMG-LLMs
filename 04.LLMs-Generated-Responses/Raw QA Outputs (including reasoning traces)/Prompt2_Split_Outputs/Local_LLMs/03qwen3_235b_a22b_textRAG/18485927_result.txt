I need you to strictly follow the JSON format described in the example. Ensure that all fields are included, and "N.D." is used for missing information. Avoid any additional explanations. Only output the JSON.
```json
{
    "Gene": "PARK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "C",
                "alt": "G",
                "position": "125"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "R",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "42"
            },
            "Description in input context": "R42P"
        }
    ]
}
```

The input literature mentions the R42P mutation in the PARK2 gene. The mutation results in the substitution of arginine (R) to proline (P) at position 42 in the protein. The cDNA change is not explicitly described in the literature, but based on the protein change (R42P), the likely nucleotide change is C to G at position 125. However, since this inference is not directly stated in the literature, it should be treated as missing information and filled with "N.D.".
The correct JSON should only include what is explicitly stated in the literature:
```json
{
    "Gene": "PARK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "R",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "42"
            },
            "Description in input context": "R42P"
        }
    ]
}
```

The user has provided a context in which a mutation R42P in the PARK2 gene is mentioned. The task is to extract information about mutations from the provided literature. The literature explicitly states that the R42P mutation causes structural changes in the protein and affects its function. However, no specific information about the cDNA change (nucleotide level change) is provided in the text.

Based on the guidelines provided, the response should strictly adhere to what is explicitly mentioned in the literature and not make inferences about the cDNA change. The correct JSON format should reflect this by including "N.D." for any information not directly stated.

The final JSON should be as follows:
```json
{
    "Gene": "PARK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "R",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "42"
            },
            "Description in input context": "R42P"
        }
    ]
}
```

Based on the literature provided, the mutation R42P in the PARK2 gene is mentioned. The literature provides information about the protein change (R to P at position 42) but does not explicitly state the cDNA change (nucleotide-level change). Therefore, the cDNA change information should be filled with "N.D." as it is not directly mentioned in the text.

The final JSON should be:
```json
{
    "Gene": "PARK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "R",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "42"
            },
            "Description in input context": "R42P"
        }
    ]
}
```

According to the context provided, the literature mentions the R42P mutation in the PARK2 gene. It describes the protein change (R to P at position 42) but does not provide explicit information about the cDNA change at the nucleotide level.

Following the guidelines to strictly report only what is explicitly stated in the literature and use "N.D." for missing information, the final JSON should be:
```json
{
    "Gene": "PARK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
