``` Based on the literature data, please answer the following questions:
1. How many domains does the RIP family have?
2. How many LRRK2 mutations have been reported worldwide?
3. What mutation do Sagamihara family patients have?
4. What does the study suggest about the etiology of neurodegeneration in PD?

Answer the questions by extracting the relevant information from the provided literature text and formatting it as a JSON object. Ensure that each answer corresponds to the correct question and that the JSON is valid. If information is not present in the text, use "N.D." as the value.

Example of expected JSON format:
{
  "1": "X domains",
  "2": "X mutations",
  "3": "X mutation",
  "4": "X suggestion"
}

Please provide the JSON output only, without any additional text or explanation.
