Based on the provided literature abstract, the text discusses mutations in the LRRK2 gene and their association with Parkinson's disease. The mutations specifically mentioned are G2019S and I2020T. Both mutations are noted to affect LRRK2 kinase activity, with G2019S showing higher activity and I2020T showing lower kinase activity in assays. The abstract does not provide cDNA change positions for these mutations but does describe the protein changes and their respective positions.

Let's break down the extracted information:
1. Gene: LRRK2 is identified as the gene with mutations that are a significant cause of Parkinson's disease.
2. Variants:
   - G2019S Mutation:
     - Protein Change: The reference amino acid is glycine (G), and the alternative amino acid is serine (S) at position 2019.
     - The text does not specify the cDNA change, so it is marked as "N.D."
     - Description in input context: G2019S is mentioned as having higher kinase activity.
   - I2020T Mutation:
     - Protein Change: The reference amino acid is isoleucine (I), and the alternative amino acid is threonine (T) at position 2020.
     - The text does not specify the cDNA change, so it is marked as "N.D."
     - Description in input context: I2020T is mentioned as having lower kinase activity in assays measuring substrate phosphorylation.

The abstract does not provide detailed cDNA changes, including the transcript or specific nucleotide position, so these fields are filled with "N.D." as per the constraints. The protein changes and their positions are clearly stated in the abstract, allowing for accurate extraction. The descriptions of the mutations' effects on kinase activity are also directly mentioned, aligning with the input context.

In summary, the JSON structure provided accurately reflects the mutation information present in the abstract, with missing data appropriately marked as "N.D." according to the guidelines.

Now, I will generate the required JSON output.
