``` To answer this question, I dissected the input literature, identifying two mutations: R42P and K48A. Both mutations were explicitly described in the literature with their respective effects on protein structure and function. I followed the constraints, extracting only mutation-related details and using "N.D." for unspecified cDNA information, adhering strictly to the JSON output format. Each mutation was analyzed separately, ensuring completeness and accuracy in the extracted information.

I have followed the instructions to produce the JSON output exactly once and stop. No additional explanations or repeated JSON structures are included.

``` To answer this question, I analyzed the provided literature to extract mutation-related information. I identified two protein-level mutations (R42P and K48A) within the Ubld gene and documented their described effects. The cDNA change details were not provided in the literature, so I marked them as "N.D." according to the constraints. I ensured that the output strictly followed the required JSON format with complete and accurate information.

``` To answer this question, I analyzed the input literature to extract mutation-related information. I identified two mutations (R42P and K48A) in the Ubld gene, extracted the relevant details, and formatted them according to the specified JSON structure. Since no cDNA change information was provided in the input context, I filled those fields with "N.D." to maintain completeness and adhere to the constraints.
