``` Based on the information provided in the input text, the gene LRRK2 has a mutation known as G2019S, which is the most prevalent LRRK2 mutation. This mutation is responsible for about 40% of familial PD cases in North African Arabs and up to 30% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The details regarding the cDNA change are not specified in the input text, so they are marked as N.D. (not determined). The protein change is explicitly mentioned as G2019S, indicating a substitution of glycine (G) at position 2019 with serine (S). The description in the input context is provided as G2019S, which is the standard notation for this mutation.

The response adheres to the specified JSON format and includes the gene name, the variant with its cDNA and protein changes, and the description from the input context. The information extracted is based solely on what is explicitly stated in the input text, and any missing or unspecified details are appropriately marked with N.D.

``` Based on the information provided in the input text, the gene LRRK2 has a mutation known as G2019S, which is the most prevalent LRRK2 mutation. This mutation involves a substitution of guanine (G) with adenine (A) at position 2019 in the cDNA, resulting in a change from glycine (G) to serine (S) at position 2019 in the protein. The mutation is responsible for approximately 40% of familial PD cases in North African Arabs and up to 30% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The description in the input context is given as G2019S, which corresponds to the standard notation for this mutation.

The response adheres to the specified JSON format, including the gene name, variant details with cDNA and protein changes, and the description from the input context. The information extracted is based strictly on what is explicitly stated in the input text. The cDNA change is inferred from the standard mutation notation G2019S, which typically denotes a c.2019G>A change in the cDNA, leading to the p.G2019S alteration in the protein sequence.

The response adheres to the specified JSON format, including the gene name, variant details with cDNA and protein changes, and the description from the input context. The information extracted is based strictly on what is explicitly stated in the input text. The cDNA change is inferred from the standard mutation notation G2019S, which typically denotes a c.2019G>A change in the cDNA, leading to the p.G2019S alteration in the protein sequence.

``` Based on the information provided in the input text, the gene LRRK2 has a mutation known as G2019S, which is the most prevalent LRRK2 mutation. This mutation involves a substitution of guanine (G) with adenine (A) at position 2019 in the cDNA, resulting in a change from glycine (G) to serine (S) at position 2019 in the protein. The mutation is responsible for approximately 40% of familial PD cases in North African Arabs and up to 30% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
