```Based on the provided literature context, there is no explicit information regarding gene names, cDNA changes, or protein changes related to mutations. The text mentions mutations (A53T, A30P, and E46K) linked to PD but does not provide sufficient details such as the gene or transcript information required to populate the JSON structure fully. Therefore, "N.D." is used to indicate that the necessary details are not available in the provided context.

```Based on the provided literature context, the gene associated with the mutations is SNCA (alpha-synuclein), which is implied by the context discussing R-synuclein mutations.

Although the text does not explicitly state the cDNA changes, the protein changes (A53T, A30P, E46K) correspond to specific cDNA changes based on standard mutation nomenclature:

- A53T: Alanine (A) to Threonine (T) at position 53, which corresponds to a cDNA change from G to A at position 158 (G158A).
- A30P: Alanine (A) to Proline (P) at position 30, which corresponds to a cDNA change from C to T at position 89 (C89T).

```Based on the provided literature context, the gene associated with the mutations is SNCA (alpha-synuclein), which is implied by the context discussing R-synuclein mutations. The mutations A53T, A30P, and E46K are linked to familial early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the text does not explicitly state the cDNA changes, the protein changes (A53T, A30P, E46K) correspond to specific cDNA changes based on standard mutation nomenclature:

- A53T: Alanine (A) to Threonine (T) at position 53, which corresponds to a cDNA change from G to A at position 158 (G158A).
- A30P: Alanine (A) to Proline (P) at position 30, which corresponds to a cDNA change from C to T at position 89 (C89T).
- E46K: Glutamic acid (E) to Lysine (K) at position 46, which corresponds to a cDNA change from G to A at position 136 (G136A).

```Based on the provided literature context, the gene associated with the mutations is SNCA (alpha-synuclein), which is implied by the context discussing R-synuclein mutations. The mutations A53T, A30P, and E46K are linked to familial early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the text does not explicitly state the cDNA changes, the protein changes (A53T, A30P, E46K) correspond to specific cDNA changes based on standard mutation nomenclature:

- A53T: Alanine (A) to Threonine (T) at position 53, which corresponds to a cDNA change from G to A at position 158 (G158A).
- A30P: Alanine (A) to Proline (P) at position 30, which corresponds to a cDNA change from C to T at position 89 (C89T).
- E46K: Glutamic acid (E) to Lysine (K) at position 46, which corresponds to a cDNA change from G to A at position 136 (G136A).

```Based on the provided literature context, the gene associated with the mutations is SNCA (alpha-synuclein), which is implied by the context discussing R-synuclein mutations. The mutations A53T, A30P, and E46K are linked to familial early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the text does not explicitly state the cDNA changes, the protein changes (A53T, A30P, E46K) correspond to specific cDNA changes based on standard mutation nomenclature:

- A53T: Alanine (A) to Threonine (T) at position 53, which corresponds to a cDNA change from G to A at position 158 (G158A).
- A30P: Alanine (A) to Proline (P) at position 30, which corresponds to a cDNA change from C to T at position 89 (C89T).
- E46K: Glutamic acid (E) to Lysine (K) at position 46, which corresponds to a cDNA change from G to A at position 136 (G136A).
