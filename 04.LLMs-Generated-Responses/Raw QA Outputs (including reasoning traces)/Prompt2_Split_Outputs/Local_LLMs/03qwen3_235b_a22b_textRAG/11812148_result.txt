``` Based on the provided input text paragraph, the literature mentions two specific missense mutations in the a-Synuclein gene: A53T and A30P. These mutations are linked to early onset familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, the text describes a double mutant A53T/A30P. However, the focus is on the protein changes rather than specific cDNA changes. Therefore, the extracted information reflects the protein-level mutations with their respective positions. The cDNA changes are not explicitly mentioned in the text, so they are marked as "N.D." (not determined).

``` Based on the provided input text paragraph, the literature mentions two specific missense mutations in the a-Synuclein gene: A53T and A30P. These mutations are linked to early onset familial Parkinson's disease (PD). The text also refers to a double mutant (A53T/A30P), which combines both mutations. Since the user's goal is to extract all mutation details, including combinations, the double mutant is included here. The cDNA changes are not explicitly described in the text, so they are marked as "N.D." (not determined). The protein changes and their positions are clearly stated, so they are included in the JSON output. Each mutation, including the double mutant, is listed separately to ensure comprehensive coverage of the described variants.
