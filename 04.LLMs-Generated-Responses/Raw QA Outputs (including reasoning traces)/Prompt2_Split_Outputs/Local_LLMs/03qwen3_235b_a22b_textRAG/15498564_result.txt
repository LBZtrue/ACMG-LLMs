Context:
lein in pRK172 have been described [29]. Mutation E46K in a-synuclein was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis with QuikChange (Stratagene), followed by DNA sequencing. Bacterial expression and purification of a-synuclein, as well as procedures for immunoblotting, were as described [14]. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative 

## abstract:
Missense mutations (A30P and A53T) in a-synuclein and the overproduction of the wild-type protein cause familial forms of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. a-Synuclein is the major component of the filamentous Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that define these diseases at a neuropathological level. Recently, a third misse

escribed [14]. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. For constructs encoding N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion tags, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the coding region of human a-synuclein, A30P a-synuclein, E46K a-synuclein and A53T a-synuclein in bacterial expression vector 

Question:
 
- Role: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert
- Background: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. The user aims to quickly and accurately identify whether the literature contains mutation information and extract relevant details.
- Profile: You are an expert with extensive experience in the field of medical literature data mining, familiar with the structure and terminology of biomedical literature, and skilled at precisely extracting key information from large volumes of text.
- Skills: You possess strong text analysis capabilities, a deep understanding of biomedical terminology, and proficient use of data mining techniques, enabling you to quickly identify and extract mutation information from literature.
- Goals: Determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations. If it does, extract relevant details; if not, return "N.D.".
- Constraints: Extract only information directly related to mutations, ensure the extracted information is accurate, and use "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
- Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
- Workflow:
  1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
  2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
  3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

- Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
- Workflow:
  1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
  2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
  3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

## abstract:
Missense mutations (A30P and A53T) in a-synuclein and the overproduction of the wild-type protein cause familial forms of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. a-Synuclein is the major component of the filamentous Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that define these diseases at a neuropathological level. Recently, a third misse

Context:
lein in pRK172 have been described [29]. Mutation E46K in a-synuclein was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis with QuikChange (Stratagene), followed by DNA sequencing. Bacterial expression and purification of a-synuclein, as well as procedures for immunoblotting, were as described [14]. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative 

## abstract:
Missense mutations (A30P and A53T) in a-synuclein and the overproduction of the wild-type protein cause familial forms of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. a-Synuclein is the major component of the filamentous Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that define these diseases at a neuropathological level. Recently, a third misse

escribed [14]. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. For constructs encoding N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion tags, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the coding region of human a-synuclein, A30P a-synuclein, E46K a-synuclein and A53T a-synuclein in bacterial expression vector 

Question:
 
- Role: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert
- Background: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. The user aims to quickly and accurately identify whether the literature contains mutation information and extract relevant details.
- Profile: You are an expert with extensive experience in the field of medical literature data mining, familiar with the structure and terminology of biomedical literature, and skilled at precisely extracting key information from large volumes of text.
- Skills: You possess strong text analysis capabilities, a deep understanding of biomedical terminology, and proficient use of data mining techniques, enabling you to quickly identify and extract mutation information from literature.
- Goals: Determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations. If it does, extract relevant details; if not, return "N.D.".
- Constraints: Extract only information directly related to mutations, ensure the extracted information is accurate, and use "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
- Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
- Workflow:
  1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
  2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
  3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."
    Extracted Information:

Context:
lein in pRK172 have been described [29]. Mutation E46K in a-synuclein was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis with QuikChange (Stratagene), followed by DNA sequencing. Bacterial expression and purification of a-synuclein, as well as procedures for immunoblotting, were as described [14]. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative 

## abstract:
Missense mutations (A30P and A53T) in a-synuclein and the overproduction of the wild-type protein cause familial forms of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. a-Synuclein is the major component of the filamentous Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that define these diseases at a neuropathological level. Recently, a third misse

escribed [14]. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. For constructs encoding N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion tags, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the coding region of human a-synuclein, A30P a-synuclein, E46K a-synuclein and A53T a-synuclein in bacterial expression vector 

Question:
 
- Role: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert
- Background: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. The user aims to quickly and accurately identify whether the literature contains mutation information and extract relevant details.
