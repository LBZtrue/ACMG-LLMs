``` Based on the provided input text, the literature mentions a specific mutation in the DJ-1 gene, designated as L166P. This mutation is associated with the onset of familial Parkinson's disease (PD, PARK7). The mutation involves a substitution of leucine (L) with proline (P) at position 166 in the protein sequence. However, the text does not provide specific details regarding the cDNA change, such as the transcript, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, or position. Therefore, these fields are marked as "N.D." in the JSON output.
