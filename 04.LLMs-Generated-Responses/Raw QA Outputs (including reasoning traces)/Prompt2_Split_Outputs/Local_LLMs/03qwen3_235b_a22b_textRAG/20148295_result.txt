``` Based on the given context, the gene mentioned is αSyn. Two entries are created for the variants since there are two relevant pieces of information regarding mutations. The first variant refers to the truncated αSyn proteins forming oligomers more quickly than the wildtype protein, while the second variant refers to the presence of three disease-associated mutations. However, specific cDNA and protein changes are not provided in the context, so they are marked as "N.D.".

The first variant refers to the truncated αSyn proteins forming oligomers more quickly than the wildtype protein, while the second variant refers to the presence of three disease-associated mutations. However, specific cDNA and protein changes are not provided in the context, so they are marked as "N.D.".

``` Based on the given context, the gene mentioned is αSyn. Two entries are created for the variants since there are two relevant pieces of information regarding mutations. The first variant refers to the truncated αSyn proteins forming oligomers more quickly than the wildtype protein, while the second variant refers to the presence of three disease-associated mutations. However, specific cDNA and protein changes are not provided in the context, so they are marked as "N.D.".
