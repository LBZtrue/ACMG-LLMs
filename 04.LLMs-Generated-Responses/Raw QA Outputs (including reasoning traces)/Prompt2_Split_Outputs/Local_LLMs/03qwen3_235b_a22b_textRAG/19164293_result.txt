Based on the provided context, the literature mentions three mutations: A30P, E46K, and A53T. These mutations are described in terms of their protein changes but no specific gene is named in the text. Additionally, there is no information provided about the cDNA changes related to these mutations. Each mutation is detailed with the reference amino acid, the alternate amino acid, and their respective positions. The descriptions of these mutations are directly mentioned in the input context.

The JSON structure provided includes the gene, which is not explicitly named in the text and is therefore marked as "N.D." Each variant includes the cDNA change, which is not specified in the text and thus marked as "N.D." for each component, the protein change with reference amino acid, alternate amino acid, and position, and the description of the mutation as it appears in the input context.

The output adheres to the constraints and format requirements specified, ensuring that only information directly related to mutations is extracted, and any content not mentioned is supplemented with "N.D." The JSON structure is complete and includes all three mutations mentioned in the input text.

The answer is correctly formatted in JSON and includes all the necessary information about the mutations mentioned in the input context, adhering to the workflow and constraints provided.
