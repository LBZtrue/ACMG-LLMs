``` Based on the information provided in the text, the gene involved is ␣S (alpha-synuclein), and there are three PD (Parkinson's disease)-linked mutants mentioned: A30P, E46K, and A53T. These mutations are described in terms of protein changes, with the original amino acid, the altered amino acid, and the position in the protein sequence. The cDNA changes are not explicitly mentioned in the text, so they are marked as "N.D." (not determined). Each mutation is described with its respective protein change and position, and the descriptions in the input context are provided as well.
