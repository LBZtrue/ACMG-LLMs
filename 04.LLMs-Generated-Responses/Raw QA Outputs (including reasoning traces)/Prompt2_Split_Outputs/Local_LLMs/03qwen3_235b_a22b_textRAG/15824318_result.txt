``` Based on the provided context, two mutations were mentioned: G309D and L347P. However, there was no explicit information about the gene or the cDNA changes (e.g., transcript, reference and alternative nucleotides, and positions) in the text. Therefore, the gene and cDNA change fields were filled with "N.D." as they were not specified in the input context. The protein changes and their respective positions were clearly stated for both mutations, and these were captured in the JSON output. Each mutation was included as a separate object within the "variants" array, maintaining the required structure and accuracy based on the information provided in the input context.
