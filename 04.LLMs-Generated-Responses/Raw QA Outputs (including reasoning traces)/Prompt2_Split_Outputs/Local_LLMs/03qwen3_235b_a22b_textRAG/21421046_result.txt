##Preparation of recombinant adenoviruses containing cDNA of wild-type or PARK6 mutant PINK1
Influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA, YPYDVPDYA) was added to the C-terminus of human wild-type PINK1 by performing PCR amplification. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using PCR amplification was performed to prepare cDNA

ology and test the hypothesis that PARK6 mutations cause the loss of PINK1 function.

##Materials and methods


##Generation of PINK1-deficient mice
BAC clone containing the mouse PINK1 gene was obtained from Invitrogen. To target the exon 1 of PINK1, 1.1-and 5.9-kb DNA fragments surrounding the exon 1 were prepared by performing PCR amplification

##Preparation of recombinant adenoviruses containing cDNA of wild-type or PARK6 mutant PINK1
Influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA, YPYDVPDYA) was added to the C-terminus of human wild-type PINK1 by performing PCR amplification. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using PCR amplification was performed to prepare cDNA

ology and test the hypothesis that PARK6 mutations cause the loss of PINK1 function.

##Materials and methods


##Generation of PINK1-deficient mice
BAC clone containing the mouse PINK1 gene was obtained from Invitrogen. To target the exon 1 of PINK1, 1.1-and 5.9-kb DNA fragments surrounding the exon 1 were prepared by performing PCR amplification
