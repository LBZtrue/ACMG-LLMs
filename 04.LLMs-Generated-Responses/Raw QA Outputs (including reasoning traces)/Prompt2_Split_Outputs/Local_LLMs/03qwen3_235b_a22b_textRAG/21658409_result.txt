``` Based on the input context, the literature mentions three missense mutations for a-Syn (A30P, A53T, and E46K) associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial PD. The JSON output includes these mutations with their respective protein changes. However, the cDNA changes are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so they are filled with "N.D." as required.
Given the input context, the literature mentions three missense mutations for a-Syn (A30P, A53T, and E46K) associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial PD. These mutations are described at the protein level, but the corresponding cDNA changes are not explicitly provided in the text.

The JSON output is structured as follows:
- **Gene**: The gene involved is "a-Syn".
- **Variants**:
  - **A30P**: The protein change is from alanine (A) to proline (P) at position 30.
  - **A53T**: The protein change is from alanine (A) to threonine (T) at position 53.
  - **E46K**: The protein change is from glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K) at position 46.

For each variant, since the cDNA changes are not mentioned in the input context, they are marked as "N.D." as per the constraints provided.

This JSON output adheres to the specified format and includes all relevant mutation information extracted directly from the literature.
