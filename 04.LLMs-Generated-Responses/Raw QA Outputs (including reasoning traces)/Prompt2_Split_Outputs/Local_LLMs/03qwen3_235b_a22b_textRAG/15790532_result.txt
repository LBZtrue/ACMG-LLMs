``` The provided JSON response accurately captures the mutation information from the input literature. The gene is DJ-1, and several variants are mentioned, including point mutations and a deletion. Each variant's protein change and description are detailed, while unspecified cDNA changes are marked as "N.D.".

To ensure completeness and adherence to the format, the following points have been addressed:

- **Gene:** DJ-1 is the gene of interest.
- **Variants:** Six variants are described:
  1. **L166P:** A point mutation where leucine (L) at position 166 is replaced by proline (P).
  2. **R98Q:** A point mutation where arginine (R) at position 98 is replaced by glutamine (Q).
  3. **A104T:** A point mutation where alanine (A) at position 104 is replaced by threonine (T).
  4. **D149A:** A point mutation where aspartic acid (D) at position 149 is replaced by alanine (A).
  5. **M26I:** A point mutation where methionine (M) at position 26 is replaced by isoleucine (I).
  6. **Deletion of the first five exons:** This variant results in a loss of gene function due to the deletion of a significant portion of the gene, but no specific protein change is provided.

The JSON structure includes all required fields, and "N.D." is used where information is not explicitly mentioned. The data is presented in a clear and structured manner, adhering to the specified format.
