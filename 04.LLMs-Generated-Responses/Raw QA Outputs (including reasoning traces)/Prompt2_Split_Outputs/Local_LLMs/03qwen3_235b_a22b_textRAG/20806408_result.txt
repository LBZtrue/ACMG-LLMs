```Based on the information provided, the JSON output has been generated as follows:

1. The gene mentioned in the input context is "DJ-1".
2. There are two variants described in the input context:
   a. The first variant is an L10P amino acid substitution. This indicates that the leucine (L) residue at position 10 is replaced by a proline (P) residue. However, no specific cDNA change information is provided in the input context.
   b. The second variant involves the deletion of residue P158 in DJ-1. This implies that the proline (P) residue at position 158 is deleted from the protein sequence. Again, no specific cDNA change information is provided in the input context.
3. For both variants, the cDNA change information is not mentioned in the input context, so it is represented as "N.D." (not determined) in the JSON output.
4. The protein change information for each variant is extracted directly from the input context, with the reference residue, alternate residue (if applicable), and position specified accordingly.
5. The description in the input context for each variant is also included in the JSON output as provided.

Overall, the JSON output accurately captures the mutation information described in the input context, adhering to the specified format and constraints. Where information is not explicitly mentioned, it is appropriately marked as "N.D." to indicate that it is not determined. ```json

```Based on the information provided, the JSON output has been generated as follows:

1. The gene mentioned in the input context is "DJ-1".
2. There are two variants described in the input context:
   a. The first variant is an L10P amino acid substitution. This indicates that the leucine (L) residue at position 10 is replaced by a proline (P) residue. However, no specific cDNA change information is provided in the input context.
   b. The second variant involves the deletion of residue P158 in DJ-1. This implies that the proline (P) residue at position 158 is deleted from the protein sequence. Again, no specific cDNA change information is provided in the input context.
3. For both variants, the cDNA change information is not mentioned in the input context, so it is represented as "N.D." (not determined) in the JSON output.
4. The protein change information for each variant is extracted directly from the input context, with the reference residue, alternate residue (if applicable), and position specified accordingly.
5. The description in the input context for each variant is also included in the JSON output as provided.

Overall, the JSON output accurately captures the mutation information described in the input context, adhering to the specified format and constraints. Where information is not explicitly mentioned, it is appropriately marked as "N.D." to indicate that it is not determined. ```json

Based on the information provided, the JSON output has been generated as follows:

1. The gene mentioned in the input context is "DJ-1".
2. There are two variants described in the input context:
   a. The first variant is an L10P amino acid substitution. This indicates that the leucine (L) residue at position 10 is replaced by a proline (P) residue. However, no specific cDNA change information is provided in the input context.
   b. The second variant involves the deletion of residue P158 in DJ-1. This implies that the proline (P) residue at position 158 is deleted from the protein sequence. Again, no specific cDNA change information is provided in the input context.
3. For both variants, the cDNA change information is not mentioned in the input context, so it is represented as "N.D." (not determined) in the JSON output.
4. The protein change information for each variant is extracted directly from the input context, with the reference residue, alternate residue (if applicable), and position specified accordingly.
5. The description in the input context for each variant is also included in the JSON output as provided.

Overall, the JSON output accurately captures the mutation information described in the input context, adhering to the specified format and constraints. Where information is not explicitly mentioned, it is appropriately marked as "N.D." to indicate that it is not determined. ```json
