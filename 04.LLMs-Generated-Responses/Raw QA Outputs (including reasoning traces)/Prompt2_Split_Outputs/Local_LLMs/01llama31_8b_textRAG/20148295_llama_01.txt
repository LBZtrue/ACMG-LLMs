After carefully reading the input text paragraph, I have identified mutation-related terms and extracted relevant information.

The input text paragraph is from the abstract of a medical literature article related to Parkinson's disease.

Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "A30P", 
        "alt": "N.D.", 
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "30"
      },
      "Description in input context": "Three point mutations in αSyn are associated with early-onset familial PD: A30P, E46K, and A53T."
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "E46K", 
        "alt": "N.D.", 
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "E",
        "alt": "K",
        "position": "46"
      },
      "Description in input context": "Three point mutations in αSyn are associated with early-onset familial PD: A30P, E46K, and A53T."
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "A53T", 
        "alt": "N.D.", 
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "53"
      },
      "Description in input context": "Three point mutations in αSyn are associated with early-onset familial PD: A30P, E46K, and A53T."
    }
  ]
}
