Based on the provided literature, I have extracted information related to mutations.

Here is the extracted information in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "DJ-1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "L166P"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Description in input context": "mutations in DJ-1 gene include a large deletion, the mutations cause Parkinsonism, probably through a loss of DJ-1 protein or function [2]. The L166P mutant DJ-1 was used."
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: The cDNA change and protein change for L166P mutation is not explicitly mentioned in the literature. I have supplemented it with "N.D." to ensure that all required fields are present in the output.
