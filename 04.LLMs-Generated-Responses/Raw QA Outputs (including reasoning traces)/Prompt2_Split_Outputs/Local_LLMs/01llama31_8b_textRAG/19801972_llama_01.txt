Based on the provided medical literature, I will extract information related to mutations and return it in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
  "Gene": "parkin",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.A.",
        "alt": "N.A.",
        "position": "N.A."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.A.",
        "alt": "N.A.",
        "position": "N.A."
      },
      "Description in input context": "familial parkin missense and mutations"
    }
  ]
}
```

The extracted information indicates that the literature discusses mutations associated with autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson's disease (AR-JP) and their impact on the function of the ubiquitin ligase parkin. However, specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions related to these mutations are not mentioned in detail.

Since the input text does not provide specific information about the cDNA or protein changes caused by the familial parkin missense and mutations, I used "N.D." (Not Determined) for those fields.
