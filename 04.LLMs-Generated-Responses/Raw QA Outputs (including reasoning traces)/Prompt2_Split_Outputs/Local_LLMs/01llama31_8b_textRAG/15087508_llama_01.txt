Based on the provided literature, there is no direct mention of mutations or genetic information that meets the specified format requirements.

The article discusses hereditary early-onset Parkinson's disease caused by mutations in PINK1. However, it does not provide detailed gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions as requested.

Therefore, I will supplement the content with "N.D." (Not Determined) to ensure that the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.

The extracted information in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "Gene": "PINK1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "Hereditary early-onset Parkinson's disease"
        }
    ]
}
