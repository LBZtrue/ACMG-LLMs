Based on the provided literature snippet, I have identified mutation-related information and extracted relevant details in the specified JSON format.

Input Text:
"The Cu(II)-R-synuclein interaction has been invoked as an important process in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. Herein, we report binding constants and stoichiometry under near-physiological conditions for the binding of Cu(II) to human R-synuclein. Specifically, we compare the binding of Cu(II) to wild-type (WT) protein and two separate single mutation proteins that are associated with familial Parkinson’s diseases: A30P and A53T."

Extracted Information:

Note that the extracted information is based on the text snippet provided, and it includes gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions of mutations. The values for cDNA change are marked as "N.D." because they are not explicitly mentioned in the input text.
