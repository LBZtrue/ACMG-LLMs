Based on the provided text, I have identified that it contains information related to mutations. Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "α-synuclein (α-syn)",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "A30P",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "A30P",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "Mutations in the N-terminus of the gene encoding α-synuclein (α-syn) are linked to autosomal dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD)."
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the extracted information is based on the text provided and may not be comprehensive or complete. The "N.D." values indicate that specific details such as transcript position, reference base, alternate base, and protein position are not mentioned in the input text.
