Here is the extracted information related to mutations from the provided literature text:

```json
{
  "Gene": [
    {
      "LRRK2"
    },
    {
      "dLRRK",
      "hLRRK2"
    }
  ],
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "I1915T",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "I",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "I1915T"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "G2019S",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "S",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "G2019S"
    }
  ],
  "Mutations": [
    "I1915T mutation of LRRK2",
    "G2019S mutation of hLRRK2"
  ]
}
```

Note that some details, such as the transcript position for cDNA changes or the specific protein change description for I1915T and G2019S mutations, are not explicitly mentioned in the text. Therefore, "N.D." is used to supplement these content areas according to the constraints provided.
