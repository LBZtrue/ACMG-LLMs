Based on the provided text paragraph, I will extract the mutation-related information and format it according to the specified JSON template.

The input text paragraph is:

"The pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease Introduction
The pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease
(PD) and several other neurodegenerative disorders
is the deposition of intracytoplasmic neuronal inclu-
sions termed Lewy bodies.1 The major components
of Lewy bodies are amyloid fibrils of the protein a-
synuclein (aS).2 Three separate mutations (A30P, synuclein (aS).2 Three separate mutations (A30P,
E46K, and A53T) as well as duplications or triplica-
tions of the aS gene, which increase levels of aS
with no alteration in sequence, cause PD.3–5 While
dopaminergic nerve cell loss clearly is linked to
enhanced aS aggregation, oligomeric intermediates enhanced aS aggregation, oligomeric intermediates
might be the most toxic species.6 However, due to
their transient and heterogeneous nature they are
difficult to characterize.7,8
Since their discovery, the three disease-related
aS mutants have been the subject of intense study, as
differences in aggregation behavior and morphology differences in aggregation behavior and morphology
with respect to the wild-type (wt) form may yield val-
uable insights into the fundamental processes under-
lying amyloidogenic diseases.3,9–24 As in the case of
wt aS, all three mutants are natively unfolded in
aqueous solution,20 although the propensities for re-
