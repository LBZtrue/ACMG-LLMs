Based on the provided medical literature, I will extract information related to mutations and present it in the specified JSON format.

The extracted information is as follows:

```json
{
  "Gene": "DJ-1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "L",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "L",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Description in input context": "L166P mutation destabilizes the protein and thus produces an effective knockout of the gene."
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "M",
        "alt": "I",
        "position": "26"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "M",
        "alt": "I",
        "position": "26"
      },
      "Description in input context": "M26I point mutation was also unstable."
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "R",
        "alt": "Q",
        "position": "98"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "R",
        "alt": "Q",
        "position": "98"
      },
      "Description in input context": "R98Q variant was generally stable."
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that I have supplemented missing information with "N.D." as per the requirements.
