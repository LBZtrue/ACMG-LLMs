Based on the provided literature, I have carefully read and analyzed the text to extract relevant information related to mutations.

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "mutations found throughout the gene including the kinase domain"
    }
  ],
  "Mutations' impact on cell phenotype": [
    {
      "phenotype": "formation of inclusion bodies",
      "impact on cells": "increase in tendency to form inclusion bodies"
    },
    {
      "phenotype": "cell death",
      "impact on cells": "neurons and neuronal cell lines undergo cell death after expression of mutant protein"
    }
  ],
  "Mutations' impact on kinase activity": [
    {
      "kinase activity importance": "required for the damaging effects of pathogenic mutations",
      "manipulation impact": "replacing the kinase domain with a Fkinase-dead version blocks inclusion body formation and strongly delays cell death"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this extracted information, I have included the gene name (LRRK2), mutation-related terms ("mutations found throughout the gene including the kinase domain"), specific phenotypic effects associated with mutant LRRK2 (formation of inclusion bodies and cell death), and the impact of manipulating kinase activity on these effects.
