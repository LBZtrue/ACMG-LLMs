Based on the provided text paragraph, I have extracted relevant information related to mutations and formatted it according to the specified JSON template.

```json
{
  "Gene": "PARK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "C",
        "alt": "G",
        "position": "289"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "C",
        "alt": "G",
        "position": "289"
      },
      "Description in input context": "Parkin RING domain mutant (C289G)"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this extracted information, the gene mentioned is PARK2, which encodes the Parkin protein. The cDNA change described is a mutation at position 289 where a cytosine (C) is replaced by guanine (G). Similarly, the protein change is also described as a replacement of cysteine (C) with glycine (G) at position 289 in the Parkin protein.
