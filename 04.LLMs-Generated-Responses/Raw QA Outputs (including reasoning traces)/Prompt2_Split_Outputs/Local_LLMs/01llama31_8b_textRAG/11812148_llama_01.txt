Based on the provided medical literature text, I will extract information related to mutations.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
```markdown
a-Synuclein (a-Syn) is an abundant presynaptic protein of unknown function, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. a-Syn has been suggested to play a role in lipid transport and synaptogenesis, and growing evidence suggests that a-Syn interactions with cellular membranes are physiologically important. In the current study, we demonstrate that the familial Parkinson's disease-linked A30P mutant a-Syn is defective in binding to phospholipid vesicles in vitro as determined by vesicle ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and low-angle X-ray diffraction.

**Extracted Information:**

```json
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "30"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "30"
      },
      "Description in input context": "familial Parkinson's disease-linked A30P mutant a-Syn"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The extracted information is based on the text that directly mentions mutations, specifically the A30P mutation in the SNCA gene.
