      "Description in input context": [
        "E46K αS accelerated the kinetics of the secondary structure change and oligomerization, whereas A30P αS decelerated them. These effects were reflected in changes in average oligomer size. The mutant oligomers of E46K αS functioned as fibril seeds significantly more efficiently than those of WT αS, whereas the mutant oligomers of A30P αS were less efficient."
