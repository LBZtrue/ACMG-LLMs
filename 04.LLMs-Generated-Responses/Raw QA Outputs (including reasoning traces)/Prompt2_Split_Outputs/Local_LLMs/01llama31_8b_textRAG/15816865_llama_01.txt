Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "parkin",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "22 mutations"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "more than half of parkin mutants produce alteration in the solubility of parkin"
    }
  ],
  "mutation location": "outside of the parkin RING fingers",
  "effect on protein": "alterations in solubility and intracellular localization may underlie the molecular basis of the loss of function caused by several of its mutations."
}
```

Note that there is no specific gene mutation mentioned, so we used "N.D." for cDNA change, protein change, and position. The location of the mutation is outside of the parkin RING fingers, which affects the solubility and intracellular localization of the protein.
