Based on the provided medical literature, I have extracted relevant information related to mutations.

```json
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "E46K",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "E",
        "alt": "K",
        "position": "46"
      },
      "Description in input context": "Missense mutation E46K in a-synuclein"
    }
  ],
  "Pathogenicity": "The observed effects on lipid binding and filament assembly may explain the pathogenic nature of the E46K mutation in a-synuclein."
}
```

Note: Since the provided literature does not explicitly mention the effects of A30P and A53T mutations, I have only extracted information related to the E46K mutation.
