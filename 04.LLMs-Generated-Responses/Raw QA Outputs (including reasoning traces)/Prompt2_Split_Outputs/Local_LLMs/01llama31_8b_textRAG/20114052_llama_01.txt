Here is the extracted information related to mutations from the provided text paragraph:

```json
{
    "Gene": "α-synuclein",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "K",
                "position": "46"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "K",
                "position": "E46K"
            },
            "Description in input context": "The mutation site 46 linked to a familial form of PD (E46K)"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that the gene name, cDNA change, protein change, and description are extracted from the text paragraph. The transcript is left as "N.D." since it's not specified in the input context.
