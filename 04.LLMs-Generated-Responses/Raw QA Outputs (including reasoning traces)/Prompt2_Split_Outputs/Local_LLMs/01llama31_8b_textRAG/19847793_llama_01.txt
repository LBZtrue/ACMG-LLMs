Based on the provided literature, I will extract information related to mutations and present it in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "Mutants in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain"
    }
  ],
  "Mutation Type": "Heterozygous",
  "Effect on Cells": "Increased rate of apoptosis, decrease in DCm, and increased time-dependent cell loss when subjected to oxidative stress",
  "Experiment Outcome": "Provided the first experimental evidence that clinically reported PINK1 heterozygous mutations exert a gene dosage effect"
}
```

Note: Some fields such as transcript position, ref and alt for cDNA change and protein change are not provided in the text. Hence, I have used "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
