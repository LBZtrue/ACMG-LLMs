Based on the provided article, I will extract information related to mutations and provide it in the specified JSON format.

The article discusses how PD-associated mutations compromise the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Here is the extracted information:

```json
{
  "Gene": [
    {
      "PINK1",
      "Parkin"
    }
  ],
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "PD-associated mutations compromise the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy"
}
```

Note that there is no specific gene or mutation mentioned in the article, only a general description of PD-associated mutations. Therefore, I have used "N.D." to supplement content not mentioned.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements!
