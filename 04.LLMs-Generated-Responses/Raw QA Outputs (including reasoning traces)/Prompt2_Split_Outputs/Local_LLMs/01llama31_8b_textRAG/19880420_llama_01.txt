Based on the provided medical literature, I will extract information related to mutations and format it according to the specified JSON template.

```json
{
  "Gene": [
    {
      "Name": "parkin",
      "Type": "PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)",
      "Description in input context": "homozygous mutations"
    },
    {
      "Name": "parkin",
      "Description in input context": "heterozygous mutations"
    }
  ],
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson disease (PD)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: The extracted information is based on the provided text, and I have supplemented content not mentioned with "N.D." according to the format requirements.
