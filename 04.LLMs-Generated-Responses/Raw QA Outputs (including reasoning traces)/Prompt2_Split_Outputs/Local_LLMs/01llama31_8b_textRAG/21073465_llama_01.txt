Based on the provided text, I have extracted relevant information related to mutations. Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "Y1699C",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "Y1699C",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "The LRRK2 Y1699C pathogenic mutation"
    }
  ]
}
```

This extracted information includes the gene name (LRRK2), a single variant with its cDNA change, protein change, and description as mentioned in the text. The cDNA position is marked as N.D. since it's not explicitly stated in the provided paragraph.
