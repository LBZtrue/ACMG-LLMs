Based on the provided literature, I was able to extract the following information related to mutations:

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "Y1699C",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "C",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "mutants such as Y1699C"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "G2019S",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "S",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "mutants such as G2019S"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that for the position of the variants, I used "N.D." since it was not explicitly mentioned in the text.
