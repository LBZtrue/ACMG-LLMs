Based on the provided literature, I will extract information related to mutations and return it in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "1441, 1699, 2019"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "R",
        "alt": "G (at position 1441), Y (at position 1699), S (at position 2019)"
      },
      "Description in input context": "Common PD-related mutations of LRRK2, R1441G, Y1699C and G2019S"
    }
  ]
}
```

The extracted information includes the gene name "LRRK2", variants with their corresponding cDNA changes (referring to nucleotide positions) and protein changes for the mentioned mutations. The description in the input context is also provided as per the requirement.
