Based on the provided literature excerpt, I have extracted relevant information related to mutations.

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "mutations do not affect PINK1 dimerization and its associated complexes"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: Since the provided text excerpt does not explicitly mention specific mutations or cDNA/protein changes, I have supplemented the extracted information with "N.D." (Not Determined) to ensure the returned format meets the requirements.
