Based on the provided text, I will extract information related to mutations.

```json
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "A53T",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "A53T mutant Isoform of Alpha-Synuclein"
    }
  ]
}
```

This extracted information corresponds to the A53T mutation in the SNCA gene, which is associated with Parkinson's disease.
