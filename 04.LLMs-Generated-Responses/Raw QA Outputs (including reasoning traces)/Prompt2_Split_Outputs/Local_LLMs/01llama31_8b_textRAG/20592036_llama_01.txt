Based on the provided literature excerpt, I will extract information related to mutations. Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "α-Synuclein (αS)",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "three αS point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism"
    }
  ]
}
```

However, the literature excerpt only mentions the existence of three α-Synuclein (αS) point mutations without specifying their exact descriptions. Therefore, I have supplemented the extracted information with "N.D." where specific mutation details were not mentioned.

Please note that there is no explicit description of the cDNA change and protein change for these mutants in the literature excerpt provided.
