Based on the provided text, I have extracted information related to mutations.

The input text paragraph is:
"Following our identiﬁcation of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 Following our identiﬁcation of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1
(PINK1) gene mutations in PARK6-linked Parkinson’s disease
(PD), we have recently reported that PINK1 protein localizes to
Lewy bodies (LBs) in PD brains. We have used a cellular model
system of LBs, namely induction of aggresomes, to determine system of LBs, namely induction of aggresomes, to determine
how a mitochondrial protein, such as PINK1, can localize to
aggregates. Using speciﬁc polyclonal antibodies, we ﬁrstly
demonstrated that human PINK1 was cleaved and localized to
mitochondria."

The extracted information is:

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "PINK1 gene mutations"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the mutation information is limited to the mention of PINK1 gene mutations, without specifying any cDNA or protein changes. The "cDNA Change" and "Protein Change" fields are supplemented with "N.D." as they were not mentioned in the input text paragraph.
