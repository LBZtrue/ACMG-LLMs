Based on the provided medical literature paragraph, I have identified mutation-related terms and extracted relevant details as per the specified format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.A.",
        "alt": "N.A.",
        "position": "N.A."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.A.",
        "alt": "A53T",
        "position": "N.A."
      },
      "Description in input context": "mutant A53T -synuclein"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the extracted information, I have included the gene name "SNCA" and a single variant description related to the mutant A53T -synuclein. Since specific cDNA or protein changes are not mentioned for this particular mutation in the input text, these fields remain incomplete with "N.D." indicating that the information is not directly available from the literature. The position of the mutation is also unknown as it is described by the mutation name (A53T) rather than a numerical position.
