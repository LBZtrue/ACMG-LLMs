Based on the provided literature, I have extracted the following information related to mutations:

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "2020"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "I",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "2020"
      },
      "Description in input context": "I2020T mutation"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "S",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "2019"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "2019"
      },
      "Description in input context": "G2019S mutation"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the provided literature does not mention specific transcript information for the variants, so I have left it as "N.D." in the extracted data.
