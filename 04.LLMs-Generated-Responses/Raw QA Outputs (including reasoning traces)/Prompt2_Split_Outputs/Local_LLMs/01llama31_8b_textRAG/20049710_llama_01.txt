Based on the provided medical literature, I have extracted relevant details related to mutations.

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": "N.D.",
      "Protein Change": "N.D.",
      "Description in input context": "Mutations of the mitochondrial PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue)-induced kinase1 (PINK1) are important causes of recessive Parkinson disease (PD)."
    }
  ],
  "mutation_impact": "Impact on Complex I activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in mitochondrial depolarization and increased sensitivity to apoptotic stress",
  "additional_details": {
    "Mechanism": "Decreased Complex I activity leading to mitochondrial dysfunction",
    "clinical_relevance": "Human wild type PINK1 can rescue Complex 1 deficiency"
  }
}
```

Note that the mutation description is quite general, so it might not meet your requirements. However, based on the information provided in the literature, this is what I was able to extract.
