Based on the provided text, I will extract information related to mutations and provide it in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "53"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "53"
      },
      "Description in input context": "p.Ala53Thr"
    }
  ],
  "Monoallelic Expression": true,
  "Epigenetic Silencing": "Histone modifications but not DNA methylation",
  "Upregulation of Wild-Type Allele": true
}
```

Note: The output format is based on the examples provided and includes specific fields for gene, variants (with cDNA change and protein change), and additional details related to mutation description. For the content that was not mentioned in the literature, I have used "N.D." as per the specified workflow.
