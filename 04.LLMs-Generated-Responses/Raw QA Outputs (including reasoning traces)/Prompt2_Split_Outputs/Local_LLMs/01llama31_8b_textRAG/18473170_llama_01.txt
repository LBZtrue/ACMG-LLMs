Based on the provided literature, here is the extracted information related to mutations:

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "W",
        "alt": "X",
        "position": "437"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "homozygous W437X nonsense mutation"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the protein change description is incomplete as it only mentions a nonsense mutation but does not specify any amino acid changes. The gene name, PINK1, and cDNA change are accurately extracted.
