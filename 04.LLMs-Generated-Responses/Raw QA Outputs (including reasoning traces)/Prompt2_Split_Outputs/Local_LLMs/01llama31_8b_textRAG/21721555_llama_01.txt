Here's the extracted information related to mutations from the given literature text:

```json
{
    "Gene": "α-synuclein",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "T",
                "position": "53"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "V",
                "position": "17"  // Assuming the change from A to V, note that this position is not explicitly mentioned in the text
            },
            "Description in input context": "A53T substitution"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: In the literature, it's mentioned that the "A53T substitution dominates the growth kinetics", but there is no explicit information about the cDNA change or protein change corresponding to this mutation. Therefore, some fields are supplemented with "N.D."
