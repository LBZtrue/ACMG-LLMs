Based on the provided literature text, I will extract information related to mutations.

The relevant paragraph is:

"The disease-associated mutations, R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T, exhibited reduced interaction with, and phosphorylation of, Akt1, suggesting one possible mechanism for the neurodegeneration caused by LRRK2 mutations."

From this paragraph, we can extract the following mutation information in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "C",
        "position": "1441"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "R",
        "alt": "C",
        "position": "1441"
      },
      "Description in input context": "R1441C"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "S",
        "position": "2019"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "S",
        "position": "2019"
      },
      "Description in input context": "G2019S"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "2020"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "I",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "2020"
      },
      "Description in input context": "I2020T"
    }
  ]
}
```

The extracted information includes the gene LRRK2, its variants with their cDNA and protein changes, and descriptions of each mutation as mentioned in the literature.
