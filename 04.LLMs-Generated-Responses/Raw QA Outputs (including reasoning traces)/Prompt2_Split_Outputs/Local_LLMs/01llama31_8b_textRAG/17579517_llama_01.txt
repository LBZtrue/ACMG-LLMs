Based on the provided text paragraph, I have identified information related to mutations and extracted relevant details.

The paragraph mentions "mutations in the PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene" that cause an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson disease (PD). Specifically, it highlights two homozygous PINK1 mutations: a truncating nonsense mutation (W437X) and a G309D missense mutation. Additionally, multiple other types of PD-linked mutations or truncations in PINK1 have been reported.

Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "W",
        "alt": "X",
        "position": "437"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "description": "truncating nonsense mutation (W437X)"
      }
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "D",
        "position": "309"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "description": "missense mutation (G309D)"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that I have only extracted information related to the PINK1 gene and its associated mutations, as per the input text paragraph. For content not mentioned in the paragraph, such as protein descriptions or amino acid positions for other mutations, I have supplemented with "N.D."
