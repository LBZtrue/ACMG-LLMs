Based on the provided text, I will extract information related to mutations.

```json
{
  "Gene": "DJ1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "NM_007262.3 (mRNA)",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "C",
        "position": "192"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "E64",
        "alt": "D"
      },
      "Description in input context": "third mutation, c.192G>C (p.E64D)"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this output, I have extracted the following information:

- Gene: DJ1
- Variants:
  - cDNA Change:
    - Transcript: NM_007262.3 (mRNA)
    - Reference base (ref): G
    - Alternative base (alt): C
    - Position: 192
  - Protein Change:
    - Reference amino acid (ref): E64
    - Alternative amino acid (alt): D
  - Description in input context: third mutation, c.192G>C (p.E64D)
