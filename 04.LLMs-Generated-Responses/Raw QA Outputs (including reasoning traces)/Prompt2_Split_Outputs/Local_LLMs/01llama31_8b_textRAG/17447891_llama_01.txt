Here's the extracted information from the provided medical literature text in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [

      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "G2019S, R1941H, I2012T, I2020T, G2385R, R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C, T2356I"

      },
      "Description in input context": "Mutations in LRRK2 gene cause late-onset PD. We undertook a KESTREL screen to identify proteins that were phosphorylated by an activated PD mutant of LRRK2 (G2019S). Four mutations inhibited LRRK2 kinase activity (R1941H, I2012T, I2020T and G2385R)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: The extracted information includes the gene name "LRRK2", variants with their respective cDNA and protein changes, along with descriptions in the input context. However, some fields like transcript position are left as "N.D." because they were not mentioned in the provided text.
