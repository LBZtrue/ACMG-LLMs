Based on the provided literature excerpt, I have extracted relevant information related to mutations.

```
{
  "Gene": ["DJ-1"],
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "D149A",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "D149A mutation"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "L166P",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "L166P mutation"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that for the mutations D149A and L166P, specific details about protein changes or positions are not provided. However, based on the literature excerpt, it can be inferred that these mutations affect DJ-1 function.
