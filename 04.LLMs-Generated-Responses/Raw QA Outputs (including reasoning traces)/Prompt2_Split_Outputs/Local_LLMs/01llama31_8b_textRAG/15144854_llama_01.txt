Based on the provided literature, I have extracted relevant details related to mutations.

```json
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "53"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "A53T mutation in the a-synuclein gene"
    }
  ],
  "Mutation Type": "Point mutation",
  "Impact on Protein Function": "Altered a-syn structure and accelerated fibril formation"
}
```

The literature indicates that the A53T mutation in the SNCA gene leads to altered a-synuclein structure and accelerates its fibril formation, which may contribute to Parkinson's disease pathology.
