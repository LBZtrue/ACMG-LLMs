Based on the input text paragraph, I can determine that it contains information related to mutations.

Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "Loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and Parkin cause parkinsonism in humans and mitochondrial dysfunction in model organisms."
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the extracted information is limited due to the lack of specific mutation descriptions or gene names other than "PINK1" and "Parkin". The fields for cDNA change, protein change, and description are supplemented with "N.D." (Not Determined) as they are not mentioned in the input text paragraph.
