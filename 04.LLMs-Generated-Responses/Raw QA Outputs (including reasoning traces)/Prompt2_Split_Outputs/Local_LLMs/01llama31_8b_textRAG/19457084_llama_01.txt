The provided text does not mention mutations, gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, or mutation descriptions related to Parkinson's disease.

However, the text mentions "a-synuclein contributes to neurotoxicity in a host of human neurodegenerative disorders referred collectively as synucleinopathies" which implies that a-synuclein is involved in mutations or genetic alterations.

To extract relevant information, I will provide the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "a-synuclein",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "contributes to neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: As the text does not provide specific mutation information, the extracted details are supplemented with "N.D." to ensure completeness.
