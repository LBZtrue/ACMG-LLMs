Based on the provided literature snippet, I have identified information related to mutations and extracted relevant details according to the specified JSON format.

```json
{
  "Gene": "DJ-1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "E163",
        "alt": "K",
        "position": "163"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "E",
        "alt": "K",
        "position": "163"
      },
      "Description in input context": "homozygous missense mutation resulting in the E163K amino acid substitution"
    }
  ],
  "Mutation Description": "associated with early-onset and clinical presentations that include parkinsonism, cognitive decline, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
  "Associated Diseases": ["Parkinson's disease"]
}
```

In this JSON output:

- The extracted information includes the gene name "DJ-1" associated with a specific mutation.
- The cDNA change is described with the reference nucleotide "E163", altered to "K" at position 163, and the transcript not explicitly mentioned ("N.D.").
- The protein change reflects the amino acid substitution from glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K) at position 163.
- The mutation description is extracted directly from the literature snippet.
- The associated diseases are listed as Parkinson's disease.
