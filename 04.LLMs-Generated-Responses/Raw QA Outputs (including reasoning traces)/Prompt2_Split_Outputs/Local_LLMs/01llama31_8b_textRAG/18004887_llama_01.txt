Based on the provided text, I will extract information related to mutations and return it in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
  "Gene": "parkin",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "K48A"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "K",
        "alt": "A",
        "position": "48"
      },
      "Description in input context": "point mutations in the E3 ligase parkin are one of the most commonly observed traits."
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "R42P"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "R",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "42"
      },
      "Description in input context": "the single point mutation R42P in parkin’s Ubld caused poor expression and degradation of the protein."
    }
  ]
}
```

The extracted information includes two mutations: K48A and R42P, both affecting the parkin gene. The cDNA change for each mutation is represented by a string indicating the position of the mutation (e.g., "K48A"), and the protein change shows the specific amino acid substitution at that position.
