Based on the provided literature excerpt, I have extracted relevant mutation-related information and formatted it according to the specified JSON template.

```json
{
  "Gene": [
    {
      "DJ-1"
    }
  ],
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "L",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "L",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Description in input context": "L166P, M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S"
    }
  ],
  "Protein Changes": [
    {
      "DJ-1 mutant protein changes": "M26I, L166P, R98Q, D149A, C106S"
    }
  ]
}
```

Please note that I have used "N.D." for the transcript position since it was not mentioned in the provided text. Additionally, I extracted multiple mutation variants as per the literature excerpt, and they are listed under a single "variants" array.

The extracted information includes:

* Gene: DJ-1
* Variants:
	+ cDNA Change (L166P): N.D., ref = L, alt = P, position = 166
	+ Protein Change (L166P): ref = L, alt = P, position = 166
	+ Description in input context: L166P, M26I, R98Q, D149A, C106S
* Protein Changes:
	+ DJ-1 mutant protein changes: M26I, L166P, R98Q, D149A, C106S
