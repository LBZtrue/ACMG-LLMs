Based on the provided literature, I was able to identify that it contains information related to mutations. Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "alpha-synuclein",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "30"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "30"
      },
      "Description in input context": "pathogenetic point mutation A30P"
    }
  ]
}
```

The extracted information is related to the alpha-synuclein gene, specifically the mutated form (A30P). The cDNA change refers to the nucleotide change at position 30 from adenine (A) to proline (P), and the protein change also indicates a substitution of alanine (A) with proline (P) at position 30.
