Here is the extracted information related to mutations from the provided medical literature text:

```json
{
  "Gene": [
    {
      "LRRK2"
    },
    {
      "wild-type LRRK2",
      "G2019S variant of LRRK2",
      "Y1699C variant of LRRK2",
      "G2385R variant of LRRK2"
    }
  ],
  "variants": [
    {
      "LRRK2 G2019S",
      "Y1699C",
      "G2385R",
      "wild-type LRRK2"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "late-onset loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons"
    }
  ],
  "Associated Phenotypes": [
    "late-onset loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons",
    "locomotion deficits",
    "reduced lifespan",
    "increased sensitivity to rotenone"
  ]
}
```

Note that I have extracted the mutation information related to LRRK2, including the different variants mentioned in the text. The description of the variant G2019S is associated with late-onset loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and other phenotypes. For content not mentioned, I have supplemented it with "N.D." as per the format requirements.
