Based on the provided literature, I found that it contains information related to mutations.

The extracted mutation-related details are as follows:

```json
{
  "Gene": "a-synuclein",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "single point mutations and gene duplication/triplication that are causally linked to early-onset familial PD"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: Since the literature does not specify any particular mutation (cDNA or protein change) for a-synuclein, I provided "N.D." as a placeholder for missing information. The extracted details only mention the general association of a-synuclein mutations with Parkinson's disease.
