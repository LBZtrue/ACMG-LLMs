Based on the provided text, I can extract information related to mutations as follows:

The literature mentions that Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism is directly linked to mutations in the parkin gene.

Here's the extracted information in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "parkin",
  "variants": [
    {
      "Description in input context": "Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism is directly linked to mutations in this gene."
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: Since specific cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions are not mentioned for the parkin gene, I have supplemented those fields with "N.D." (Not Determined).
