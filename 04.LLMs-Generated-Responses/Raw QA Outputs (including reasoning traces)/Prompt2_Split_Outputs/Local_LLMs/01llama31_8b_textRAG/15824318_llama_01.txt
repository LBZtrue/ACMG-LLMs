Here is the extracted information from the given text:

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "G309D"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G309",
        "alt": "D"
      },
      "Description in input context": "G309D mutation, originally reported to be stable and properly localized in cells"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "L347P"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "L347",
        "alt": "P"
      },
      "Description in input context": "L347P mutation, grossly destabilizes PINK1 and drastically reduces kinase activity"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: The output format is consistent with the provided example. The extracted information includes gene name (PINK1), variants of mutations (G309D and L347P) along with their cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions in the input context.
