Here is the extracted information related to mutations from the provided literature paragraph:

```json
{
  "Gene": "PARK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "mutations of which cause AR–JP (ref. 2)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: Since the text does not explicitly mention specific mutations or their descriptions, I have used "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
