Based on the provided literature, I will extract information related to mutations from the text.

The input text paragraph is:
"Somatic mutations of the Parkinson's disease–associated gene PARK2 in glioblastoma and other human malignancies"

After carefully reading the text, I identified that it contains mutation-related terms. Here are the extracted details:

```json
{
  "Gene": "PARK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "Somatic mutations of the Parkinson's disease–associated gene PARK2"
    }
  ]
}
```

Please note that since the text does not provide specific cDNA or protein changes, I supplemented these fields with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
