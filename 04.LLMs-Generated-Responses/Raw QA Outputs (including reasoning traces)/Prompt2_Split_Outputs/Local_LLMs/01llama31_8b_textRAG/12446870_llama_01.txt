Based on the provided literature excerpt, I do not find any information related to mutations, gene associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism, or DJ-1 mutations.

Therefore, my response will be:

  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",

        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
