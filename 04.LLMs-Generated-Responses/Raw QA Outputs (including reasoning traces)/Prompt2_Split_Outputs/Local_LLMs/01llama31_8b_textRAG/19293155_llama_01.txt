Based on the provided medical literature paragraph, I will extract information related to mutations and present it in the specified JSON format.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
The effects of other PD-associated point mutations are less clear. Here we demonstrate that the M26I mutation reduces DJ-1 expression, particularly in a null background (knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Thus, homozygous M26I mutation causes loss of DJ-1 protein.

**Extracted Information:**
```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "M",
                "alt": "I",
                "position": "26"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "M",
                "alt": "I",
                "position": "26"
            },
            "Description in input context": "M26I mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: I have used "N.D." for transcript information since it was not mentioned in the provided paragraph. The extracted information includes the gene name (DJ-1), cDNA change (M26I), protein change (M26I), and description of the mutation in the input context.
