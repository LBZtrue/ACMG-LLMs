Based on the provided literature, I will extract information related to mutations.

```json
{
  "Gene": "DJ-1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "L",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Description in input context": "Deletion and point (L166P) mutations of DJ-1 have recently been shown to be responsible for the onset of familial PD, PARK7."
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that I've included only the mutation related to DJ-1 as it is explicitly mentioned in the literature. The extracted information includes the gene name, cDNA change (with "N.D." for missing information), protein change, and a description of the mutation from the input context.
