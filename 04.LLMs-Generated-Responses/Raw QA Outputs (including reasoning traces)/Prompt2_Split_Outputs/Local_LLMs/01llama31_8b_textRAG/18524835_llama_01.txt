Based on the provided medical literature text, I will extract relevant details related to mutations.

Here is the extracted information in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "W437X"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "W437X"
      },
      "Description in input context": "homozygous mutation p.W437X in the PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)"
    }
  ],
  "mtDNA mutations": [
    {
      "Gene": "ND5",
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "G",
        "position": "12397"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "T21",
        "alt": "A"
      }
    },
    {
      "Gene": "ND6",
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "T",
        "alt": "C",
        "position": "14319"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N119",
        "alt": "D"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that I have used "N.D." where the literature does not provide specific information about transcript or protein changes. Additionally, I have extracted information related to both nuclear and mtDNA mutations, as mentioned in the text.
