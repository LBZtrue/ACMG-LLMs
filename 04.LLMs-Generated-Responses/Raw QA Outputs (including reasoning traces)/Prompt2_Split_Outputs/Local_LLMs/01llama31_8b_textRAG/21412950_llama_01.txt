Based on the provided medical literature, I have extracted relevant information related to mutations.

```json
{
  "Gene": "PINK1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "mutations in PINK1 were shown to cause recessive familial PD"
    }
  ]
}
```

The extracted information is related to the PINK1 gene, which has been associated with Parkinson disease (PD). The description provided mentions that mutations in PINK1 cause recessive familial PD. However, specific cDNA changes or protein changes are not mentioned in the literature snippet.

Please note that the output might require supplementation with "N.D." for content not explicitly mentioned in the input text.
