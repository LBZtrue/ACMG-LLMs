Based on the provided literature, I will extract the relevant mutation information related to the LRRK2 Gly2385Arg variant and present it in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "Gly2385",
        "alt": "Arg2385",
        "position": "2385"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "Gly",
        "alt": "Arg",
        "position": "2385"
      },
      "Description in input context": "The glycine at position 2385 is a candidate site for N-myristoylation. The Gly2385Arg variant replaces the hydrophobic glycine with the hydrophilic arginine, and increases the net positive charge of the LRRK2 WD40 domain."
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that I have used "N.D." to indicate that the transcript position is not mentioned in the provided text.
