Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a paragraph about mutations in the LRRK2 gene and wants me to extract relevant information. First, I need to check if there are any mutation-related terms.

Looking at the text: "Autosomal dominant mutations in the human Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene represent the most common monogenetic cause for Parkinson disease (PD) accounting for up to 7% of familial PD and for a significant fraction of sporadic PD cases in the European population..." Then there's a list of mutations like G2019S, Ozelius et al. 2006, etc. 

Next, the paragraph mentions "LRRK2 protein is 2527 amino acids in length..." and "the LRRK2 protein is 2527 amino acids in length..." and "in vitro analysis on catalytic properties of LRRK2 showed autokinase activity..." 

So, the key points here are the mutations mentioned: G2019S. The text also references Ozelius et al. 2006, but the user's question is to extract mutation details. The answer should list the gene, the mutation, and any positions. 

Wait, the input text includes "G2019S" and "Ozelius et al. 2006". But the example in the instructions uses "c.248G>A" as a model. Here, the user's text has "G2019S" as a mutation. So I need to extract that. Also, positions are mentioned in the text, like "G2019S", but the example uses "position" as a field. 

So, the answer should be in the specified JSON format, including the gene (LRRK2), mutation (G2019S), position (2019) and the reference (Ozelius et al. 2006). Wait, but in the example, the reference is in the "Description in input context". So the user's text mentions the reference but doesn't specify the position. However, the original text says "G2019S" but doesn't mention positions. Wait, checking again: "G2019S, is responsible for about 40%... in North African Arabs..." but positions aren't explicitly stated. So maybe in the answer, I should note that the mutation is present but positions are not provided. But in the example, they have positions. So the user's text doesn't provide positions, so maybe leave them as N.D.?

Wait, the user's question is to extract information from the paragraph. The paragraph mentions the mutation but doesn't specify positions. So the answer should be that the mutation is present but positions are not mentioned. Therefore, in the JSON, the positions are N.D.?

Wait, but the example uses "position": "248" and "ref": "G". So maybe the user's text here doesn't have positions, so they should be N.D.?

But looking at the original text again: "G2019S, is responsible for about 40%... (Lesage et al. 2006;Ozelius et al. 2006)" – but the positions aren't specified here. So the answer would be that the mutation is present with the gene name and the mutation, but positions are not provided. Therefore, in the JSON, the positions are N.D.?

Yes, that makes sense. So the final answer is to extract the gene (LRRK2), the mutation (G2019S), and the reference. Since positions aren't mentioned, mark them as N.D.?
