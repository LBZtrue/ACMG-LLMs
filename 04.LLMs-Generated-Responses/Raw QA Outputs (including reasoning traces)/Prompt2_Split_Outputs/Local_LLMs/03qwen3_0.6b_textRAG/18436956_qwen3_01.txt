Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about mutations in the DJ-1 protein linked to Parkinson's disease. They want me to extract mutation information based on the text.

First, I need to check for any mention of mutations. The paragraph starts by talking about mutations in DJ-1 and their association with Parkinson's. Then it lists the mutations: L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A. It compares these with the wild-type protein, noting that L166P is severe and global. The rest are less perturbed, and they mention thermodynamic stability issues. Also, it mentions that these mutants cause functional differences leading to pathogenicity.

Now, I need to extract the specific details. The user specified to extract gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation positions. Looking at the input, the DJ-1 protein is mentioned, so the gene is "DJ-1". The mutations are listed, so their cDNA changes and positions are present. For example, L166P is in position 166, and E64D is in position 64. The rest have similar positions. The wild-type is referenced, so the wild-type protein is mentioned. 

I should check if there's any other information not mentioned. The rest of the paragraph talks about the structure and thermodynamic differences, which are part of the mutations' impact. Since all the mutation details are in the text, and the user wants to extract them, I can structure the JSON accordingly. Make sure to use "N.D." for anything not mentioned. The example given in the instructions uses similar structure, so follow that format.
