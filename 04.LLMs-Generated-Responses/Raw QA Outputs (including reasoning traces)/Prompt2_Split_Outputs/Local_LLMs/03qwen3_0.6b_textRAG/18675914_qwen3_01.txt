Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about mutations in LRRK2 and wants me to extract information related to mutations. First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations. 

Looking at the abstract, there's a mention of Y1699C and G2019S mutants. Also, there's a reference to wild-type LRRK2 but not those mutants. The HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells' response to oxidative stress is mentioned, which is linked to the presence of the kinase domain. 

In the introduction, they talk about mutations linked to parkinsonian symptoms, but the main focus is on the effect of these mutations. The key points are Y1699C and G2019S mutants. So, the mutations are Y1699C and G2019S. 

I need to extract the gene, the mutations, and their descriptions. The gene is LRRK2. The mutations are Y1699C and G2019S. The positions are specified. So, structuring the JSON with those details. 

Check if there's any other mutation mentioned. The paragraph doesn't mention other mutations like R1441C. So, the answer should include those two mutations with their positions. Make sure to use N.D. for any missing information.
