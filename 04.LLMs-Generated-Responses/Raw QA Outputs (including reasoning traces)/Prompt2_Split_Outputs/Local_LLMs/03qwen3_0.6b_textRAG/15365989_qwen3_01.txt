Okay, let's start by looking at the user's question and the provided text. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the medical literature. The answer needs to be in JSON format if mutations are present, or "N.D." otherwise.

First, I need to scan through the text for any mentions of mutations. The abstract mentions mutations in the parkin gene and other genes like DJ1. Then, in the patients, there's a third mutation c.192G4C (p.E64D) associated with EOPD. Also, the article talks about the L166P mutation in the DJ1 gene. 

I should check if these mutations are mentioned. The PARK7 mutation is part of the EOPD, and the c.192G4C is a third mutation. The L166P is from the DJ1 gene. So, all three mutations are present. Now, I need to format this into the specified JSON. Each mutation entry should have gene name, cDNA change, protein change, and description. All the relevant details are there, so I can structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "192"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "64"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.192G4C (p.E64D)"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "L",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "166"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "L",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "166"
            },
            "Description in input context": "L166P mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```
