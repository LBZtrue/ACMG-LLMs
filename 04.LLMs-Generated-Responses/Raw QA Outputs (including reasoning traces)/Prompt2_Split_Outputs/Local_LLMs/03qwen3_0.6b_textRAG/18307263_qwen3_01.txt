Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about compound heterozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene and wants me to extract information related to mutations. First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations.

Looking at the paragraph, it says "Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene represent the second most frequent cause of autosomal recessive parkinsonism..." So there's a mention of compound heterozygous mutations. Then, in the same paragraph, it mentions "p.A244G and p.V317I" as mutations that abolish wild-type PINK1's protective effect. Also, "p.A244G and p.V317I" are both found in the same patient. The other parts talk about the patient's age, progression, and response to levodopa. 

So the key mutations are the ones with p.A244G and p.V317I. I need to extract those. The position numbers are 244G and 317I. The protein changes are ref and alt. The input context mentions the mutations, so I can extract that. The rest of the information is about the patient's case, which is part of the study. Since the user asked specifically for mutations, I should focus on those. 

Wait, the user's example had the gene name, variants with cDNA changes, and protein changes. In this case, the gene is PINK1. The mutations are specified as p.A244G and p.V317I. The positions are 244 and 317. The protein changes are ref and alt. So I should structure the JSON with those details. No other parts are relevant. The answer should be in the specified format with N.D. for anything not mentioned.
