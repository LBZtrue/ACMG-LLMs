Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about mutations in the αS gene causing autosomal dominant Lewy body diseases. The task is to extract mutation information if it's present.

First, I need to check if the paragraph mentions any mutations. The paragraph talks about mutations like E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T. It also mentions that these mutations accelerate fibril formation, but their exact effects at early stages are unknown. Then there's the aggregation process, monomer dynamics, and oligomerization. The results show that mutations have opposite effects on early stages.

So, the relevant mutations are E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T. Each has a position in the gene. For example, E46K is in position 46, A30P in position 30, A53T in position 53, and A30P/A53T in both. The wild type is WT, so those mutations are compared to WT.

I need to structure this in the JSON format as specified. Each mutation entry should have the gene name, variants, and position. The "Description in input context" field should indicate that these mutations are from the context. So the answer should list all the mutations with their positions and the note that they are from the text.
