Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about mutations in Parkinson's disease related to DJ-1. First, I need to check if there are any mentions of mutations. Let me read through the text again.

The paragraph starts by talking about mutations in PD causing loss of DJ-1. It mentions M26I mutation reducing DJ-1 expression, especially in knockouts. Then there's C106A mutation abolishing ASK1 binding. It also talks about peripheral cysteine mutants retaining cytoprotection and PD-associated mutants [M26I]DJ-1 not suppressing ASK1. 

Wait, the user's question is whether the input text contains mutation information. The paragraph does mention specific mutations like M26I, C106A, and peripheral cysteine residues. So I need to extract those. Also, check for gene names. The input mentions DJ-1, so the gene is DJ-1. 

Now, the example given in the instructions shows how to extract. For each mutation, I need to note the gene, variants, protein changes, and position. The M26I mutation is a protein change with the position 26 and the gene is DJ-1. The C106A mutation is a protein change with position 106. The peripheral cysteine mutants are also mentioned, but they are not in the input context. Wait, the user's input does mention peripheral cysteine mutants retaining cytoprotection, but in the example, they are not provided. So I should note that. 

So, the answer should list the mutations, their positions, and specify that peripheral cysteine mutants are mentioned. But in the example, they are not provided, so I can't use that. Therefore, the extracted information would include the specific mutations found in the paragraph. 

Wait, the user's answer example uses the input text. So in this case, the input text does mention the mutations. Therefore, the correct extraction would be the specific mutations mentioned, along with their positions and gene. The rest is N.D. for other information.
