Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about LRRK2 mutations and their impact on Parkinson's disease. The question is whether the text contains mutation information and, if yes, to extract relevant details.

First, I need to check for any mentions of mutations. The paragraph talks about mutations in the LRRK2 gene. Let me scan through. The first sentence mentions "Gain-of-function mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)", so that's a mutation. Then, there's "pathogenic LRRK2 antagonizes these miRNAs", which indicates the presence of mutations. Also, in the examples, when we had a mutation like c.248G>A, it was extracted as part of the gene. So, in this case, the key mutations are in LRRK2, and the positions 248 and 83 are noted. The other parts about miRNAs and dLRRK and hLRRK2 are part of the context, but not mutations. So the answer should be to extract LRRK2 mutations with their positions, and note that in the JSON format as specified.
