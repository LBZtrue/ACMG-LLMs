Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about mutations in LRRK2 and wants me to extract relevant information. First, I need to check if there's any mention of mutations. The context mentions mutations in LRRK2, specifically I2020T and G2019S. The user also mentioned that the mutations affect kinase activity and are associated with PD. So, I need to extract the gene names, the mutations themselves, and their effects.

Looking at the text, the main points are that these mutations are in the LRRK2 gene. The mutations are I2020T and G2019S. The ATP affinity changes are mentioned, so I should note that. Also, the in vitro kinase activity assays show resistance or sensitivity to inhibitors. But the user's question is about the mutations, so the focus should be on the gene names and the mutations. The rest of the content is about the effects of these mutations, which are part of the study, but not directly about mutations themselves. So the answer should list the gene names, the specific mutations, and their impact. Make sure to use the JSON format as specified and avoid any non-mutation content.
