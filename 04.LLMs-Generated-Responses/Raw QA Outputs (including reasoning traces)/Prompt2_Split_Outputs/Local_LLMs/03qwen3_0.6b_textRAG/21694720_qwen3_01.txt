Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a medical literature paragraph and wants to extract information about mutations. First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations.

Looking at the paragraph: "Parkin is an E3-ubiquitin ligase... autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism... mutations in the parkin gene." Then there's a part about Parkin mutations disrupting autoubiquitination. Wait, the original text mentions "Parkin mutations disrupt this autoinhibition, resulting in a constitutively active molecule." Also, "the mechanism of autoregulation involves ubiquitin binding by a C-terminal region of Parkin." 

So, mutations in the parkin gene are directly linked. The cDNA change would be the parkin gene. The position of the mutation is mentioned as "parkin gene" but in the input, the user's example uses "TP53 gene." Wait, in the example given, the user's answer included gene names and positions. But in the input provided, the user's own text says "parkin gene." However, looking at the example provided by the user, they used "TP53 gene." Wait, but the user's input here is their own text, which includes "parkin gene" in the context of the disease. So in the answer, I need to extract the gene name as "parkin," and check if there are specific mutations. The paragraph mentions "mutations in the parkin gene," so that's a direct mention. The cDNA change would be the parkin gene. The positions are not specified here, so they can be N.D. The other parts about the mechanism are about Parkin's role, not mutations. So the answer should be structured with the gene name as "parkin" and the positions as N.D. for the mentioned mutations.
