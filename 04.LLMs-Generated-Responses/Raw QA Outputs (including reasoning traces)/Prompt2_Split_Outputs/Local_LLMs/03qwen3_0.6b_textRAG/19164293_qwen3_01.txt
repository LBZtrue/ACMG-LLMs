Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. First, I need to check if there are any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, there are a few points. The first sentence talks about a mutation in a study of lung cancer patients. Then, there's mention of three missense mutations (A53T, A30P, E46K) and their cDNA changes, along with their association with PD. Also, there's information about the gene being ␣-synuclein, which is a key part here. 

Wait, the user's example uses TP53 gene with a mutation. In the input paragraph, the first part mentions a mutation in the TP53 gene, and then the other mutations are also in the ␣-synuclein gene. So, I need to extract those details. 

The user's answer format requires specific fields like Gene, variants, etc. For each variant, I should note the cDNA change, protein change, and the mutation description. Since the input text mentions specific mutations in the ␣-synuclein gene, those should be extracted. The other parts about the gene are part of the context but not mutations. So, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure to include all relevant mutations and not add anything else.

```json
{
  "Gene": "␣-synuclein",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A",
        "position": "248"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "D",
        "position": "83"
      },
      "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
    }
  ]
}
