Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about Parkinson's disease and mutations, specifically in the PARK2 gene. They want me to check if there's any mutation information and extract relevant details.

First, I need to look through the paragraph for any mentions of mutations. The user's context mentions mutations in the PARK2 gene, so I should check that. The paragraph says "mutations in PARK2" but doesn't specify the exact mutations. It refers to a mutation as "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", which is a specific example. So I can extract the gene name as PARK2, the mutation type, and the positions. The other parts about Parkin and its role don't mention mutations. So the answer should be in the specified JSON format with the relevant details.

```json
{
    "Gene": "PARK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```
