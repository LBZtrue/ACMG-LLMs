Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided a medical literature paragraph and wants me to extract information related to mutations. First, I need to check if the paragraph mentions any mutations.

Looking at the abstract, it says "PARK2 mutations of which cause AR-JP (ref. 2), but the function of the gene product, parkin, remains unknown." So here, they mention mutations in PARK2, but there's no mention of parkin mutations or other mutations. The rest of the text talks about parkin's role in ubiquityl chain formation and mutant parkins causing loss of activity, but that's more about the function of parkin, not mutations themselves.

The user's example includes a gene like TP53 with mutations and protein changes. So, in this case, the paragraph doesn't mention any specific mutations except that PARK2 has a mutation. But wait, the original paragraph says "PARK2 mutations of which cause AR-JP" but doesn't specify the mutation details. So the answer should be N.D. because the information isn't present here. There's no mention of mutations in the text. So I need to return N.D. for all relevant mutations.
