Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about LRRK2 mutations and their interactions with 14-3-3. The question is whether this text contains information related to mutations and, if so, to extract relevant details.

First, I need to check for any mention of mutations. The paragraph starts by stating that LRRK2 is mutated in many Parkinson's patients, but little is known about its regulation. Then it says that 14-3-3 isoforms interact with LRRK2. It also mentions that endogenous LRRK2 in Swiss 3T3 cells and tissues is associated with 14-3-3 isoforms. The results show that phosphorylation of Ser 910 and 935 is disrupted, leading to LRRK2 accumulation in inclusion bodies. Then it talks about specific mutations like R1441C, R1441G, etc., and their effects on 14-3-3 binding. Finally, it mentions that three mutations have elevated kinase activity.

So, the key points here are the mutations in LRRK2 (specific mutations like R1441C, R1441G, etc.) and their impact on 14-3-3 binding and cellular localization. The user's answer should extract these details in the specified JSON format. Since the text does mention mutations and their specific details, the answer should include those, using the provided example structure.
