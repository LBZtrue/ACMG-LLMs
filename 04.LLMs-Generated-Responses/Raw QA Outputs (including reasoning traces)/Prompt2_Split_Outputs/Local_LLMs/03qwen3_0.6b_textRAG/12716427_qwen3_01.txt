Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a paragraph about Parkinson's disease and a-synuclein mutations. First, I need to check if there are any mutation-related terms mentioned.

Looking at the text, there's a-synuclein mentioned, but it's part of the Lewy body formation. The paragraph talks about normal and mutant a-synuclein cells, but the mutations are in the cDNA (G>A) and protein (p.G83D) positions. It also mentions other genes involved in dopamine synthesis, like GTP cyclohydrolase, sepiapterin reductase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and aromatic acid decarboxylase. Then there's the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1. 

Wait, the user's question is about extracting mutation details from the text. The input paragraph does mention specific mutations: c.248G>A and p.G83D. The other genes are mentioned in the context of their roles in dopamine synthesis, not mutations themselves. So the answer should list those mutations with their positions. The rest of the text doesn't mention mutations except those two. So the JSON should include those details as per the examples given.
