Okay, let's see. The user provided a medical literature paragraph and wants me to extract mutation-related information. First, I need to check if there are any mutations mentioned.

Looking at the paragraph, there's a mention of "α-syn" and "mutation site 46". The text says "mutation site 46 linked to a familial form of PD (E46K)". So here, they're talking about a mutation in α-syn, specifically at position 46. Then, there's a part about "synthetic GBD peptides" and their interactions with GM3. But I don't see any mutations in the GBD peptides or in the GM3 structure. 

Wait, the user's question is about mutations, so I need to check if there are any mutations in the protein. The E46K mutation is mentioned, so that's a mutation. The other parts about the GBD peptides don't mention mutations. The answer should be based on what's directly stated. Since the user's example included gene names and specific mutations, I need to follow that format. 

So, the extracted information would be the gene name (α-syn) and the mutation details (E46K). No other mutations are present, so the JSON should just list those. I need to make sure I'm not adding anything else and use "N.D." where necessary. Let me double-check the instructions again to confirm.

```json
{
  "Gene": "α-syn",
  "variants": [
    {
      "transcript": "N.D.",
      "ref": "G",
      "alt": "D",
      "position": "46"
    }
  ]
}
```
