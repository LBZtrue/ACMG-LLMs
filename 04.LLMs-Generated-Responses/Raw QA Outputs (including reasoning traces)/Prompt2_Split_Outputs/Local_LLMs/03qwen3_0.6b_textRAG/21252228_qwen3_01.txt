Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a paragraph about Parkinson's disease and mutations. The main points are about α-synuclein accumulation and autophagy. The question is whether the text contains mutation information.

Looking at the paragraph, there's mention of mutations in various genes. For example, in the first sentence, they talk about the c.248G>A mutation in the TP53 gene. Then later, they mention other genes like SNCA, Parkinson's protein, and mitochondria. Also, there's a part about the products of PD-related genes showing localization, which suggests some mutations are involved. However, the text doesn't specifically mention mutations in the context of the PD mutations themselves. It talks about mutations in genes that are part of the disorder, but not the mutations themselves. So, the answer should be N.D. because the information about mutations is present in the context but not in the specific details provided.
