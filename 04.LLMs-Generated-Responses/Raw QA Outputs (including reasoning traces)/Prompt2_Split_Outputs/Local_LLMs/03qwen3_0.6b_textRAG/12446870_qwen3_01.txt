Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract information related to mutations from the provided medical literature paragraph. First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations.

Looking at the paragraph, the main content is about DNA repair in D. radiodurans exposed to high Mn²+ concentrations. There's a mention of "DNA toroids" and "repair model," but nothing about mutations. The user's example includes gene names and mutations like TP53. But in this paragraph, there's no mention of specific mutations or gene changes. The original text talks about the organism's DNA structure and repair mechanisms, not mutations. So the answer should be N.D. because there's no mutation information here.

```json
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [],
  "Protein Change": {
    "ref": "N.D.",
    "alt": "N.D."
  }
}
