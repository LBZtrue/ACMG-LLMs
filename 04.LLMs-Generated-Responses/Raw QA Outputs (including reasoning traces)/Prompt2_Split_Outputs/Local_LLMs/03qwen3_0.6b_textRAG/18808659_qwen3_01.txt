Okay, let me start by looking at the user's query and the provided context. They want me to extract mutation information from the medical literature paragraph. The user is a professional in medical literature data mining, so I need to check for any mentions of mutations.

The context mentions three missense mutations in the α-syn gene: A30P, A53T, and E46K. These are all specific mutations. Also, there's a note about PD-linked mutations and their effects on α-syn. The study shows that brain cytosol factors like lipids and ATP modulate α-syn binding. The mention of protease-sensitive factors in brain cytosol also indicates that there are other factors involved. 

Wait, the user's question is about whether the text contains mutation information. Let me check again. The paragraph does mention mutations in the α-syn gene and some associated mutations. So the key points are the three mutations. I need to extract those details into the JSON format as specified. The user's example shows similar structure, so I'll follow that model. Make sure not to add anything else and use "N.D." for non-mutation info.
