Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract information about mutations from a medical literature paragraph. The first thing I need to do is read the paragraph and check for any mention of mutations.

Looking at the text, there's a lot of information about the human DJ-1 gene, its location on chromosome 1p36.2-p36.3, and some mutations. Let me scan through it again. The paragraph mentions mutations in the DJ-1 gene, like M26I, R98Q, D149A, L166P, and C106S. Also, it talks about protease activity mutants, but in the context of the cell lines, they mention these mutants not scavenging reactive oxygen species. Wait, but the problem is to extract mutations, not just the cell lines. Also, the user's example includes gene names, so I need to check if there are any mentions of specific mutations.

In the paragraph, they mention "mutants of DJ-1 found in Parkinson's disease patients" and list various mutations. Then they talk about their stabilities, which are recovered with proteasome inhibitor. Also, the cell lines' results show that mutants don't scavenge reactive oxygen species. However, none of these mutations are described as specific mutations in the context of the patients' disease. The mutations themselves are listed as M26I, R98Q, etc., which are mutations in the DJ-1 gene. So, the answer should list these mutations with their positions. Let me make sure I didn't miss any. The user's example also includes gene names, so I need to check if there are other instances. The DJ-1 gene is mapped on chromosome 1p36.2-p36.3, and there are some mutations there. So, the answer should state that the mutations are M26I, R98Q, D149A, L166P, and C106S, along with their positions. No other mutations are mentioned, so the response is to list those with their positions and confirm they are mutations.
