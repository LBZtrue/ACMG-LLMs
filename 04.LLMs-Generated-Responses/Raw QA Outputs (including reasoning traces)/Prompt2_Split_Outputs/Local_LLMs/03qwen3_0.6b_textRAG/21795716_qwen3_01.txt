Okay, let me start by reading the user's query and the provided context. The user wants me to extract information related to mutations from the given medical literature paragraph. They mentioned that if there's mutation info, extract specific details; else return N.D. 

First, I need to check the text for any mention of mutations. The context talks about Parkinson disease (PD), iron homeostasis, DMT1, and autophagy. There's a part about SH-SY5Y cells expressing DMT1, iron uptake, and increased oxidative stress. No mutation terms here. The examples given in the instructions show that if mutations are present, they should be extracted. Since the input text doesn't mention any mutations, I should return N.D. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The text mentions DMT1 overexpression, but that's about iron uptake. No gene mutations or protein changes. The user's example uses TP53 with cDNA and protein changes. Since there's no mutation in the input, the answer should be N.D.
