Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about a-synuclein and its interactions with phospholipase D (PLD2). The question is whether this text contains mutation information and if so, to extract relevant details.

First, I need to check for any mention of mutations. The paragraph talks about the protein's role in inhibiting PLD2, the effects of different isoforms, and their inhibition levels. There's no explicit mention of specific gene mutations or changes in the a-synuclein protein. For example, it mentions the a, b, and g-synuclein isoforms, but not their mutations. The deletion of specific residues in exons 4 and 6 is mentioned, but those are part of the protein structure rather than mutations. Phosphorylation sites are mentioned, but that's not a mutation. 

So, the answer should be "N.D." because there's no direct mention of mutations in the text. The user might be looking for information about mutations in the a-synuclein protein, but the provided text doesn't specify any such details. Therefore, I need to return N.D. as the appropriate response.
