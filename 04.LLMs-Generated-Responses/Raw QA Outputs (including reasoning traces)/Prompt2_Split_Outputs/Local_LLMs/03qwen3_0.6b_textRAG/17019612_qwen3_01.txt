Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph and wants me to extract information related to mutations, specifically mutations in the LRRK2 gene. First, I need to check if the text mentions mutations at all.

Looking at the paragraph, there's a mention of "Gly2385Arg variant". Also, in the study, they talk about the wild type and Gly2385Arg LRRK2 protein. Then there's a part about the glycine at position 2385 being a candidate site for N-myristoylation. So, the mutations are in LRRK2, specifically at position 2385. 

Wait, the user's question is about mutations, so I need to extract the gene name and the specific mutation. The original text does mention LRRK2, and the variants are Gly2385Arg. Also, the position is 2385. So the answer should include Gene: LRRK2, variants: Gly2385Arg, and position 2385. No other mutations are mentioned, so the rest should be N.D. 

Let me double-check. The paragraph is about a study in Singapore and Taiwan, looking at mutations in LRRK2. The key points are the Gly2385Arg variant and its position. Yep, that's all. So the JSON should have those details.
