Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature paragraph and wants me to extract information related to mutations. First, I need to check if there's any mention of mutations.

Looking at the paragraph: It talks about mutations in the PINK1 gene, specifically G309D and L347P. It mentions that these mutations affect kinase activity and localization in mammalian cells. Also, they describe artificial kinase-dead mutants and their effects. The context includes that these mutations are linked to recessive parkinsonism, which is Parkinson's disease. 

Now, I need to extract the relevant details. The gene is PINK1. The mutations are G309D and L347P. The cDNA changes are as specified, and the protein changes are G309D and L347P. The localization and activity are mentioned, so those details should be included. 

I should format this into the JSON structure as per the example given. Make sure each key is correctly placed and the values are accurate. No other information is mentioned, so "N.D." should be added where necessary. Let me double-check that I didn't miss any details and that the output is in the correct JSON format.

    "Description in input context": "Several mutations in PINK1 gene have been associated with recessive parkinsonism. Mutations in PINK1 are a common cause of parkinsonism with onset before 50, and L347P mutation in PINK1 is present at high frequency in the Philippines."
