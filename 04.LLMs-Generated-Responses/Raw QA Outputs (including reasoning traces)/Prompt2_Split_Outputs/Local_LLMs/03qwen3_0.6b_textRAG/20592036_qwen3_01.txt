Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about ␣-synuclein and its mutations. First, I need to check if there are any mutations mentioned.

Looking through the text, there's a mention of three ␣S point mutations leading to early-onset Parkinsonism. Then, the normal function of ␣S is linked to its ability to bind to vesicles. The study used pulsed ESR measurements to show that all three mutants can transition between broken and extended helices. Also, the ratio of protein to detergent determines the conformation.

Now, the user's question is to extract information related to mutations. The original text does mention three mutations. The answer should extract those. The example given in the instructions shows that if mutations are present, they should be listed with their positions. In this case, the mutations are c.248G>A and p.G83D. The positions are 248 and 83, which are specific to the protein. So I need to structure the JSON with Gene as ␣-synuclein, variants as the two mutations, and their positions. The rest of the information about the conformation and ratio is about the protein's properties, not mutations. So the answer should be structured correctly, using the example's format.

```json
{
    "Gene": "␣-synuclein",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
