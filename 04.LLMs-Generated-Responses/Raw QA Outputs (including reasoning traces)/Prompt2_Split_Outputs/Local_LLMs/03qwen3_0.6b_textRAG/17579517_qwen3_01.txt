Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraph. First, I need to read through the text and look for any mentions of mutations.

The paragraph starts by talking about PINK1 mutations causing Parkinson disease. Then it mentions TRAP1, which is a mitochondrial chaperone, as a substrate for PINK1. It also says that PINK1 phosphorylates TRAP1 both in vitro and in vivo. Then it mentions mutations in PINK1 like G309D, L347P, W437X. Also, PD-linked mutations impair TRAP1 phosphorylation. So I need to check if all these are in the text.

Looking at the text, there are several mutations mentioned: G309D, L347P, W437X, and PINK1 itself. The TRAP1 mutations are part of the mitochondrial context. The user's task is to extract these mutations and describe them. So in the JSON, I should list each mutation with their respective positions. Also, note that PINK1 mutations are in the gene, and TRAP1 is a mitochondrial protein. So the answer should include all the mutations mentioned, even if they are in the same context as PINK1 or TRAP1.
