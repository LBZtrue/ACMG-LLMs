<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about mitochondrial respiratory function in patients with early-onset Parkinsonism and a specific mutation in the PINK1 gene. The task is to extract relevant information related to mutations.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of mutations. The paragraph states that the patient's fibroblasts have a homozygous W437X nonsense mutation in the PINK1 gene. So the key points here are the gene name, the mutation type (nonsense), and the position (W437X). The other parts talk about respiratory activity and ROS levels, but those are not mutations. So the answer should extract the PINK1 gene with the mutation and note the position. Since there's no mention of other mutations, I'll put "N.D." for the rest.
