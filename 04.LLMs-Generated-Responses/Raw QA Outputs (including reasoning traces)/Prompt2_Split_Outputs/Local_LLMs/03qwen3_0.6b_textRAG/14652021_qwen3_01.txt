Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph about mutations in the DJ-1 gene and wants me to extract information related to mutations. First, I need to check if there are any mutation-related terms or descriptions.

Looking at the context, the first sentence mentions "Mutations in DJ-1 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism (AR-EOP)." So there's a mutation in the DJ-1 gene. Then, "loss of DJ-1 function was considered to cause the phenotype." But wait, they also talk about siRNA downregulation leading to cell death caused by oxidative stress, ER stress, and proteasome inhibition. Then, over-expression of wild-type DJ-1 rescued hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death, but not the L166P mutant. Also, DJ-1's role in protecting against these stresses contributes to cell death in AR-EOP.

So the key points here are the mutation in DJ-1 and its role in causing AR-EOP. The user wants to know if there are mutation-related details. The paragraph does mention mutations in the DJ-1 gene, so I should extract that. The variants are not specified here, so I'll leave them as N.D. for the cDNA or protein positions. The protein change is also N.D. because it's not mentioned. So the final answer should be in the specified JSON format with Gene as DJ-1 and relevant details as N.D. for other fields.
