Okay, let me start by looking at the user's question and the provided text. The user is asking whether the input text paragraph contains mutation information and, if so, to extract relevant details. 

First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations. The text is about Parkinson disease and mitochondrial dysfunction. The user provided a paragraph that seems to discuss mutations related to PD-related genes, specifically PINK1 and Parkin. 

Looking at the paragraph, there are mentions of mutations in genes like PINK1 and Parkin. For example, it says "two PD-associated genes, PINK1 and Parkin, have been implicated in the emerging pathway of selective autophagy..." and "piNK1 mutations..." and "pD-linked piNK1 mutations..." and "mutations in both are implicated in cellular dysfunctions..." 

The user's example shows that when mutations are mentioned, they extract gene names, positions, and descriptions. In this case, the text does mention PINK1 and Parkin as mutations. The positions are given as c.248G>A and p.G83D. But wait, the original text mentions "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" in the input context, so the extraction should include those. Also, the note says to supplement with N.D. if not mentioned. Since the text does mention these mutations, the answer should include them with the correct fields.
