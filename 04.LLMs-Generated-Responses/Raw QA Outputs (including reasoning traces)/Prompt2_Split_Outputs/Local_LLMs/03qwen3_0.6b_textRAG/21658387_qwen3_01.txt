Okay, let's see. The user provided a medical literature paragraph and asked to extract information about mutations. First, I need to check if there are any mutation-related terms or descriptions.

Looking at the paragraph, the main points are about LRRK2 mutations. The first sentence mentions R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T. These are all mutations in the LRRK2 gene. The context also states that these mutations interact with Akt1 and are associated with neurodegeneration. 

I need to extract specific details. The mutations themselves are already mentioned: R1441C, G2019S, I2020T. Each of these is a single mutation. The positions (1441, 2019, 2020) are also provided. So I should list each mutation with their positions. 

Wait, the user wants to extract only mutation details. The original text doesn't mention any other mutations, so I can't add more. The answer should be in JSON format with Gene, variants, and descriptions. Each variant should have the position. 

Double-checking: the user's example uses similar structure, so I follow that. No other mutations are mentioned, so "N.D." isn't needed. Final answer should be in the specified JSON.
