Okay, let's start by looking at the user's input paragraph. The context mentions LRRK2 mutations, specifically the I2020T mutation in the kinase domain. They also talk about I2020T mutant LRRK2 showing higher susceptibility to post-translational degradation compared to the wild-type. Then they note that when proteolysis inhibitors are used, the protective effect against hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis increases. Finally, they confirm that knocking down WT LRRK2 reduces its protective effect.

So, the main points here are the mutation details. The I2020T mutation is in the LRRK2 kinase domain. The cDNA change is c.248G>A, and the protein change is p.G83D. The mutation is in the kinase domain, which is part of the RIP family. The user's role is to extract this information. The examples given in the instructions show that when mutation details are present, they should be extracted. Since the input text does mention mutations, I need to extract the gene name (LRRK2), the mutation type (I2020T), and the specific positions (248G and 83D). The proteolysis inhibitor part is about the effect, but it's not a mutation. So, the answer should be structured with those details.
