Okay, let's see. The user provided a medical literature paragraph and is asking whether to extract information related to mutations. First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations.

Looking at the abstract, there's a lot of information about mutations in the amino-terminal region of α-synuclein. The key points mentioned are the E46K mutation, A53T mutation, substitution of Glu 46 for Ala, and Glu 83 in the sixth repeat. Also, the results compare the effects of E46K and A53T mutations, which are both mutations. 

I need to extract specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and positions. The TP53 gene is mentioned in the context of the c.248G>A mutation, which is a specific mutation. The protein change is G83D, and the position is 83. The other mutations are E46K and A53T. 

Wait, the first part of the abstract says the protein is α-synuclein, so the gene is likely not mentioned. But the user's question is about extracting information related to mutations, not the protein itself. However, the example given uses TP53 as a gene, so maybe the user is considering mutations in α-synuclein. 

The answer should be in JSON format, so I need to structure it correctly. The user's example shows that if mutations are present, we extract them with the specified fields. Since the text does mention mutations in the context of α-synuclein, the extracted information should include those details. Let me check again to make sure there's no mention of other mutations. The answer should be N.D. if there's no mutation mentioned, but in this case, there are several mutations listed. So the final answer should list all the mutations with their positions and descriptions.
