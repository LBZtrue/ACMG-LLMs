Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. The task is to determine if the provided text has mutation information and extract it in JSON format. If not, return "N.D.".

First, I'll read the input text carefully. The abstract mentions mutations in the LRRK2 gene, specifically the G2019S variant. It also talks about other variants like Y1699C and G2385R. The introduction mentions LRRK2 mutations as the most common genetic cause of parkinsonism. 

So, the main gene here is LRRK2. The variants listed are G2019S, Y1699C, and G2385R. I need to check if there are cDNA changes and protein changes. The example given uses a format like c.248G>A (p.G83D). In the text, the variants are written as G2019S, Y1699C, G2385R. 

Wait, the problem is that the text doesn't provide the cDNA or protein change details in the same way as the example. For instance, G2019S would be a change from G to S at position 2019 in the protein. But the cDNA change isn't explicitly stated here. The input text doesn't mention the transcript name or the exact nucleotide changes. 

So according to the user's instructions, if the information isn't present, I should put "N.D." For the cDNA Change, the transcript isn't specified, so "transcript": "N.D." The ref and alt for cDNA aren't given either. The protein change has the position and the amino acids, but the example includes the position in the protein. Here, the variants are written as G2019S, which would translate to position 2019, ref G, alt S. Similarly for Y1699C (position 1699, Y to C) and G2385R (position 2385, G to R). 

But the user's example shows the cDNA change with transcript, ref, alt, position. Since the text doesn't provide the transcript name (like NM_001128425.3 for LRRK2), I have to put N.D. for transcript. The ref and alt for cDNA are not given, so those would be N.D. as well. However, the protein change is described, so the position and ref/alt can be filled. 

Wait, the user's example has "transcript": "N.D.", "ref": "G", "alt": "A", "position": "248" for cDNA, and "ref": "G", "alt": "D", "position": "83" for protein. So in our case, for the cDNA change, since the text doesn't specify the transcript, we put N.D. for transcript. The ref and alt are not given, so they would be N.D. as well. But the protein change is present. 

But the input text doesn't mention the cDNA changes, only the protein variants. So for each variant, the cDNA Change would have transcript: N.D., ref: N.D., alt: N.D., position: N.D. because the text doesn't specify. However, the protein change's position and amino acids are present. 

Wait, the user's example has the cDNA change as c.248G>A, which is the nucleotide change, and the protein change as p.G83D. In the input text, the variants are written as G2019S, which would correspond to p.G2019S. So the protein change is present, but the cDNA change isn't mentioned. Therefore, for the cDNA Change, all fields are N.D., but the protein change has the position and amino acids. 

So the JSON structure would have the gene as LRRK2, and for each variant, the cDNA Change is N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, position, and the protein change has ref, alt, position. The Description in input context would be the variant name as given in the text. 

I need to make sure that I'm not assuming any information not present. The text doesn't mention the cDNA changes, only the protein variants. So the cDNA Change fields are N.D. The protein changes are extracted from the variant names. 

So the final JSON would have the gene as LRRK2, and for each variant, the cDNA Change is N.D. and the protein change has the position and amino acids. The description is the variant name as in the text.
