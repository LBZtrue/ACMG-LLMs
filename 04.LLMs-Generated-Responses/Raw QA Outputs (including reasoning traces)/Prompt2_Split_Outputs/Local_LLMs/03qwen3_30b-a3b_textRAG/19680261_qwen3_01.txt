Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. The task is to check if the provided text has mutation information and extract it in JSON format. If not, return "N.D." 

First, I'll read through the given context carefully. The abstract mentions DJ-1 and its role in Parkinson's disease. There are specific mutations discussed: D149A and L166P. 

Looking at the abstract, it states that the D149A mutation makes DJ-1 resistant to caspase-6 proteolysis and removes its protective effect. Then there's the L166P mutation which prevents dimerization but doesn't affect proteolysis by caspase-6. 

So, I need to extract these mutations. The gene is DJ-1. For D149A: the cDNA change isn't explicitly given, so transcript would be N.D. The protein change is D to A at position 149. The description is "D149A". 

Next, L166P: similarly, no cDNA info, so transcript N.D. Protein change L to P at 166, description "L166P". 

I should check if there are other mutations mentioned. The introduction talks about parkin, PINK-1, and DJ-1, but no specific mutations there. The rest of the text discusses mechanisms, not other mutations. 

So the variants array should have both mutations. The Gene is DJ-1. All other fields not mentioned get N.D. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "D",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "149"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "D",

            },
            "Description in input context": "D149A"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "L",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "166"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "L",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "166"
            },
            "Description in input context": "L166P"
        }
    ]
}
