Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided abstract. The instructions are clear: if there's mutation info, extract it into JSON; otherwise, return "N.D.".

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. The authors mention a-synuclein and its role in Parkinson's disease. The key part here is the sentence: "the identification of single point mutations and gene duplication/ triplication that are causally linked to early-onset familial PD". 

So, the abstract does mention mutations. The terms here are "single point mutations" and "gene duplication/triplication". However, the user's example shows that they expect specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, etc. Let me check if the abstract provides any of these.

Looking at the text, the exact mutation details aren't specified. It just states that mutations are linked to PD, but there's no specific gene name, cDNA change, or protein change mentioned. The references [5][6][7][8] might point to studies that detail these mutations, but the abstract itself doesn't provide the specifics. 

The user's example includes a specific mutation like "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" in the TP53 gene. In this case, the abstract doesn't have such detailed information. It only mentions the existence of mutations without specifics. So according to the constraints, I need to extract only what's directly mentioned. Since there's no specific gene or mutation details given here, I should note that.

Therefore, the Gene field would be "N.D.", and the variants array would also have "N.D." for the other fields. The Description in input context would capture the mention of "single point mutations and gene duplication/ triplication" as per the abstract.

I need to make sure that the JSON structure is correct, with all fields filled. Since there's no specific mutation data, all fields except the description would be "N.D.".

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "single point mutations and gene duplication/triplication"
        }
    ]
}
```
