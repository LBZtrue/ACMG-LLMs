Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided text. The input is an abstract and introduction from a study on α-synuclein and Parkinson's disease.

First, I need to carefully read through the text to identify any mentions of mutations. The user mentioned that if there's no mutation info, I should return "N.D.".

Looking at the abstract: The first sentence says, "Mutations in the N-terminus of the gene encoding α-synuclein (α-syn) are linked to autosomal dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD)." So here, there's a mention of mutations in the N-terminus of the α-syn gene. But wait, the user's example shows that they need specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, etc. Let me check if the text provides those.

The next part of the abstract mentions "human mutant α-syn" and specifically "A30P α-syn". The introduction also refers to "point mutations within the α-syn gene leading to familial PD". 

So the gene in question is α-synuclein, which is encoded by the SNCA gene. The mutation mentioned is A30P. Now, I need to check if the text provides the cDNA change and protein change. The abstract says "mutant A30P α-syn". The "A30P" refers to a substitution where the amino acid at position 30 (which is alanine, A) is replaced by proline (P). However, the text doesn't explicitly state the cDNA change (like c.248G>A as in the example). The input text here doesn't provide the nucleotide change, only the protein change. 

In the example given, the input had both cDNA and protein changes. Here, the text mentions the protein change (A30P) but not the cDNA change. So for the "cDNA Change" field, I should put "N.D." unless the text specifies it. The text doesn't mention the cDNA change, only the protein change. 

So the Gene is SNCA (since α-synuclein is encoded by SNCA). The variant is A30P. The Description in input context is "A30P α-syn". The cDNA change isn't provided, so that's N.D. The protein change would be position 30, ref A, alt P. 

Wait, the user's example had "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" which translates to cDNA change at position 248 (G to A) and protein change at 83 (G to D). Here, the text says "A30P" which is a protein change. But the cDNA change isn't mentioned. So in the JSON, "cDNA Change" would be N.D., and "Protein Change" would have the ref and alt as A and P, position 30. 

The description in the context is "A30P α-syn". So putting it all together, the JSON should have the gene as SNCA, variants with the protein change details, and cDNA change as N.D. 

I need to make sure I don't assume any cDNA changes that aren't in the text. The user's instructions say to only extract what's directly mentioned. Since the text doesn't specify the cDNA change, that field should be N.D. 

So the final JSON should look like:

{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "30"
      },
      "Description in input context": "A30P α-syn"
    }
  ]
}

Wait, but the user's example had "transcript" as N.D. if not mentioned. So in the cDNA Change, all fields are N.D. except if specified. Since the text doesn't mention the transcript, position, ref, or alt for cDNA, all those fields are N.D. 

Yes, that's correct. So the JSON is structured accordingly.

```json

    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Description in input context": "A30P α-syn"
        }
    ]
}
