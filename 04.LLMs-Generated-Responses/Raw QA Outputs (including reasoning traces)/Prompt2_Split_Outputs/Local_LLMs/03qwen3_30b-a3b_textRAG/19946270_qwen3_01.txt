Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided text. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format, and if there's no info, return "N.D.".

First, I'll read through the given abstract and main text carefully. The main focus is on the PARK2 gene and its mutations. Let me scan for any mentions of mutations, variants, or specific changes.

In the abstract, it says "Mutation of the gene PARK2... is the most common cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease." Then later, "inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic deletions of PARK2 in human malignancies." Also, "PARK2 mutations in cancer occur in the same domains, and sometimes at the same residues, as the germline mutations causing familial Parkinson's disease." There's a mention of "cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects..." and "PARK2 mutations in cancer decrease PARK2's E3 ligase activity..."

But wait, the user's example includes specific cDNA and protein changes like "c.248G>A (p.G83D)". However, in the provided text, I don't see any specific nucleotide positions or amino acid changes. The text mentions mutations in general, but not specific variants. For example, it says "germline mutations in the PARK2 gene" and "somatic mutations" but no exact cDNA or protein changes. 

Looking at the "Main Parkinson's disease" section, it talks about "germline mutations in the PARK2 gene" and "PARK2 mutations in cancer," but again, no specific variant details. The terms like "inactivating somatic mutations" and "intragenic deletions" are mentioned, but these are general descriptions, not specific mutations.

So, the key here is whether the text provides specific mutation details. Since there's no mention of particular cDNA changes (like c.248G>A) or protein changes (p.G83D), the answer would be that there's no specific mutation information provided. The text discusses mutations in general terms but doesn't list specific variants. 

Therefore, according to the constraints, if the information isn't present, I should use "N.D." for the missing fields. The gene is PARK2, but the variants section would have "N.D." because there are no specific mutations detailed. The Description in input context would also be "N.D." since there's no specific mutation mentioned beyond general terms.

So the final JSON should have the gene as PARK2, and all variant details as N.D.
