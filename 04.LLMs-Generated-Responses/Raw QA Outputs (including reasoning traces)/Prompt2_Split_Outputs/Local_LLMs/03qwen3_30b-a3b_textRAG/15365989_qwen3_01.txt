Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided text. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format, and if there's no info, return "N.D.".

First, I'll read through the given context carefully. The abstract mentions mutations in the parkin gene and DJ1 gene. The key part here is the identification of a third mutation, c.192G>C (p.E64D), in the DJ1 gene. There's also a mention of the L166P mutation in the context of nuclear localization.

I need to check if the text has other mutations. The introduction talks about genetic factors but doesn't mention specific mutations. The main mutation details are in the abstract. The cDNA change is c.192G>C, which corresponds to p.E64D. The position in cDNA is 192, with G to C. The protein change is E64D. The text also mentions the L166P mutation, but that's in the context of another study, not the current one. However, the user's instruction is to extract what's in the input. The input here is the abstract, which does mention the E64D and L166P mutations. Wait, the abstract says "the recently described L166P mutation" but the context here is the current study's mutation, which is E64D. So the current text's main mutation is E64D, and L166P is another mutation mentioned but not part of the current study's findings. But the user's input is the entire text provided, which includes both.

So, the JSON should include both mutations if they are present. Let me check again. The abstract says: "we identified a third mutation, c.192G4C (p.E64D), associated with EOPD... We demonstrate... the E64D mutation... and up to 80% of the cells expressing the recently described L166P mutation displayed a predominant nuclear localization..." So the L166P is mentioned as a previously described mutation. So both mutations are in the text. So the variants should include both.

But wait, the user's example shows that when a mutation is found, extract the details. So here, two mutations: E64D and L166P. Let me parse each.

For E64D: c.192G>C (since the text says c.192G4C, but that might be a typo. Wait, the original text says "c.192G4C (p.E64D)". But that's odd. Normally, cDNA changes are like c.192G>C. Maybe the user's text has a typo, perhaps it's c.192G>C. But the input text says "c.192G4C". Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check the original text again.

Looking back: "we identified a third mutation, c.192G4C (p.E64D), associated with EOPD in a patient of Turkish ancestry..." So the cDNA change is c.192G4C. But that's not standard notation. Typically, it's c.192G>C. Maybe the '4' is a typo for '>'. Alternatively, maybe it's a different notation. But since the user's input has that, I need to take it as is. However, in the example given, the cDNA change is written as "c.248G>A". So perhaps the user's text has a typo here. But as per the instructions, I should extract exactly what's in the text. So c.192G4C. However, that might not be standard. But the user's example has "c.248G>A", so maybe the '4' is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's a different way of representing the change. But since the user's text says "c.192G4C", I have to take that as the input. However, in the example, the cDNA change is written as "c.248G>A", so maybe the user's text has a typo. But I have to follow the exact input. So the cDNA change is c.192G4C. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe it's a formatting error where the '4' is meant to be a '>' or '>'. But I can't assume that. So I'll extract it as is.

Then, the protein change is p.E64D. The position is 64, with E to D. Then, the other mutation is L166P. The text says "the recently described L166P mutation". So that's another variant. For that, the cDNA change isn't specified here. The text doesn't mention the cDNA change for L166P, only the protein change. So for that variant, the cDNA Change would be N.D., but the protein change is L166P. However, the user's example shows that if the cDNA change isn't mentioned, it's set to "N.D.".

So the JSON structure would have two variants: one for E64D with cDNA and protein changes, and another for L166P with only protein change.

But wait, the user's example only includes the cDNA and protein changes when they are present. So in the case of L166P, since the text doesn't mention the cDNA change, we put "N.D." for the cDNA part. However, the text does mention the protein change as L166P. So the variants array would have two entries: one for E64D and one for L166P.

But let me check again. The input text says: "the recently described L166P mutation displayed a predominant nuclear localization". So the L166P is a mutation in DJ1, but the cDNA change isn't specified here. Therefore, in the JSON, for the L166P variant, the cDNA Change would be N.D., and the Protein Change would be L166P.

So the final JSON would have:

Gene: DJ1 (since both mutations are in DJ1)

Variants: two entries.

First variant: c.192G4C (p.E64D)

Second variant: cDNA Change N.D., Protein Change L166P.

But wait, the user's example has the cDNA Change with transcript, ref, alt, position. In the example, the transcript is N.D. because it's not mentioned. In the current case, the cDNA change is given as c.192G4C, so the transcript is N.D. (since the text doesn't specify the transcript), ref is G, alt is C, position is 192. But the original text says "c.192G4C" which might be a typo. However, as per the user's input, that's what's there.

So for the first variant:

cDNA Change: transcript N.D., ref G, alt C, position 192.

Protein Change: ref E, alt D, position 64.

Description in input context: "c.192G4C (p.E64D)".

For the second variant:

cDNA Change: N.D.

Protein Change: ref L, alt P, position 166.

Description in input context: "L166P".

But the user's example has the Description in input context as the exact string from the text. So in the case of L166P, the description would be "L166P".

So putting it all together, the JSON would have:

{
  "Gene": "DJ1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "C",
        "position": "192"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "E",
        "alt": "D",
        "position": "64"
      },
      "Description in input context": "c.192G4C (p.E64D)"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "L",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Description in input context": "L166P"
    }
  ]
}

But wait, in the second variant, the cDNA Change's ref, alt, and position are all N.D. because the text doesn't provide that info. However, the user's example shows that when the cDNA change isn't specified, the fields are set to N.D. So for the second variant, the cDNA Change would have all N.D., but the protein change is L166P.

But the user's example has for the cDNA Change, if the transcript isn't mentioned, it's N.D. So in the case of the second variant, the cDNA change isn't mentioned, so all fields under cDNA Change are N.D.

Therefore, the JSON should be as above. However, I need to check if the text mentions the DJ1 gene for both mutations. Yes, the first mutation is in DJ1, and the L166P is also in DJ1, as per the context. The text says "the recently described L166P mutation" in the context of DJ1's localization. So the gene is DJ1 for both mutations.

So the final answer should be this JSON structure.
