Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. The task is to determine if the provided text has mutation information and extract it in a specific JSON format. If not, return "N.D.".

First, I need to carefully read the input text. The context given is an abstract from a study about DJ-1 mutations linked to Parkinsonism. The user provided an example where mutations like c.248G>A (p.G83D) in TP53 are extracted. 

Looking at the abstract, the key part is: "three different Parkinsonism-associated DJ-1 missense mutations (A104T, E163K, and M26I)". These are the mutations mentioned. The next sentences describe each mutation's effect. For example, "A104T substitution introduces water and a discretely disordered residue..." and "E163K disrupts a key salt bridge with R145", "M26I causes packing defects...".

Now, I need to map these to the JSON structure. The Gene is DJ-1. The variants should include each mutation. The cDNA change and protein change need to be parsed. However, the text doesn't mention transcript names or specific cDNA positions beyond the amino acid changes. For example, A104T would be position 104, ref G (since A is the third letter in the codon?), but wait, the standard notation for cDNA is like c.104G>A for a change from G to A at position 104. However, the text here says "A104T" which is a protein change (A to T at position 104). The cDNA change isn't explicitly stated here. The example given in the user's example had "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", but in the current text, the mutations are listed as A104T, E163K, M26I. 

So, for the cDNA change, the position would be 104, ref A (since the original amino acid is A, which is encoded by GCT, GCG, etc. But without knowing the exact cDNA, maybe it's not possible. The text doesn't provide the cDNA details, only the protein changes. Therefore, the cDNA Change fields might be N.D. unless there's more info. 

The user's example has "transcript": "N.D." when not mentioned. So in this case, the cDNA Change's transcript is N.D. The ref and alt would be the amino acid changes. Wait, but the cDNA change is different from the protein change. For example, if the protein change is A104T, the cDNA change could be GCT to TCT (if the original is A and becomes T). But without knowing the exact codon, it's not possible. The text here doesn't specify the cDNA changes, only the protein changes. So in the JSON, for cDNA Change, the transcript is N.D., and the ref and alt would be the amino acids? But that's not accurate. The user's example had "c.248G>A" which is cDNA, and "p.G83D" which is protein. So in this case, the text mentions "A104T" as the protein change. But the cDNA change isn't given. So for the cDNA Change, we can't fill it in, so it's N.D. But the problem is that the user's example has both cDNA and protein changes. However, in the given text, the mutations are described as "A104T", "E163K", "M26I" which are protein changes. The cDNA changes aren't mentioned. So in the JSON, the cDNA Change would be N.D., and the Protein Change would have the ref and alt as A to T, E to K, M to I, with positions 104, 163, 26 respectively. 

Additionally, the Description in input context would be the exact terms used, like "A104T", "E163K", "M26I". 

So the extracted JSON would have Gene: "DJ-1", and variants with each of these mutations. The cDNA Change's transcript is N.D., and the ref and alt would be the amino acids. Wait, but the cDNA change is different. For example, if the protein change is A104T, the cDNA change could be GCA to ACA (if the original is A, which is GCT, and becomes T, which is ACA). But without knowing the exact codon, we can't specify. Therefore, the cDNA Change fields are N.D. except for the position, but the user's example had "position": "248" for cDNA. However, in the input text, the mutations are given as A104T, which is the protein position. So the position in cDNA would be different. Since the text doesn't provide that, we have to put N.D. 

So the final JSON would be:

{
  "Gene": "DJ-1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "104"
      },
      "Description in input context": "A104T"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "E",
        "alt": "K",
        "position": "163"
      },
      "Description in input context": "E163K"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "M",
        "alt": "I",
        "position": "26"
      },
      "Description in input context": "M26I"
    }
  ]
}

But wait, the user's example had "transcript": "N.D." when not mentioned. So for each variant, the cDNA Change's transcript is N.D., and the ref, alt, position are N.D. because the text doesn't specify the cDNA details. However, the position in the protein change is given. So the JSON structure would have the Protein Change's position as 104, 163, 26, and the cDNA Change's fields as N.D. 

That makes sense. So the answer should be the JSON with those details.
