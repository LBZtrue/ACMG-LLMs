Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. The task is to determine if the provided text has mutation information and extract it accordingly. 

First, I'll read the given abstract carefully. The main subject is alpha-synuclein (αS) and its role in Parkinson's disease. The abstract mentions that αS is linked to Parkinson's through its deposition in Lewy bodies and that there are three αS point mutations causing early-onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism. 

Looking for mutation-related terms: The key sentence here is "three ␣S point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism." The term "point mutations" is a clear indicator. The next part says "the three known PD-linked ␣S mutants." So, the mutations are in the αS gene, which is also known as SNCA.

Now, the user's example shows that if there's a mutation, we need to extract gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. However, in the provided text, the mutations are mentioned as "three ␣S point mutations" but there's no specific cDNA or protein changes listed. The example given in the user's prompt includes details like c.248G>A and p.G83D, but in this case, the abstract doesn't provide specific mutations. It just states that there are three mutations linked to Parkinson's. 

So, the gene is αS, which is SNCA. The variants would be the three point mutations, but since the text doesn't specify their exact positions or changes, those fields should be N.D. The description in the input context is "three ␣S point mutations" but the exact names aren't given. However, the user's example includes the description as the exact mutation notation. Here, the text mentions "three PD-linked ␣S mutants," but without specific details. 

Wait, the user's example had "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" as the description. In our case, the text says "three ␣S point mutations" and "three known PD-linked ␣S mutants." But there's no specific cDNA or protein changes. So, the "Description in input context" would be "three ␣S point mutations" or "three PD-linked ␣S mutants." However, the exact notation isn't provided. 

So, according to the constraints, if the information isn't present, we use N.D. Therefore, the cDNA Change and Protein Change would be N.D. The gene is SNCA (αS). The description would be "three ␣S point mutations" as per the text. 

I need to structure the JSON accordingly. Check if there are any other mentions of mutations. The rest of the text talks about the effects of the mutations on conformations, but no specific mutations are named. So, the answer should have the gene as SNCA, variants with N.D. for cDNA and protein changes, and the description as the text mentions.
