Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. The task is to check if the provided text has mutation information and extract it in JSON format. If not, return "N.D.".

First, I'll read the input text carefully. The abstract mentions "mutations such as E46K, A30P and A53T in the αS gene" causing autosomal dominant LBD. Then in the results, they talk about E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T mutations compared to wild type. 

So the gene here is α-synuclein, which is written as αS in the text. The mutations listed are E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T. The problem is to extract these mutations into the specified JSON structure.

Looking at the example given, the JSON includes Gene, variants with cDNA Change, Protein Change, and Description. However, the input text doesn't mention cDNA changes or specific transcripts. It only lists the protein changes. For example, E46K would be position 46, Glutamic acid (E) to Lysine (K). Similarly, A30P is position 30, Alanine to Proline, and A53T is position 53, Alanine to Threonine. The A30P/A53T is a double mutation.

But the user's example had cDNA and protein changes. However, in the provided text, there's no mention of cDNA changes, only the protein mutations. So for cDNA Change, since the text doesn't specify, I should put "N.D." for transcript, ref, alt, position. But the protein change would have the ref, alt, and position. 

Wait, the user's example had "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" which is cDNA change and protein change. In the input text here, the mutations are given as E46K, etc. So the protein changes are E to K at position 46, A to P at 30, A to T at 53, and A30P/A53T. 

But the problem is that the input text doesn't provide the cDNA details, only the protein changes. So for the cDNA Change, the transcript is N.D., and the ref and alt would be the nucleotide changes, but since the text doesn't mention them, I have to leave them as N.D. However, the protein change would have the amino acid changes. 

But the user's example shows that even if cDNA is not mentioned, the transcript is set to N.D. So I need to follow that. 

So the Gene is "αS" or "SNCA"? The text says "αS gene" which is the same as the α-synuclein gene, which is SNCA. But the text uses "αS gene", so maybe the Gene field should be "αS" as per the text. However, in the example, the gene was "TP53". But the user might expect the standard gene symbol. However, the input text uses "αS gene", so maybe I should use "αS" as the gene name. However, in the literature, the gene is called SNCA. But since the text says "αS gene", I should stick to that. 

But the user's example had "TP53" as the gene. So perhaps in this case, the gene is "SNCA" but the text refers to it as "αS gene". However, the user might want the exact term from the text. The question is whether to use the gene symbol or the protein name. The text says "αS gene", so maybe the Gene field is "αS". But I need to check the example. In the example, the gene was "TP53", which is the gene symbol. So maybe here, the gene is "SNCA", but the text refers to it as "αS gene". However, the user might want the exact term from the text. 

This is a bit ambiguous. But the user's instruction says to extract information directly from the text. The text says "mutations such as E46K, A30P and A53T in the αS gene". So the gene is "αS". Therefore, the Gene field should be "αS". 

Now, for the variants. Each mutation is E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T. Each of these is a variant. 

For each variant, the cDNA Change: the text doesn't mention cDNA changes, so transcript, ref, alt, position are N.D. 

Protein Change: For E46K, the ref is E (Glutamic acid), alt is K (Lysine), position 46. 

Similarly, A30P: ref A (Alanine), alt P (Proline), position 30. 

A53T: ref A (Alanine), alt T (Threonine), position 53. 

A30P/A53T is a double mutation, so maybe two entries? But the user's example had one variant per entry. However, the input text mentions "A30P/A53T" as a mutation. How to handle that? The text says "A30P/A53T mutations" so it's a double mutation. But in the JSON, each variant is an object. So perhaps create two separate entries for A30P and A53T, but also include the A30P/A53T as another variant. However, the user's example only had one variant. 

But the input text mentions "E46K, A30P and A53T and A30P/A53T mutations". So four variants: E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T. 

So each of these would be a separate variant. 

But for the A30P/A53T, how to represent that? The protein change would be two positions. But the JSON structure for Protein Change has ref, alt, position. So perhaps for the double mutation, we need to have two entries? But the user's example had a single variant. 

Alternatively, maybe the description in the input context is "A30P/A53T", and the protein changes would be A30P and A53T. But the JSON structure allows for each variant to have its own Protein Change. 

But the user's example had one variant with one protein change. So perhaps for A30P/A53T, the description is "A30P/A53T", and the protein change would need to be represented as two separate entries? But the JSON structure for variants is an array of objects, each with their own Protein Change. 

But the input text doesn't specify the cDNA changes, so the cDNA Change fields would be N.D. 

So the JSON would have Gene: "αS", and variants array with each mutation. 

So for each mutation:

1. E46K: 
   - cDNA Change: N.D.
   - Protein Change: ref E, alt K, position 46
   - Description: E46K

2. A30P:
   - cDNA Change: N.D.
   - Protein Change: ref A, alt P, position 30
   - Description: A30P

3. A53T:
   - cDNA Change: N.D.
   - Protein Change: ref A, alt T, position 53
   - Description: A53T

4. A30P/A53T:
   - cDNA Change: N.D.
   - Protein Change: ref A (for 30) and A (for 53)? But the description is A30P/A53T. However, the JSON structure for Protein Change has single ref, alt, position. So how to represent a double mutation? Maybe the description would be "A30P/A53T", and the protein change fields would have N.D. since the text doesn't specify. But that's not accurate. 

Alternatively, perhaps the double mutation is considered as two separate variants, but the input text lists them as a single mutation. This is a bit tricky. However, according to the user's example, each variant is a separate entry. So for A30P/A53T, perhaps the description is "A30P/A53T", and the protein change would have N.D. since the text doesn't provide specific details. But that might not be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the text's mention of "A30P/A53T" is a combination, so in the variant, the protein change would have two entries. But the JSON structure doesn't allow for that. So perhaps the best approach is to list each mutation as separate variants, even if they are part of a double mutation. But the input text mentions "A30P/A53T" as a mutation, so it's a separate variant. 

In that case, for the A30P/A53T variant, the protein change would have N.D. since the text doesn't specify the cDNA or protein changes. However, the description would be "A30P/A53T". 

But the user's example had the description as "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", which includes both cDNA and protein changes. In our case, the input text only has the protein changes. So the description would be "E46K", "A30P", "A53T", "A30P/A53T".

Therefore, the JSON would have four variants. Each with their own description, and the cDNA and protein change fields as N.D. except for the protein change's ref, alt, and position. 

Wait, but the user's example had the protein change with ref, alt, position. So in our case, for E46K, the protein change is E (ref) to K (alt) at position 46. Similarly for others. 

So the final JSON would be:

{
    "Gene": "αS",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "E",
                "alt": "K",
                "position": "46"
            },
            "Description in input context": "E46K"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Description in input context": "A30P"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "T",
                "position": "53"
            },
            "Description in input context": "A53T"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "A30P/A53T"
        }
    ]
}

But for the A30P/A53T, since the text doesn't specify the protein changes, the Protein Change fields are N.D. However, the user's example had the protein change as p.G83D. In our case, the description is "A30P/A53T", but the actual protein changes are A30P and A53T. However, the text doesn't mention the cDNA changes, so we can't fill those. So the protein change for the double mutation would have N.D. as well. 

But maybe the user expects that for the double mutation, the protein change is represented as two separate entries. However, the input text lists it as a single mutation. So perhaps it's better to represent it as a single variant with the description "A30P/A53T" and the protein change fields as N.D. 

Thus, the final JSON would include all four variants as above.
