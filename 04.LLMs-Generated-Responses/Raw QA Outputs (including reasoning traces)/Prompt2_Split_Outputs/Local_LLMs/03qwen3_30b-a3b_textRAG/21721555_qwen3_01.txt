Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided text. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format, and if there's no mutation info, I should return "N.D.".

First, I'll read through the given context carefully. The abstract mentions "A53T substitution" and "S87N substitutions". These look like mutations. Let me check the details.

The A53T substitution: Here, the amino acid at position 53 (A) is replaced by Threonine (T). The S87N substitution is at position 87, where Serine (S) is replaced by Asparagine (N). The text also refers to these as part of the chimeras studied. 

Now, I need to map these to the JSON structure. The Gene isn't explicitly mentioned here. The text talks about α-synuclein, which is the protein, but the gene name might be SNCA. However, the input text doesn't specify the gene name, only the protein mutations. So "Gene" would be "N.D." unless the gene is implied. But since the user's example had TP53, maybe here it's SNCA. Wait, the problem says to extract only what's in the text. The text doesn't mention the gene name, just the protein. So Gene should be N.D.

For the variants, each substitution is a separate variant. The first is A53T. The cDNA change would be the nucleotide change leading to this, but the text doesn't provide that. So transcript is N.D. The ref is A (for Alanine), alt is T (Threonine), position 53. The protein change is same as the substitution. Similarly for S87N: ref is S (Serine), alt is N (Asparagine), position 87. The description in the context is "A53T" and "S87N".

Wait, the example had "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" which includes both cDNA and protein changes. Here, the text says "A53T substitution" and "S87N substitutions". So the cDNA change isn't given, only the protein changes. So in the JSON, "cDNA Change" would have transcript as N.D., and the ref and alt as the amino acids, but the position is 53 and 87. However, the user's example used "c.248G>A" which is the cDNA change. Since the text doesn't mention the cDNA changes, only the protein changes, I should leave transcript as N.D. and the ref and alt as the amino acids. 

So the JSON would have two variants: A53T and S87N. Each with their respective positions. The Gene is N.D. because the text doesn't specify the gene name. The description in the context is "A53T" and "S87N".

I need to make sure I'm not adding any information not present. The text doesn't mention the gene name, so Gene is N.D. The cDNA changes aren't provided, so transcript is N.D. The protein changes are the substitutions mentioned. 

So the final JSON should have "Gene": "N.D.", and two entries in variants with the respective details.
