Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, extracting mutation info from the given text. First, I need to carefully read the provided abstract and introduction.

Looking at the abstract, there's mention of mutations in the DJ-1 gene associated with Parkinson's. Specifically, the L166P mutation is noted as destabilizing the protein. Then there's M26I, which is also unstable but less so. The R98Q variant is mentioned as stable. The text also talks about the subcellular localization and oxidative conditions affecting mitochondrial staining.

In the introduction, they mention DJ-1 mutations being recessive and loss of function, but the exact mutations aren't detailed here. The key here is to identify any specific mutations. The abstract has L166P, M26I, and R98Q. For each, I need to check if there's cDNA and protein changes. 

The L166P: The position is 166, with a P (proline) instead of L (leucine). So cDNA change would be c.166L>P, but the text doesn't specify the exact nucleotide change, just the amino acid. The example given uses c.248G>A, but here the input doesn't have the nucleotide details. So maybe "transcript" is N.D. since it's not provided. The protein change is p.L166P. 

Similarly, M26I: position 26, methionine instead of isoleucine? Wait, no. Wait, the mutation is M26I. So the original amino acid is Methionine (M) at position 26, changed to Isoleucine (I). So protein change is p.M26I. Again, no cDNA details. 

R98Q: position 98, glutamine instead of arginine. So p.R98Q. 

The problem is that the input text doesn't provide the cDNA changes (like G>A) but only the protein changes. So in the JSON, the cDNA Change would have "transcript" as N.D. because the text doesn't specify the exact nucleotide change. The protein change would be as given. 

The example given in the user's prompt shows that when the cDNA change isn't specified, "transcript" is set to N.D. So that's the approach here. 

Also, the description in the input context is the exact term used, like "L166P", "M26I", "R98Q". 

So the JSON should have the gene as DJ-1, and each variant with their respective protein changes. The cDNA changes are not provided, so transcript is N.D. 

I need to make sure that all fields are filled. If the text doesn't mention the cDNA change, then it's N.D. The same applies to other fields if not specified. 

So the final JSON would list each mutation with their protein changes and the description as per the text. The gene is DJ-1. The variants array includes each of the three mutations mentioned. The cDNA Change's transcript is N.D. because the text doesn't provide the specific nucleotide changes, only the amino acid changes.
