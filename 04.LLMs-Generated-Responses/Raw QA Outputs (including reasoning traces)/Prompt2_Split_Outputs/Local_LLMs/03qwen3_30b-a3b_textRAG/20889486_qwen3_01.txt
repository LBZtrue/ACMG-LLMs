Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided text. The input here is the abstract and introduction of a study about Parkinson's disease and Parkin mutations.

First, I need to carefully read through the text to spot any mentions of mutations. The user mentioned that if there's no mutation info, I should return "N.D.".

Looking at the abstract: "Parkin RING domain mutant (C289G)" – that's a mutation. The gene is Parkin, and the specific mutation is C289G. Then it talks about Parkin(C289G) aggregation. Also, in the introduction, there's a mention of "Mutations in PARK2, the gene encoding the protein Parkin..." which links PARK2 mutations to Parkinson's. 

So, the gene here is PARK2 (which is the same as Parkin). The mutation mentioned is C289G. The protein change would be from Cysteine to Glycine at position 289. The cDNA change isn't explicitly given here, but the mutation is described as C289G. The protein change is p.C289G. 

Wait, in the example provided, the format has "cDNA Change" with transcript, ref, alt, position. But in the input text, the mutation is written as "C289G". So, the cDNA change would be position 289, ref C, alt G. The protein change would be position 289, ref C, alt G. But the example had "p.G83D" which is different. So here, the protein change is C289G. 

But the input text doesn't mention the transcript, so I should put "N.D." for transcript. The description in the context is "C289G". 

Also, in the introduction, the gene is mentioned as PARK2, which is the same as Parkin. So the Gene field should be PARK2. 

Another point: the text mentions "Parkin(C289G)" which is the same as PARK2. So the variants would include this mutation. 

I need to make sure that all the fields are filled. The example shows that if transcript isn't mentioned, it's N.D. So in this case, the cDNA change's transcript is N.D., ref is C, alt is G, position 289. The protein change's ref is C, alt is G, position 289. The description is "C289G".

Also, check if there are other mutations mentioned. The introduction says "Mutations in PARK2... were linked to autosomal recessive juvenile onset Parkinsonism". But it doesn't specify a particular mutation here, just that mutations in general are linked. So that's a general statement, not a specific mutation. So only the C289G is a specific mutation mentioned.

So the JSON should have Gene as PARK2, variants with the C289G mutation details. Other fields like transcript are N.D. because the text doesn't specify. The protein change is C289G. The description is "C289G".

I think that's all. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.
