Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. The task is to determine if the provided text has mutation information and extract it in JSON format. If not, return "N.D.".

First, I need to carefully read the given abstract. The main focus is on DJ-1 mutations linked to Parkinson's disease. Let me scan through the text for any mentions of mutations.

The abstract starts by mentioning "L166P, a mutant DJ-1 found in Parkinson's disease patients." So that's a mutation. Then it lists other mutants: M26I, R98Q, D149A, and L166P. Also, there's a mention of C106S as a mutant for protease activity. 

Now, I need to extract gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. The gene here is DJ-1. The mutations are L166P, M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S. 

Looking at the format examples, the cDNA change has transcript, ref, alt, position. But in the text, the mutations are given as amino acid changes. For example, L166P: position 166, from Leucine to Proline. Similarly, M26I is Methionine to Isoleucine at position 26. R98Q is Arginine to Glutamine at 98. D149A is Aspartic acid to Alanine at 149. C106S is Cysteine to Serine at 106. 

Wait, the example uses c.248G>A (p.G83D). Here, the text doesn't mention cDNA changes, just the protein changes. So maybe the cDNA change isn't provided, so I should put "N.D." for transcript, ref, alt, position in cDNA Change, but the protein change would have the ref, alt, position. 

But the user's example shows that if the cDNA change isn't specified, we use N.D. So for each variant, the cDNA Change would be N.D. since the text only gives the protein changes. The Description in input context would be the mutation names like L166P, etc.

So the JSON structure should have Gene as "DJ-1", and each variant with Protein Change details. The cDNA Change would be N.D. because the text doesn't specify the cDNA mutations, only the protein ones. 

Wait, but sometimes in literature, mutations are described with both cDNA and protein changes. However, in this text, it's only the protein changes. For example, "L166P" is a protein change. There's no mention of the cDNA sequence, so those fields would be N.D. 

So for each mutation, the cDNA Change is N.D., and the Protein Change has the ref, alt, position. The Description in input context is the mutation name as given in the text.

I need to check all the mutations mentioned. The text lists L166P, M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S. Each of these is a mutation in DJ-1. 

So the JSON would have "Gene": "DJ-1", and "variants" array with each of these mutations. Each variant's cDNA Change is N.D., Protein Change has the details, and the Description is the mutation name.

I should also check if there's any other mutation mentioned. The text also mentions "homozygous mutations of the DJ-1 gene" for M26I and L166P, but that's more about the mutation type (homozygous) rather than the mutation itself. So that's not part of the variant details but maybe part of the description. However, the user's example doesn't include such details, so perhaps stick to the specific mutation names and their protein changes.

So the final JSON should have all the mutations listed, with their protein changes and N.D. for cDNA changes.
