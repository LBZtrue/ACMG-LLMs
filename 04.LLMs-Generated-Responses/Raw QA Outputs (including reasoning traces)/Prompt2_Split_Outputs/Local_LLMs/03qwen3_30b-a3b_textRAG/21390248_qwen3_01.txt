Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. The task is to determine if the provided text has mutation information and extract it accordingly. If not, return "N.D.".

First, I need to look at the input text. The user provided an abstract and an introduction from a study on LRRK2 mutations in Parkinson's disease. The main question is about extracting mutation details.

Looking through the abstract, there's a section that says: "the common PD-related mutations of LRRK2, R1441G, Y1699C and G2019S, decrease homeostatic phosphorylation levels of S935 and impair 14-3-3 binding of LRRK2." So these are specific mutations mentioned. 

Now, I need to parse these mutations. The gene is LRRK2. The mutations listed are R1441G, Y1699C, and G2019S. Each of these is a protein change. Let's break them down:

- R1441G: Arginine (R) at position 1441 is replaced by Glycine (G).
- Y1699C: Tyrosine (Y) at position 1699 is replaced by Cysteine (C).
- G2019S: Glycine (G) at position 2019 is replaced by Serine (S).

The abstract doesn't mention cDNA changes, so those fields should be "N.D." The description in the context is the mutation names provided.

I need to structure this into the JSON format as per the example. The gene is LRRK2. Each variant has the protein change with ref, alt, position. The cDNA change is not mentioned, so "N.D." for transcript, ref, alt, position. The description is the mutation names.

I should check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The rest of the text talks about phosphorylation sites and 14-3-3 binding, but no other mutations. So the answer should include these three mutations. The JSON structure should have "Gene" as LRRK2 and the variants array with each mutation's details.
