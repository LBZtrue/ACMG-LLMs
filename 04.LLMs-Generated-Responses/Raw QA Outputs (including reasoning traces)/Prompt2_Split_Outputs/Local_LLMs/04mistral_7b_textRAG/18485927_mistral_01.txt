To answer your question, I will perform the data extraction based on the provided JSON format from the given text paragraph.

Input Text Paragraph: "To elucidate the structural and functional role of Uld in parkin at the atomic level, the X-ray crystal structure of murine Uld was determined and a molecular dynamics simulation of wild Uld and its five mutants (K27N, R33Q, R42P, K48A and V56E) identiﬁed from AR-JP patients was performed."

Extracted Information:

    "Gene": "parkin",
    "mutants": [
        {
            "wild_type": "N.D.",
