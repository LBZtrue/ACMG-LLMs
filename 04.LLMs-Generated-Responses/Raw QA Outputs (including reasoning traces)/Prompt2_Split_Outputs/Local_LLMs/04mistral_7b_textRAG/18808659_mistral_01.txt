To determine if the provided text contains mutation information, I will carefully read and analyze it for specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions as described in the workflow.

In this case, the provided input text paragraph does contain mutation-related information. The text specifies that three missense mutations (A30P, A53T, and E46K) are associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial Parkinson's disease (PD).

Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:
