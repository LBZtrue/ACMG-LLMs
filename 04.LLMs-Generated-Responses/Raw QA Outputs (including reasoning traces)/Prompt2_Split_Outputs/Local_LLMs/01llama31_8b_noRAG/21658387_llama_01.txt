To answer this question, I will carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

Input Text Paragraph:
"A study of lung cancer patients found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

After analyzing the input text paragraph, I can see that it mentions a specific "mutation" in the context of lung cancer and the TP53 gene.

Based on this information, I will extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```
The extracted information includes the gene name, cDNA change, protein change, and mutation description.

Note that I used "N.D." to supplement content not mentioned, such as the transcript ID for the cDNA change.

This workflow ensures accurate extraction of mutation-related information from large volumes of biomedical literature.
