To extract the mutation information from the provided text paragraphs, I will follow the specified workflow and use my expertise in medical literature data mining to accurately identify and extract relevant details.

**Text 1:**

"The E163K mutant fails to rescue under conditions of oxidative stress"

This paragraph does not contain any mutation-related terms or descriptions. Therefore, the extracted information is:

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": "N.D.",
            "Protein Change": "N.D.",
            "Description in input context": "E163K"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Text 2:**

"Figure 3. The E163K mutant fails to rescue under conditions of oxidative stress"

This paragraph is similar to Text 1 and does not contain any mutation-related terms or descriptions. Therefore, the extracted information is:

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": "N.D.",
            "Protein Change": "N.D.",
            "Description in input context": "E163K"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Text 3:**

"The E163K mutant does not show altered subcellular localization"

This paragraph does contain the mutation-related term "E163K", but it is not accompanied by any gene name, cDNA change, or protein change. Therefore, the extracted information is:

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": "N.D.",
            "Protein Change": "N.D.",
            "Description in input context": "E163K"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Text 4:**

"N2A cells were mock transfected or transiently transfected with either flag-tagged human WT or E163K mutant DJ-1 constructs."

This paragraph contains the mutation-related term "E163K" and a gene name ("DJ-1"). However, it does not provide any cDNA change or protein change information. Therefore, the extracted information is:

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": "N.D.",
            "Protein Change": "N.D.",
            "Description in input context": "E163K"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Text 5:**

"The E163K mutant fails to rescue under conditions of oxidative stress. N2A cells stably expressing WT (clone 11) or E163K (clone 16) human DJ-1 were treated either DMEM/FBS containing 20uM H2O2 or with DMEM/FBS."

This paragraph contains the mutation-related term "E163K" and a gene name ("DJ-1"). However, it does not provide any cDNA change or protein change information. Therefore, the extracted information is:

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": "N.D.",
            "Protein Change": "N.D.",
            "Description in input context": "E163K"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Text 6:**

"The E163K mutant does not show altered subcellular localization. N2A cells and stable cell clones of N2A cells expressing WT (clone 11) or E163K (clone 16) human DJ-1 were subjected to subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation."

This paragraph contains the mutation-related term "E163K" and a gene name ("DJ-1"). However, it does not provide any cDNA change or protein change information. Therefore, the extracted information is:

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": "N.D.",
            "Protein Change": "N.D.",
            "Description in input context": "E163K"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Text 7:**

"Figure 5. Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals an altered mitochondrial localization for E163K mutant DJ-1 protein in response to oxidative stress."

This paragraph contains the mutation-related term "E163K" and a gene name ("DJ-1"). However, it does not provide any cDNA change or protein change information. Therefore, the extracted information is:

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": "N.D.",
            "Protein Change": "N.D.",
            "Description in input context": "E163K"
        }
    ]
}
```

In summary, the extracted mutation information for all text paragraphs is:

```json
[
  {
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
      {
        "cDNA Change": {
