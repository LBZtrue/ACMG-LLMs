Based on the provided text, it appears to be a scientific article discussing the relationship between LRRK2 mutations and their effects on dopamine neurons in Drosophila melanogaster. The article includes figures and tables with specific data on gene expression, protein interactions, and behavioral outcomes.

To answer your question, I will follow the specified workflow to extract mutation information from the text:

1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.

Here's the extracted information in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": ["LRRK2", "E2F1", "DP"],
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "Pathogenic forms of LRRK2 suppress let-7 function and interact with RISC component Argonaute (Fig. 1), leading to altered E2F1 and DP expression (Fig. 2)"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that the extracted information is limited, as the article does not provide explicit mutation descriptions or cDNA changes for the mentioned genes. The description in the input context refers to the overall effect of pathogenic LRRK2 on E2F1 and DP expression. To meet the format requirements, "N.D." has been used to supplement missing information.
