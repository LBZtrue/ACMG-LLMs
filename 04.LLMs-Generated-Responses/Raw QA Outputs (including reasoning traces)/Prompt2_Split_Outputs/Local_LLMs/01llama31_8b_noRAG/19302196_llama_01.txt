Based on the provided text, I will extract information related to mutations from the paragraphs of medical literature.

The given text is a list of references to various studies and articles about LRRK2 gene mutations. The relevant paragraph for mutation extraction is:

"Mata I. F., Kachergus J. M., Taylor J. P. et al. (2005) Lrrk2 pathogenic substitutions in Parkinson’s disease. Neurogenetics 6, 171–177."

From this paragraph, we can identify the following mutation-related information:

* Gene: LRRK2
* Mutations:
	+ "pathogenic substitutions"
	+ No specific cDNA changes or protein changes are mentioned.

However, another paragraph mentions a study that identified the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene as causing Parkinson's disease in Ashkenazi Jews:

"Ozelius L. J., Senthil G., Saunders-Pullman R. et al. (2006) LRRK2 G2019S as a cause of Parkinson’s disease in Ashkenazi Jews. N. Engl. J. Med. 354, 424–425."

From this paragraph, we can extract the following mutation-related information:

* Gene: LRRK2
* Mutations:
	+ "G2019S"
	+ Description: causes Parkinson's disease in Ashkenazi Jews

Since there is no specific mention of cDNA changes or protein changes for the G2019S mutation, we will supplement this information with "N.D.".

Here are the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

                        "ref": "pathogenic substitutions"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {

                        "position": "N.D."
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "pathogenic substitutions in Parkinson’s disease"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
