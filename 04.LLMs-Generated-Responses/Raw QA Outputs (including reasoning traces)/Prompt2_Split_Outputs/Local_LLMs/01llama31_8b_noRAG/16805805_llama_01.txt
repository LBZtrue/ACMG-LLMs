To answer the question, I will carefully read the provided text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

The input text paragraph is:
"Altered cleavage and localization of PINK1"

After reading the paragraph, I can see that it mentions "PINK1", which is a gene associated with Parkinson's disease. However, there is no explicit mention of mutations in this context.

Since the goal is to extract information related to mutations if present, and given that the input text does not contain any mutation-related terms or descriptions, I will return "N.D." (Not Determined) for each field.

Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [],
    "Description in input context": "Altered cleavage and localization of PINK1"
}
```

Please note that I have not found any mutation-related terms or descriptions in the provided text paragraph.
