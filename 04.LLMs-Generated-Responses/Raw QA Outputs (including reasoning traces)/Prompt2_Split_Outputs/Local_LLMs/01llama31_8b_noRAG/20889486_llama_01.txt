Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information related to mutations.

**Text:** "The effects of oxidative stress on parkin and other E3 ligases."

**Mutation Information:** None found in the text.

However, let's consider another example where mutation information is present:

**Text:** "LaVoie et al. (2007) reported that the p.Ile251Met mutation in the parkin gene is associated with Parkinson's disease."

**Extracted Information:**

```json
{
    "Gene": "parkin",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "I",
                "alt": "M",
                "position": "251"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "I",
                "alt": "M",
                "position": "251"
            },
            "Description in input context": "p.Ile251Met mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, I have extracted the gene name "parkin", the cDNA change (transcript not mentioned), protein change ("I" to "M"), and a brief description of the mutation ("p.Ile251Met mutation"). Note that the transcript information is marked as "N.D." since it's not specified in the text.
