Here is the output for the given example:

```json
{
  "Gene": "TP53",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A",
        "position": "248"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "D",
        "position": "83"
      },
      "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The input text paragraph mentions the "TP53 gene" which is a specific gene, so it matches the requirement for extracting mutation-related information.

2. The input text also contains the cDNA change description "(c.248G>A)" and the protein change description "(p.G83D)", so they are extracted as well.

3. Since the transcript information is not available in the input context, "N.D." (Not Determined) is used to supplement that content.

4. The position of the cDNA change and protein change are correctly identified from the input text.

5. All the extracted information matches the specified JSON format required for output.

Here's another example:

Input Text Paragraph: "The study found a strong association between Parkinson's disease and mutations in the SNCA gene, particularly the duplication of the 4q21-22 region."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "duplication of the 4q21-22 region"
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The input text paragraph mentions mutations in the SNCA gene which matches the requirement for extracting mutation-related information.

2. Since the specific cDNA change, protein change, and their positions are not available in the input context, "N.D." is used to supplement that content.

3. However, it does mention the duplication of a particular region of the chromosome (4q21-22), which could be considered as mutation-related information but the text is quite ambiguous.

4. All the extracted information matches the specified JSON format required for output.

And another example:

Input Text Paragraph: "Researchers have discovered that certain genetic mutations can cause amyloid formation in the brain."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "certain genetic mutations"
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

1. The input text paragraph mentions certain genetic mutations but it does not specify the gene, cDNA change, or protein change.

2. Therefore, all the fields are marked with "N.D." as there is no specific information available in the input context.

3. However, it does mention that these mutations can cause amyloid formation in the brain which is mutation-related information but the text is quite ambiguous.

4. All the extracted information matches the specified JSON format required for output.

Note: These examples demonstrate how to extract relevant details from text and supplement content with "N.D." when necessary.
