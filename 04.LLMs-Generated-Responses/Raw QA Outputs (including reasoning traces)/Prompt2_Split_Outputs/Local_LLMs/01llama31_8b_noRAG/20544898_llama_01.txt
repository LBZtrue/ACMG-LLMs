To solve this problem, I'll follow the given workflow and use my medical literature data mining expertise to carefully read the provided text paragraph.

Input Text Paragraph:
"Recently, a study has revealed that the A53E mutation in the alpha-synuclein protein is associated with neurodegenerative disorders."

Since this text mentions "A53E mutation," I'll proceed to extract relevant details according to the specified format.

Extracted Information:

```json
{
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "E",
                "position": "53"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "E",
                "position": "53"
            },
            "Description in input context": "A53E mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

Here is the extracted information with gene name, variant details, and description in the specified format. Note that the transcript position for cDNA change is not mentioned, so it's supplemented with "N.D." to follow the requirements.
