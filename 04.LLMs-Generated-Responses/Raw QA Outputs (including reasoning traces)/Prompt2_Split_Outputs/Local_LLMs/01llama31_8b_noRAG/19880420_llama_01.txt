To solve this problem, I'll follow the provided workflow and extract information related to mutations from the input text paragraph.

**Input Text Paragraph:** "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

**Step 1: Identify Mutation-Related Terms**

The input text contains the term "mutation" and describes a specific genetic change.

**Step 2: Extract Gene Name and Mutation Description**

From the input text, I can extract:

* Gene: TP53
* Mutation Description: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**Step 3: Extract Specific Information**

I will now break down the mutation description into its components:

*   cDNA Change:
    *   transcript: N.D.
    *   ref: G
    *   alt: A
    *   position: 248
*   Protein Change:
    *   ref: G
    *   alt: D
    *   position: 83

**Step 4: Supplement Content Not Mentioned**

For the missing information, I will use "N.D." to supplement the content.

**Final Extracted Information:**

```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output contains the extracted information related to the mutation, following the specified format and using "N.D." for missing content.
