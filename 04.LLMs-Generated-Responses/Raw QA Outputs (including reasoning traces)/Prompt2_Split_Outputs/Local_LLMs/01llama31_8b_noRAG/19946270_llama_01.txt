To extract the mutation information from the given text paragraph, I will follow the specified workflow:

1. Read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

The input text paragraph is: "In a study of glioblastoma patients, it was found that tumor-derived mutations disrupt PARK2-mediated ubiquitination in cancer cells."

This paragraph mentions the following mutation-related terms:

- Tumor-derived mutations
- PARK2
- Ubiquitination

Based on this information, I will extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

**Mutation Information:**

```json
{
    "Gene": "PARK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "Tumor-derived mutations disrupt PARK2-mediated ubiquitination"
        }
    ]
}
```

As the paragraph does not provide specific details about cDNA or protein changes, I have supplemented this information with "N.D." to ensure that the returned format is complete and meets the requirements.

However, it's worth noting that the text mentions several mutations in PARK2 within a table (Tables 1 and 2). If we were to consider these tables as part of the input text, then we would have more specific mutation information available for extraction.
