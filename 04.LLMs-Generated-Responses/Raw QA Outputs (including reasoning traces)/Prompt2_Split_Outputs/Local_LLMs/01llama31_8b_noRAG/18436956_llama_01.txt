To solve this problem, I will use the following steps:

1. Read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.

Here's the extracted information for each input text paragraph:

**Example 1:**
Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Example 2:**
Input text paragraph: "The LRRK2 gene has a mutation that is associated with Parkinson's disease."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "LRRK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Example 3:**
Input text paragraph: "The DJ-1 protein has a mutation that is associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Example 4:**
Input text paragraph: "There is no mention of mutations in this paragraph."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "N.D."
        }
    ]
}
