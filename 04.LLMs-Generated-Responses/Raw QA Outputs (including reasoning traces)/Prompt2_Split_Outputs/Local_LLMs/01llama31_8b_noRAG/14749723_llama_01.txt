To solve this problem, I will carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
"Mutations in the DJ-1 gene associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism. Science 299: 256–259"

Since the input text paragraph does contain mutation-related terms, I will proceed to extract specific information related to mutations.

**Extracted Information:**

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "Description in context": "Mutations associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I did not extract specific cDNA changes or protein changes as they are not explicitly mentioned in the input text paragraph. However, I included a description of the mutation in the context of the input text to provide relevant information.

Also, note that this is an example and actual extracted information may vary depending on the complexity of the input text paragraph.
