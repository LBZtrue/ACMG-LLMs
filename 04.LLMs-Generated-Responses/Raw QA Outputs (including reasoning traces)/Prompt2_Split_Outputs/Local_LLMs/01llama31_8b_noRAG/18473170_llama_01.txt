Based on the provided text paragraph, I will extract the relevant information related to mutations.

The input text paragraph is:
"The determinations were performed on NHDFs or patient’s ﬁbroblasts grown in the exponential phase as described under ‘‘Methods’’. The P value assessed by two tailed Student’s t-test shows signiﬁcant difference of NHDF versus PINK1mutF"

I will carefully read this paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

Upon reviewing the text, I did not find any explicit information related to mutations. However, I noticed that "PINK1mutF" is mentioned as a comparison group in the context of assessing significant differences using a two-tailed Student's t-test.

Since there is no direct mention of specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, or mutation descriptions, I will supplement the content with "N.D." to ensure that the returned information meets the format requirements.

Here is the extracted information in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "PINK1mutF"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that the information is minimal, and it's primarily related to a comparison group ("PINK1mutF") rather than specific mutation details.
