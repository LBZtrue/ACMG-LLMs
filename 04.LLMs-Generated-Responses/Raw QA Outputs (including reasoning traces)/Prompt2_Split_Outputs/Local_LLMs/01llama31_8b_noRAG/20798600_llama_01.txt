Based on the provided text, I will follow the specified workflow to extract mutation information.

**Input Text Paragraph:**

"A novel PINK1 mutation was identified in a family with early-onset Parkinson's disease. The mutation was found to be located at position 248 in the cDNA of the PINK1 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid to aspartic acid substitution at position 83 (c.248G>A; p.E83D)."

**Step 1:** Identify whether the input text paragraph contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

Yes, the text mentions "novel PINK1 mutation" and describes it with specific cDNA and protein changes.

**Step 2:** Extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

From the input text:

* Gene: PINK1
* variants:
	+ cDNA Change:
		- transcript: N.D.
		- ref: G
		- alt: A
		- position: 248
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: E
		- alt: D
		- position: 83
	+ Description in input context: c.248G>A (p.E83D)

**JSON Output Format:**

```json
{
    "Gene": "PINK1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "E",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.E83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```

The final answer is: 

```json
{
    "Gene": "PINK1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "E",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.E83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```
