To extract the mutation information from the given medical literature text, I will follow the provided workflow and use my skills as a professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert.

**Input Text:** The input text paragraph is:

"The DJ-1 protein is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). The L166P mutant protein associated with early onset PD is unstable and forms higher-order protein complexes."

**Step 1: Identify mutation-related terms or descriptions.**

Upon reading the input text, I found that it mentions "Parkinson's disease" and "DJ-1 protein." However, these are not specific mutation-related terms. The term "L166P mutant protein" is mentioned, which refers to a specific mutation.

**Step 2: Extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions if present.**

Based on the input text, I found that:

- The mutation related to Parkinson's disease is described as "L166P."
- This mutation affects the DJ-1 protein.
- There is no mention of a specific cDNA change or protein change in the context of this mutation.

**Step 3: For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." (Not Determined) to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.**

Since there is no information about cDNA changes, protein changes, or a description in the input text for this specific mutation, I will supplement these fields with "N.D."

**Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.**

Here is the extracted information in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "DJ-1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Description in input context": "L166P mutant protein"
    }
  ]
}
```

The final answer is: 

```json
{
  "Gene": "DJ-1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Description in input context": "L166P mutant protein"
    }
  ]
}
```
