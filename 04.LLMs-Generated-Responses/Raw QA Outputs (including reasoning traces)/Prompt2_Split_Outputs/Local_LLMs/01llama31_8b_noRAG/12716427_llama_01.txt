**Input Text Paragraph:** 
"alpha-Synuclein in Lewy bodies was studied and it was found that A53T mutant but not wild-type alpha-synuclein in PC12 cells induces alterations of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation system, loss of dopamine release, and autophagic cell death."

**Extracted Information:**
```json
{
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "T",
                "position": "53"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "M",
                "alt": "V",
                "position": "17"
            },
            "Description in input context": "A53T mutant but not wild-type alpha-synuclein"
        }
    ]
}
```
**Explanation:** 
Based on the input text paragraph, we identified that it contains information related to mutations. Specifically, it mentions alpha-Synuclein and its A53T mutation. We extracted the gene name as "SNCA" (alpha-Synuclein is encoded by this gene), cDNA change as "c.53A>T", protein change as "M17V", and description in input context as "A53T mutant but not wild-type alpha-synuclein". The transcript, ref, alt, and position information for the cDNA change were supplemented with "N.D." since it was not provided in the original text.
