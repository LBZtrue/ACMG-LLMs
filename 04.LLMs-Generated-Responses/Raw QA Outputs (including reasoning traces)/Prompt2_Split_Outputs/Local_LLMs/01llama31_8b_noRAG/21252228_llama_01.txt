To solve this problem, I will follow the provided workflow and use my expertise as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert to carefully analyze the input text paragraph.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
```
Petruccelli et al. (2002) Neuron 36, 1007–1019
54. Fournier, M., Vitte, J., Garrigue, J., Langui, D., Dullin, J. P., Saurini, F.,
Hanoun, N., Perez-Diaz, F., Cornilleau, F., Joubert, C., Ardila-Osorio, H.,
Traver, S., Duchateau, R., Goujet-Zalc, C., Paleologou, K., Lashuel, H. A.,
Haass, C., Duyckaerts, C., Cohen-Salmon, C., Kahle, P. J., Hamon, M.,
Brice, A., and Corti, O. (2009) PLoS One 4, e6629 Brice, A., and Corti, O. (2009) PLoS One 4, e6629
```

**Analysis:**

Upon examining the input text paragraph, I identified a study by Petruccelli et al. in 2002, which is related to mutations in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.

**Mutation Information Extraction:**
The relevant mutation information is not directly stated in the provided snippet; however, it mentions Petrucelli et al.'s study on neurodegenerative diseases and several other studies that are linked but do not provide specific details. Unfortunately, without more context or a clear description of the mutations involved, I am unable to extract any meaningful data.

**Output:**
Since there is no direct information related to mutations in the input text paragraph, I will return "N.D." (Not Determined) as per the specified output format.
