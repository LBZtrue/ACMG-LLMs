Based on the input text paragraph, I will extract information related to mutations and return it in the specified JSON format.

Input Text Paragraph:
"Hereditary early-onset Parkinson’s disease caused by mutations in PINK1. Science 304: 1158–1160"

Extracted Information:

```json
{
    "Gene": "PINK1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "mutations"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: Since the input text paragraph does not provide specific mutation information, I have supplemented the extracted details with "N.D." to ensure that the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
