To determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations, I will carefully read the paragraph and identify relevant terms or descriptions.

The given text is:

"Heterozygous PINK1 Mutations and Associated Clinical Features"

This text appears to be a title of a section in a medical literature article. However, there is no mutation-related information directly mentioned in this title.

However, if we look at the subsequent paragraphs, we can find some relevant information related to mutations:

Exon
Nucleotide change
Amino acid
change
Number of
patients
Number of
controls
Reported clinical features
Source of information

This text contains a table with various rows, each representing a mutation. However, to extract the necessary information, we need to analyze each row and identify relevant details.

Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:
