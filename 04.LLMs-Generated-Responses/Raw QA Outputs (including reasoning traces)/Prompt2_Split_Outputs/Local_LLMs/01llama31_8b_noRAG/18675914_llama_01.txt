To answer the question, I will carefully read the input text paragraph and extract relevant mutation information.

The input text paragraph is:

`Figure 4. Impact of LRRK2 wild-type and mutants on basal viability and cell viability in response to H2O2 insult in SH-SY5Y cells`

From this figure title, it appears that there are some mutations mentioned: `LRRK2 wild-type`, `Y1699C mutant`, `G2019S`. Let's extract the mutation information:

* Gene: LRRK2
* variants:
  + Y1699C mutant
    - cDNA Change: N.D.
    - Protein Change: N.D.
    - Description in input context: "Y1699C"
  + G2019S
    - cDNA Change: N.D.
    - Protein Change: N.D.
    - Description in input context: "G2019S"

Note that the protein change and cDNA change are not explicitly mentioned in the figure title. I will return a JSON object with the extracted information:

```json

  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",

      },
      "Protein Change": {

      "Description in input context": "Y1699C"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",

      },
      "Description in input context": "G2019S"
    }
  ]
}
