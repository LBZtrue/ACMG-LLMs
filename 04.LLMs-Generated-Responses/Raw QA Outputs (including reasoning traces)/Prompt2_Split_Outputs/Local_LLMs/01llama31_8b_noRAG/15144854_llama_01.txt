To solve this problem, I will carefully analyze the provided text paragraph to identify mutation-related terms or descriptions. If mutation information is found, I will extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

The input text paragraph is:
```
Kruger, R., Kuhn, W., Muller, T., Woitalla, D., Graeber, M., Kosel, S.,
Przuntek, H., Epplen, J.T., Schols, L., Riess, O., 1998. Ala30Pro mu-
tation in the gene encoding alpha-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease.
Nat. Genet. 18, 106–108.
```

Based on this text, I can see that it is discussing a specific mutation associated with Parkinson's disease. The relevant information is:

* Gene: Alpha-synuclein
* Variants:
	+ cDNA Change: Ala30Pro (this implies a change at position 30 in the protein)
	+ Protein Change: Ala30Pro (this is a direct description of the change)

Since there are no other mutation-related terms or descriptions mentioned, I will supplement the returned information with "N.D." where necessary.

Here is the extracted information in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": "Alpha-synuclein",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "Ala",
                "alt": "Pro",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Description in input context": "Ala30Pro mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON format meets the specified requirements, including providing gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions. Where necessary, I have supplemented the information with "N.D." to ensure completeness.
