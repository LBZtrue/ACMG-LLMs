Based on the provided text paragraph:

"The role of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in Parkinson’s disease, Ann. Neurol. 54 (2003) 283–286."

Here is the extracted information in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Gene": "DJ-1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "pathogenic DJ-1 mutations"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that since the input text does not provide specific information about cDNA changes or protein changes, we leave these fields as "N.D." to indicate that they are not mentioned. Similarly, we do not have a mutation description for this particular paragraph. 

However, if you'd like me to extract more general mutation-related information from the provided paragraphs, please let me know!
