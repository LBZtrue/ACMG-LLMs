Here's the extracted information from the input text paragraph:

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.A.",
        "alt": "N.A.",
        "position": "N.A."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.A.",
        "alt": "N.A.",
        "position": "N.A."
      },
      "Description in input context": "LRRK2 R1628P increases risk of Parkinson’s disease: replication evidence"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the extracted information is specific to the LRRK2 gene and its variants, as mentioned in the input text paragraph. The provided JSON format includes the gene name, variant description, cDNA change (which is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context), protein change (also not explicitly mentioned), and a description of the mutation in the input context.

If any content was missing or not mentioned in the input text paragraph, "N.D." has been used to supplement the extracted information accordingly.
