To accurately extract mutation information from the provided medical literature, I will carefully follow the specified workflow and use my expertise in medical literature data mining to identify and extract relevant details.

Input Text Paragraph:
"The E46K mutation in R-synuclein is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease."

Workflow Execution:

1. Carefully read the input text paragraph: The input text mentions "E46K" as a specific mutation.
2. Identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions: Yes, it does.
3. Extract specific gene names: R-synuclein
4. Extract cDNA changes: E46K (note: the format of cDNA change is not explicitly mentioned in this context)
5. Extract protein changes: N.D. (since the input text only mentions a mutation and not a specific protein change)
6. Extract mutation descriptions: The E46K mutation

JSON Output:
```json
{
    "Gene": "R-synuclein",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "E",
                "position": 46
            },
            "Protein Change": N.D.,
            "Description in input context": "The E46K mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```
Please note that the cDNA change is not explicitly mentioned in this format, but for the purpose of this exercise and following the specified workflow, I assumed a simplified representation. In a real-world scenario, you would need to adjust this based on the actual text and your understanding of biomedical terminology.

In cases where the input text does not contain mutation information, you should return "N.D." as per the constraints.
