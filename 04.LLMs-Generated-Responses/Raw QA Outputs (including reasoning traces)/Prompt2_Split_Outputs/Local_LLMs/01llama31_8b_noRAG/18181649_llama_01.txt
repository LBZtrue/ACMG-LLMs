To address the task, I will follow the specified workflow and use my expertise in medical literature data mining to extract mutation information from the given text paragraphs.

**Input Text Paragraph 1**

The input text paragraph is:
"In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

Following the specified workflow:

1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

Yes, the input text paragraph mentions a specific mutation "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" in the "TP53" gene.

2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

Gene: TP53
variants:
- cDNA Change:
  - transcript: N.D.
  - ref: G
  - alt: A
  - position: 248
- Protein Change:
  - ref: G
  - alt: D
  - position: 83
Description in input context: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**Output**

The extracted information will be returned in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Input Text Paragraph 2**

The input text paragraph is:
"The study analyzed the effects of mutations in the E163K and M26I genes on protein structure and function."

Following the specified workflow:

1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

Yes, the input text paragraph mentions specific mutations "E163K" and "M26I".

2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

Gene: E163K
variants:
- Protein Change:
  - ref: N.D.
  - alt: K
  - position: 163

 Gene: M26I
variants:
- Protein Change:
  - ref: N.D.
  - alt: I
  - position: 26

**Output**

The extracted information will be returned in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": [
        {
            "name": "E163K"
        },
        {
            "name": "M26I"
        }
    ],
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": N.D.,
                "alt": K,
                "position": 163
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": N.D.,
                "alt": K,
                "position": 163
            }
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": N.D.,
                "alt": I,
                "position": 26
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": N.D.,
                "alt": I,
                "position": 26
            }
        }
    ]
}
