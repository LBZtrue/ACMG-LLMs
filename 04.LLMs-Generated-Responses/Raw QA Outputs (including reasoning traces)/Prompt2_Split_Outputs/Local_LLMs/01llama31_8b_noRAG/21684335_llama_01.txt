# Example usage
input_text = "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

```
This code uses regular expressions to extract gene names, cDNA changes, and protein changes from the input text paragraph. It then constructs a dictionary containing the extracted information and returns it in JSON format.

Note that this implementation assumes that the mutation-related terms are explicitly mentioned in the input text using specific formatting (e.g., "c.248G>A"). If the text uses different formatting or contains implicit mutation-related information, additional regular expressions or natural language processing techniques may be necessary to extract the relevant details accurately.
