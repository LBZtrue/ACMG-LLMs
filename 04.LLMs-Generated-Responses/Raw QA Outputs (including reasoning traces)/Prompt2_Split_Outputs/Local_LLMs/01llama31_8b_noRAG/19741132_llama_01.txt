To solve this problem, we will follow the provided workflow.

**Step 1:** Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

The input text paragraph is:

"The familial Parkinsonism gene LRRK2 regulates neurite process morphology. Paisa´n-Ruíz C, Jain S, Evans EW, Gilks WP, Simo´n J, van der Brug M, Lo´pez de Munain A, Aparicio S, Gil AM, Khan N, Johnson J, Martinez JR, Nicholl D, Carrera IM, Pena AS, de Silva R, Lees A, Martí-Masso´ JF, Pe´rez-Tur J, Wood NW, Singleton AB (2004) Cloning of the gene containing mutations that cause PARK8-linked Parkinson’s disease. Neuron 44:595–600."

**Step 2:** If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

From the input text paragraph, we can identify several sentences related to mutations:

1. "The familial Parkinsonism gene LRRK2 regulates neurite process morphology."
   - Gene: LRRK2
   - No mutation information provided, so we will mark it as N.D. for now.

2. "Paisa´n-Ruíz C, Jain S, Evans EW, Gilks WP, Simo´n J, van der Brug M, Lo´pez de Munain A, Aparicio S, Gil AM, Khan N, Johnson J, Martinez JR, Nicholl D, Carrera IM, Pena AS, de Silva R, Lees A, Martí-Masso´ JF, Pe´rez-Tur J, Wood NW, Singleton AB (2004) Cloning of the gene containing mutations that cause PARK8-linked Parkinson’s disease. Neuron 44:595–600."
   - Gene: LRRK2
   - Mutation description: "mutations that cause PARK8-linked Parkinson’s disease"

3. "Lesage S, Du¨rr A, Tazir M, Lohmann E, Leutenegger AL, Janin S, Pollak P, Brice A, Brice A (2006) LRRK2 G2019S as a cause of Parkinson’s disease in North African Arabs. N Engl J Med 354:422–423."
   - Gene: LRRK2
   - Mutation description: "G2019S"

4. "Lim KL, Ng CH (2009) Genetic models of Parkinson disease. Biochim Bio-phys Acta 1792:604–615."
   - No mutation information provided.

5. "Liu Z, Wang X, Yu Y, Li X, Wang T, Jiang H, Ren Q, Jiao Y, Sawa A, Moran T, Ross CA, Montell C, Smith WW (2008) A Drosophila model for LRRK2-linked parkinsonism. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 105:2693–2698."
   - Gene: LRRK2
   - No mutation information provided.

**Step 3:** For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.

From our analysis, we have extracted the following mutation-related information:

```json
{
    "Gene": [
        {
            "name": "LRRK2"
        },
        {
            "name": "PARK8"
        }
    ],
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "mutations that cause PARK8-linked Parkinson’s disease"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "S",
                "position": "2019"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "G2019S"
        }
    ]
}
```

Please note that some fields are marked as N.D. because we do not have enough information to fill them in accurately.

However, it seems like the output is not exactly following the expected format and some details might be missing or incorrect based on our analysis of the input text.

Here's a more accurate representation based on what was provided in the input:

```json
{
    "Gene": ["LRRK2"],
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {"ref": "N.D.", "alt": "N.D.", "position": "N.D."},
            "Protein Change": {"ref": "N.D.", "alt": "N.D.", "position": "N.D."},
            "Description in input context": "mutations that cause PARK8-linked Parkinson’s disease"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {"ref": "N.D.", "alt": "S", "position": "2019"},
            "Protein Change": {"ref": "N.D.", "alt": "N.D.", "position": "N.D."},
            "Description in input context": "G2019S"
        }
    ]
}
