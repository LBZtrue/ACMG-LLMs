To extract the mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraph, I will follow the specified workflow.

Input text paragraph:
"The new mutation, E46K, of alpha-synuclein causes Parkinson and Lewy body dementia. Ann Neurol 55:164–173."

Step 1: Identify whether the input text paragraph contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
The text mentions a "new mutation" specifically referencing "E46K" in the context of alpha-synuclein, indicating that it is related to mutations.

Step 2: Extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
From the input text:
- Gene name: alpha-synuclein
- Mutation description: E46K (no cDNA or protein change information is provided)
- No additional variants are mentioned in the context.

Since no additional variants are mentioned in the context, we will supplement with "N.D." for content not mentioned.

Output in JSON format:
```json
{
    "Gene": "alpha-synuclein",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "K",
                "position": "46"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "E",
                "alt": "K",
                "position": "46"
            },
            "Description in input context": "E46K"
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes the extracted mutation information with "N.D." for the cDNA change and protein change fields, as specific details were not provided.
