The given text paragraph is a medical literature excerpt discussing the effects of alpha-synuclein mutations on neurodegeneration. To extract mutation information, follow these steps:

1. Identify mutation-related terms or descriptions in the input text paragraph.

Upon reviewing the text, it appears that there are several references to alpha-synuclein and its various mutations. However, specific details about these mutations are not provided in a format suitable for extraction (e.g., gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes). 

To proceed, I will extract mutation-related information from the paragraph.

2. Extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions from the input text paragraph.

From the given excerpt:

- The term "alpha-synuclein" refers to a protein involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's.
- There are mentions of mutations (e.g., "Ala30Pro", "E46K") but no specific gene names, cDNA changes, or protein changes provided.

Based on this information:
