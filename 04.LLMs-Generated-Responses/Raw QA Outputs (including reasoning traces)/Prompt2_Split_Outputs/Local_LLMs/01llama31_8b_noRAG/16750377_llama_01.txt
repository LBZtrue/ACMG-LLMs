To extract the mutation information from the given paragraph, I will follow the steps outlined in the workflow.

Input text paragraph:
"The LRRK2 gene is associated with Parkinson's disease and mutations in this gene can cause the disease. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene include G2019S, R1441G, and others."

Here are the extracted information:

```json
{
    "Gene": "LRRK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "S",
                "position": "2019"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "S",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "G2019S"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "R",
                "alt": "G",
                "position": "1441"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "R",
                "alt": "G",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "R1441G"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that the position of the protein change is not specified, so it's marked as "N.D."
