To solve this problem, I will follow the workflow outlined by the user:

1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.

The input text paragraph is: 
"The GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH1) mutations in a study of dopa-responsive hereditary progressive dystonia was induced by a dominant-negative mechanism."

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Read the input text paragraph carefully to identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

* The input text mentions "mutations" and specifically refers to "GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH1)" which is a gene.
* It also mentions that these mutations are induced by a dominant-negative mechanism, indicating that the context discusses genetic changes affecting protein function.

Step 2: Extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions from the text.

* The input text specifically mentions the gene "GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH1)".
* There's no mention of cDNA or protein change in the context, suggesting these details might not be available for this specific mutation. Therefore, we'll leave them as "N.D." (Not Determined).
* The dominant-negative mechanism is described as affecting the gene's function.

Step 3: For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D."

* Since no cDNA or protein changes are provided in the input text, these fields will be marked as "N.D."
* Mutation descriptions include the effect on the gene's function due to being a dominant-negative mechanism.

Here's the extracted information in the JSON format specified:
```json
{
    "Gene": "GTPCH1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": { "transcript": "N.D.", "ref": "N.D.", "alt": "N.D.", "position": "N.D." },
            "Protein Change": { "ref": "N.D.", "alt": "N.D.", "position": "N.D." },
            "Description in input context": "Mutations induced by a dominant-negative mechanism"
        }
    ]
}
```
Note that the extracted information reflects the content of the input text, with "N.D." indicating where specific details were not provided.
