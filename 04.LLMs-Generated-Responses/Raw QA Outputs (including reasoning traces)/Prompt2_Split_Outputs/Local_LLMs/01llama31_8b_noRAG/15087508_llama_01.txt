To answer this question accurately, I will carefully analyze the given text paragraphs and extract relevant mutation information.

**Paragraph 1:**

The first paragraph describes a study on Parkinson's disease patients who carry mutations in the PINK1 gene. The mutations are described as c.1099C>A (p.R367Q) and c.1628G>A (p.E543K). These mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease.

**Extracted Information:**

```json
{
    "Gene": "PINK1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "C",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "1099"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "R",
                "alt": "Q",
                "position": "367"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.1099C>A (p.R367Q)"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "1628"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "E",
                "alt": "K",
                "position": "543"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.1628G>A (p.E543K)"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Paragraph 2:**

The second paragraph discusses the genetic structure of purebred domestic dogs and describes a study on 85 dog breeds. The researchers used molecular markers to study genetic relationships among the breeds.

**Extracted Information:**

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": []
}
```

In this case, there is no mutation information in the paragraph, so I will return "N.D." as per the instructions.

Please let me know if you would like me to extract more information or clarify any part of my response.
