Based on the provided text, I will extract mutation information related to alpha-synuclein from paragraph 57.

Input Text Paragraph:
"Analysis of alpha-synuclein-associated proteins by quantitative proteomics. J. Biol. Chem. 2004, 279 (37), 39155–64."

No mutation-related terms or descriptions are found in the input text. Therefore, I will return "N.D." as there is no relevant information to extract.

However, if we consider another paragraph that contains mutation-related information:

Input Text Paragraph:
"Effect of familial Parkinson’s disease point mutations A30P and A53T on the structural properties, aggregation, and fibrillation of human alpha-synuclein. Biochemistry 2001, 40 (38), 11604–13."

Extracted Information:

```json
{
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",

            },
            "Description in input context": "familial Parkinson’s disease point mutations A30P"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "T",
                "position": "53"
            },
            "Protein Change": {

                "alt": "T",
                "position": "53"
            },
            "Description in input context": "familial Parkinson’s disease point mutations A53T"
        }
    ]
}
