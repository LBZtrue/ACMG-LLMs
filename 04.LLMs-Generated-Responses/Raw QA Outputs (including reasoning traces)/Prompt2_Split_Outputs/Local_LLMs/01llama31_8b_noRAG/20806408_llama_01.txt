Based on the provided text, I can extract the mutation information as follows:

**Text to Analyze:**
The extracted information is related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature.

**Mutation Information Extraction:**

1. The input text paragraph mentions specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
2. For each mutation description, extract the relevant details such as Gene name, variants (including cDNA Change, Protein Change), and Description in input context.
3. Supplement with "N.D." for content not mentioned.

**Extracted Information:**

```json
{
  "Gene": "DJ-1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "L10P"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "P",
        "alt": "L",
        "position": "10"
      },
      "Description in input context": "L10P mutation"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "L166P"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "P",
        "alt": "L",
        "position": "166"
      },
      "Description in input context": "L166P mutation"
    },
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "P158DEL"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "P158DEL mutation"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:**

* The extracted information includes specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
* For the P158DEL mutation, some details were not mentioned, so "N.D." is used to supplement the content.
