To accurately extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text, I'll follow the specified workflow.

The input text paragraph is:
"Y1699C pathogenic mutant on the interaction between ROC and COR or COR-kinase. A, GST pulldowns of 3xflag-COR (wt and Y1699C) and 3xflag-COR-kin (wt and Y1699C) transfected in HEK293T cells with GST-ROC as a bait. The left panel shows inputs, the central panel represents GST-ROC pulldowns, and the right panel represents GST pulldowns. Membranes were probed with Flag (M2; upper panels) and GST (bottom panels) antibodies."

Based on this text, I identify mutation-related terms or descriptions as follows:

1. Gene: N.D.
2. variants:
    - cDNA Change:
        - ref: C
        - alt: T
        - position: 1699
        - Description in input context: Y1699C
    - Protein Change:
        - ref: H
        - alt: Q
        - position: N.D.
3. Description in input context: The description of the mutation is given as "Y1699C", which implies a change from Cytosine (C) to Thymine (T) at position 1699, resulting in a change from Histidine (H) to Glutamine (Q) in the protein sequence.

The extracted information in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "C",
                "alt": "T",
                "position": "1699"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "H",
                "alt": "Q",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "Y1699C"
        }
    ]
}
```

The returned information is supplemented with "N.D." where content was not mentioned.
