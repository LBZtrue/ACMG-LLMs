Based on the provided text paragraph, I will extract the relevant mutation information.

The text mentions a specific gene, TP53, and a cDNA change, which is represented as "c.248G>A" in the input text. The protein change associated with this cDNA change is described as "p.G83D". Since the input context already provides the description of the mutation, I will directly extract the relevant details.

Here's the extracted information in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output contains the extracted gene name, cDNA change, protein change, and a description of the mutation as found in the input text paragraph.
