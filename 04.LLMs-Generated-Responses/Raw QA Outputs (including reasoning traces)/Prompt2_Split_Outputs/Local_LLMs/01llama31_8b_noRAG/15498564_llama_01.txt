To solve this problem, I'll follow the workflow and use my expertise in medical literature data mining to extract information related to mutations from the given text paragraph.

**Input Text Paragraph:** "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

**Step 1: Identify Mutation-Related Terms**

From the input text, I can see that the terms "mutation", "c.248G>A", and "TP53 gene" are related to mutations.

**Step 2: Extract Specific Gene Names, cDNA Changes, Protein Changes, and Mutation Descriptions**

* Gene: TP53
* variants:
	+ cDNA Change:
		- transcript: N.D.
		- ref: G
		- alt: A
		- position: 248
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: G
		- alt: D
		- position: 83
	+ Description in input context: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**Step 3: Supplement with "N.D." for Content Not Mentioned**

Since the input text does not mention any other mutation-related information, I will supplement the output with "N.D." as required.

**Output Format:** Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```

The final answer is the JSON output:
```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```
