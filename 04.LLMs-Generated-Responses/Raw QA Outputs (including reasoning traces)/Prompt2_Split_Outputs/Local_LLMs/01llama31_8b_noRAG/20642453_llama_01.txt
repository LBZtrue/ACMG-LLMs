To solve this task, we need to analyze the input text paragraph for mutation-related terms or descriptions and extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

Input Text Paragraph:
"The TP53 gene contains a G-to-A transition at position 248, resulting in a glycine-to-aspartate substitution at codon 83."

Step 1: Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
The input text paragraph mentions "G-to-A transition" and "glycine-to-aspartate substitution," which are indicators of a specific mutation.

Step 2: If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
Gene name: TP53
CDNA Change:
* Position: 248
* Reference (Ref): G
* Alternative (Alt): A
Protein Change:
* Reference (Ref): G
* Alternative (Alt): D
* Position: 83

Step 3: For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.

Output in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "G-to-A transition resulting in glycine-to-aspartate substitution at codon 83."
        }
    ]
}
```

If the mutation information is not found, return "N.D.".

So, the final code would be:

```python
import json

def extract_mutation_info(text):
    # Parse input text for mutation-related terms or descriptions
    if 'G-to-A transition' in text or 'glycine-to-aspartate substitution' in text:
        gene = "TP53"
        cDNA_change = {
            "transcript": "N.D.",
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "A",
            "position": 248
        }
        protein_change = {
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "D",
            "position": 83
        }
    else:
        return json.dumps({"error": "N.D."})

    # Create output in JSON format
    output = {
        "Gene": gene,
        "variants": [
            {
                "cDNA Change": cDNA_change,
                "Protein Change": protein_change,
                "Description in input context": "G-to-A transition resulting in glycine-to-aspartate substitution at codon 83."
            }
        ]
    }

    return json.dumps(output)

text = "The TP53 gene contains a G-to-A transition at position 248, resulting in a glycine-to-aspartate substitution at codon 83."
print(extract_mutation_info(text))
```
