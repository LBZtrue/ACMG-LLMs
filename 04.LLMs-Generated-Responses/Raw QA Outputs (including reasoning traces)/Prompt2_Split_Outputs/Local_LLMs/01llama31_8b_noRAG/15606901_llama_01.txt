To solve this problem, I will follow the specified workflow and use my knowledge of biomedical terminology and data mining techniques to extract relevant information from the provided text paragraphs.

### Step 1: Carefully read the input text paragraph

The input text paragraph is:

"A novel PDI-related protein involved in ER quality control in yeast was identified as Eps1. The authors found that this protein is responsible for recognizing misfolded proteins and directing them to the proteasome for degradation."

From this paragraph, I can identify that it does not contain information related to mutations.

### Step 2: Determine whether the input text paragraph contains mutation-related terms or descriptions

Based on my analysis, the input text paragraph does not mention any specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, or mutation descriptions. Therefore, I will return "N.D." for all extracted information fields.

### Output:

```json
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "N.D."
    }
  ]
}
```

Please note that the output will be identical for all text paragraphs that do not contain mutation information.
