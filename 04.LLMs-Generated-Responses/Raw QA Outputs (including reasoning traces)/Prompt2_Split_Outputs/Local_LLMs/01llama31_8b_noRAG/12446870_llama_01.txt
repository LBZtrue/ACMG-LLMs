Based on the provided text paragraph, I will extract the relevant information related to mutations.

The input text paragraph is:
"The DKC1 gene codes for dyskerin, a putative pseudouridine synthase, which is in a complex with box H ACA small nuclear RNAs and mediates posttranscriptional modification of ribosomal RNA through conversion of uridine (U) to pseudouridine (∅). Point mutations in the yeast homolog of DKC1 and loss of DKC1 expression in Drozophila melanogaster result in telomere shortening and genomic instability."

After carefully reading the text, I identified mutation-related terms and descriptions. The extracted information is as follows:

```json
{
  "Gene": "DKC1",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "Point mutations"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the text does not provide specific information about cDNA or protein changes, so I left those fields blank (using "N.D." to indicate that the content is not mentioned).
