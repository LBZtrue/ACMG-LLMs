To extract mutation information from the given text paragraph, I will follow the specified workflow.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
"The case described here underlines the blurred borders of mendelian parkinsonisms versus idiopathic PD, with relevant implications for genetic counseling and prognostic evaluations. Using a functional assay, we show that both mutations reported here abolish the protective effect of wild-type PINK1 against staurosporine-induced apoptosis, supporting a pathogenic role of mutant PINK1 in the neurodegenerative process in our patient."

**Step 1:** Carefully read the input text paragraph to identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

The text mentions "mutations" and specifically refers to "PINK1 mutations." This suggests that the paragraph does contain information related to mutations.

**Step 2:** If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

From the text, we can identify:

* Gene: PINK1
* Mutations:
	+ The text mentions "both mutations reported here," but it does not provide explicit details about these mutations. However, based on previous research (cited in the text), we know that PINK1 is associated with Parkinson's disease.
	+ We can infer that the two mutations are likely to be variants of PINK1, such as those previously described in scientific literature.

**Extracted Information:**

```json
{
    "Gene": "PINK1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "PINK1 mutations"
        }
    ]
}
```

Please note that the extracted information is limited due to the lack of explicit mutation details in the provided text. However, based on previous research and scientific literature, we can infer that PINK1 is associated with Parkinson's disease.
