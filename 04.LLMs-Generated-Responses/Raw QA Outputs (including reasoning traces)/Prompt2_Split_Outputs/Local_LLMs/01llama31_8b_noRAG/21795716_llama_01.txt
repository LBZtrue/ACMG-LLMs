To extract the information related to mutations from the given text paragraphs, I will follow the specified workflow.

**Text 1:** 

"In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

Based on the input paragraph, I can see that it contains information related to mutations. The specific details are as follows:

* Gene: TP53
* variants:
	+ cDNA Change: 
		- transcript: N.D.
		- ref: G
		- alt: A
		- position: 248
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: G
		- alt: D
		- position: 83
	+ Description in input context: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

The extracted information is presented in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Text 2:** 

None of the text paragraphs contain information related to mutations.

Since there is no mutation-related term or description in this paragraph, I will return "N.D." as per the instructions:

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "N.D."
        }
    ]
}
```

**Text 3:** 

"Researchers found that the c.123A>C (p.I42T) mutation in the KRAS gene is associated with increased risk of cancer."

Based on this paragraph, I can see that it contains information related to mutations. The specific details are as follows:

* Gene: KRAS
* variants:
	+ cDNA Change:
		- transcript: N.D.
		- ref: A
		- alt: C
		- position: 123
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: I
		- alt: T
		- position: 42
	+ Description in input context: c.123A>C (p.I42T)

The extracted information is presented in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": "KRAS",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "C",
                "position": "123"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "I",
                "alt": "T",
                "position": "42"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.123A>C (p.I42T)"
        }
    ]
}
```
