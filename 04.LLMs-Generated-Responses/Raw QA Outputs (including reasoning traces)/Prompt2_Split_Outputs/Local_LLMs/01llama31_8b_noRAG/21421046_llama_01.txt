To address the task, I will carefully examine each paragraph of medical literature provided and extract relevant information related to mutations.

Given that there is only one paragraph of text:
"In a study of PINK1-deficient mice, it was found that loss of pink1 function promotes mitophagy through effects on oxidative stress and mitochondrial fusion. This is associated with Parkinson's disease pathology."

Since the input text does not directly mention specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, or mutation descriptions related to mutations in the context of PINK1-deficient mice, I will return "N.D." for each field where no information is provided.

Here is the extracted information:

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "Loss of pink1 function promotes mitophagy through effects on oxidative stress and mitochondrial fusion, associated with Parkinson's disease pathology"
        }
    ]
}
