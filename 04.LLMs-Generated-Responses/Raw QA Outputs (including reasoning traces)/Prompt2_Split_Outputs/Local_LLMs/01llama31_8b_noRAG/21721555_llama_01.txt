Based on the provided text, I will extract information related to mutations from the paragraphs of medical literature.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
The first paragraph to analyze is:
"Sequence alignment of human and mouse αSyn; conserved residues are represented by dashed lines in the mouse sequence. Residue numbers are shown below the sequence and the N, NAC and C-terminal regions are identified above the sequence."

This paragraph does not contain any information related to mutations.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
The next paragraph to analyze is:
"Negatively stained electron micrographs of the end products of fibril formation of the αSyn variants considered in this work. MMH (A), MHH (B), MHM (C), MMM (D), HMH (E), HMM (F), HHH (G) and HHM (H) are shown in each panel. The scale bar is 200 nm."

This paragraph also does not contain any information related to mutations.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
The next paragraph to analyze is:
"Fluorescence kinetic analysis of αSyn and its variants. (A) The ratio of apparent growth rates of αSyn variants over that of human αSyn (HHH). (B) Schematic representation of variant sequences in the order of the slowest to the fastest growtu rates."

This paragraph does not contain any information related to mutations.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
The next paragraph to analyze is:
"Factorial design analysis of the effect of A53T and S87N on the lag time of aSyn variants XMH and XHH with X=H and M. The brackets indicate the differences in the lag times of XM with X=M and H and XHH with X=M and H."

This paragraph contains information related to mutations.

**Extracted Information:**

```json

            },
            "Description in input context": "A53T and S87N"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "87"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "S",
                "alt": "N",
                "position": "87"
            },
            "Description in input context": "A53T and S87N"
        }
    ]
}
```

The output format is in JSON, as requested.
