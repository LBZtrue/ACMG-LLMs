Based on the provided text, I will analyze each paragraph to extract information related to mutations.

**Paragraph 1:** "The awakening of alpha-synuclein." - This paragraph does not mention any mutation-related terms or descriptions. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 2:** "Effect of vesicle size on their interaction with class A amphipathic helical peptides." - This paragraph does not mention any mutation-related terms or descriptions. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 3:** "Low-angle X-ray diffraction." - This paragraph mentions "class A amphipathic helical peptides," but it does not mention any mutation-related terms or descriptions. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 4:** "An amphipathic alpha-helix at a membrane interface: a structural study using a novel X-ray diffraction method." - This paragraph mentions "class A amphipathic helical peptides," but it does not mention any mutation-related terms or descriptions. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 5:** "Determination of the secondary structures of proteins by circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion." - This paragraph does not mention any mutation-related terms or descriptions. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 6:** "A simplification of the protein assay method of Lowry et al. which is more generally applicable." - This paragraph does not mention any mutation-related terms or descriptions. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 7:** "Hydration forces." - This paragraph mentions "amphipathic helical peptides," but it does not mention any mutation-related terms or descriptions. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 8:** "Familial Parkinson's disease." - This paragraph mentions "alpha-synuclein," which is a gene associated with mutations. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 9:** "The non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein/alpha-synuclein." - This paragraph mentions "alpha-synuclein," which is a gene associated with mutations. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 10:** "The synucleins: a family of proteins involved in synaptic function, plasticity, neurodegeneration and disease." - This paragraph mentions "alpha-synuclein," which is a gene associated with mutations. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 11:** "Synucleins in synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative disorders." - This paragraph mentions "alpha-synuclein," which is a gene associated with mutations. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```

**Paragraph 12:** "Effect of Parkinson's disease-linked mutations." - This paragraph mentions "Parkinson's disease-linked mutations," which are related to alpha-synuclein gene. Therefore, the output is:

```
{
  "Gene": "SNCA",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "N.D."
}
```
