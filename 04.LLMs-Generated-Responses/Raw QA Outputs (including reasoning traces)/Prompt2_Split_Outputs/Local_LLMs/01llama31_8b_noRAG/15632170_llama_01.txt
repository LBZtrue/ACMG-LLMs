Based on the provided text, it appears to be a medical literature article discussing mutations in the alpha-synuclein protein. However, since the input format is specified as a paragraph of medical literature and the task requires extracting specific mutation information, I will provide an answer based on the given example.

Input Text:
The E46K Mutation in α-Synuclein Increases Amyloid Fibril Formation

Extracted Information:

```json
{
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "E46K",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "E46K",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "The E46K Mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

* Gene: SNCA, as it is the gene associated with alpha-synuclein protein.
* variants:
	+ cDNA Change: The mutation E46K was mentioned directly, but the transcript reference (ref) and alternate base (alt) are not explicitly stated. Therefore, I've used "N.D." to indicate that this information is not provided in the text.
	+ Protein Change: Similar to the cDNA change, the protein change is also described as E46K, with no specific references or positions mentioned. Again, "N.D." is used for these fields.
	+ Description in input context: This field simply repeats the mutation description from the input text.

Please note that this extraction assumes a basic understanding of genetic notation and protein changes. If you require further clarification or have any questions about the extracted information, please let me know!
