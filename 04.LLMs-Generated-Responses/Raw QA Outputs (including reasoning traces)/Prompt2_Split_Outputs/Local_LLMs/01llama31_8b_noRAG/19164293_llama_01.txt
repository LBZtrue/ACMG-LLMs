To address the problem, I will carefully analyze the provided text paragraph to identify whether it contains information related to mutations. If mutation information is found, I will extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

After examining the text paragraph:

"Effect of A30P Mutation on Fibrillization of -Synuclein MARCH 20, 2009•VOLUME 284•NUMBER 12 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 7949 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 101, 16466–16471"

I found the following mutation-related information:

* Gene: SNCA (-Synuclein)
* cDNA Change: N.D.
* Protein Change: A30P
* Description in input context: The text discusses the effect of the A30P mutation on fibrillization of -synuclein.

Since no other mutation-related information is present, I will supplement with "N.D." for content not mentioned.

The extracted information is as follows:

```json
{
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Description in input context": "The A30P mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: The extracted information only includes the A30P mutation, as it is the only mutation-related detail present in the text paragraph.
