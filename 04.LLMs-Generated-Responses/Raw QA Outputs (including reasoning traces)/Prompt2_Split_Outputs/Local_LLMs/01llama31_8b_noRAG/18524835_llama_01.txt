To address the problem, I will follow the specified workflow to carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

Input Text Paragraph:
"A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson's disease. His mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed a coexistence of mutations in the ND6 subunit and the PINK1 gene."

Step 1: Carefully read the input text paragraph to identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

The input text paragraph mentions "mitochondrial DNA," "ND6 subunit," and "PINK1 gene," which are related to mutations. Therefore, I will proceed with extracting specific information.

Step 2: If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

From the input text paragraph:

* Gene name: ND6 (subunit) and PINK1
* variants:
	+ ND6 subunit:
		- No explicit cDNA change description is given for the ND6 subunit. Therefore, I will indicate "N.D." in the extracted information.
		- Protein change: N.D.
		- Description in input context: coexistence of mutations in the ND6 subunit
	+ PINK1 gene:
		- No explicit cDNA change description is given for the PINK1 gene. Therefore, I will indicate "N.D." in the extracted information.
		- Protein change: N.D.
		- Description in input context: coexistence of mutations in the PINK1 gene

Step 3: For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": [
        {
            "name": "ND6"
        },
        {
            "name": "PINK1"
        }
    ],
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "coexistence of mutations in the ND6 subunit"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "coexistence of mutations in the PINK1 gene"
        }
    ]
}
```

The final answer is: 

```json
{
    "Gene": [
        {
            "name": "ND6"
        },
        {
            "name": "PINK1"
        }
    ],
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",

                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "coexistence of mutations in the ND6 subunit"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "coexistence of mutations in the PINK1 gene"
        }
    ]
