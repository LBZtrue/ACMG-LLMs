To answer the question, I will carefully read the input text paragraph and extract relevant information related to mutations.

Input Text Paragraph:
"Zhang et al. reported that a mutation in the E46K gene is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). The mutation is characterized by the substitution of arginine for glutamic acid at position 46 (E46K). Studies have shown that this mutation leads to an increased risk of PD."

Extracted Information:

```json
{
    "Gene": "E46K",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "E",
                "alt": "R",
                "position": "46"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "Glu",
                "alt": "Arg",
                "position": "46"
            },
            "Description in input context": "E46K mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

This extracted information includes the gene name, a description of the mutation (E46K), and details about the cDNA and protein changes. Since the input text does not provide specific information about the transcript, I supplemented that with "N.D." to meet the format requirements.
