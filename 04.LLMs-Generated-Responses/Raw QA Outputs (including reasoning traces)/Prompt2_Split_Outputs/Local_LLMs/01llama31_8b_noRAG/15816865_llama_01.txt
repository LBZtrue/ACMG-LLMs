To extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text, I will carefully read and analyze the paragraph to identify relevant terms and descriptions.

The input text paragraph is:

"Parkin mutations promote its aggregation"

After analyzing the paragraph, I did not find any specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, or mutation descriptions related to mutations. Therefore, I will return "N.D." for each of these fields in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "N.D."
    }
  ]
}
```
