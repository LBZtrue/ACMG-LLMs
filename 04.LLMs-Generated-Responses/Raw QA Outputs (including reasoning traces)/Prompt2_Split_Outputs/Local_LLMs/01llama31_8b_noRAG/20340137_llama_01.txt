**Input Text Paragraph**

The paragraph from the medical literature is:

"The c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

**Extracted Information**

```json
{
  "Gene": "TP53",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A",
        "position": "248"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "D",
        "position": "83"
      },
      "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Explanation**

The extracted information includes the gene name ("TP53"), a single variant with its cDNA change, protein change, and description in the input context. The transcript field is marked as "N.D." since it was not mentioned in the input text.
