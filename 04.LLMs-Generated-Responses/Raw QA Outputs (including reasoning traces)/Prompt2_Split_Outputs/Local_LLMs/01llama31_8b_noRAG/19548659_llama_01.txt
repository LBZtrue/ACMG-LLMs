To solve this problem, I'll follow the provided workflow and extract mutation information from the given text paragraph.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
"In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

**Step 1:** Identify whether the input text paragraph contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

The input text mentions "mutation" and includes specific details about the mutation's location within a gene, making it clear that this paragraph does contain mutation information.

**Step 2:** Extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions from the input text.

From the given text:

* Gene: TP53
* variants:
	+ cDNA Change:
		- transcript: N.D. (not directly mentioned in the text; however, based on standard notation, we can infer it's a genomic sequence)
		- ref: G (the reference nucleotide)
		- alt: A (the alternative nucleotide)
		- position: 248
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: G (the reference amino acid)
		- alt: D (the alternative amino acid)
		- position: 83
	+ Description in input context: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**Step 3:** For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.

Since we were able to extract all required details from the text, there's no need for further supplementation.

**Output in JSON Format:**
```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
