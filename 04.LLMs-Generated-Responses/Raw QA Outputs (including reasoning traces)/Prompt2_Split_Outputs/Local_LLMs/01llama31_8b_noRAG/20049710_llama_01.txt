To answer this question, I will extract the information related to mutations from the provided medical literature and format it according to the specified JSON structure.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
"The c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with recessive parkinsonism."

**Extracted Information:**

```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```

In this extracted information, the Gene is TP53, and there is one variant with a cDNA Change of c.248G>A, a Protein Change of p.G83D, and a Description in the input context of c.248G>A (p.G83D).
