To solve this problem, I will follow the specified workflow and extract mutation information from the given text paragraphs.

**Input Text Paragraph 1:** 
"The Parkinson's disease protein alpha-synuclein disrupts cellular Rab homeostasis. The Parkinson's disease protein alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is a key player in neurodegeneration, and its aggregation has been implicated in several neurological disorders. Recent studies have shown that α-Syn can interact with various biological membranes, leading to changes in membrane fluidity and integrity."

**Step 1:** Carefully read the input text paragraph to identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

The text mentions "Parkinson's disease protein alpha-synuclein", but there is no specific mention of mutations. Therefore, I will return "N.D." for this paragraph.

**Output:**
```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "N.D."
        }
    ]
}
```

**Input Text Paragraph 2:** 
"In a study of Parkinson's disease, it was found that the A30P mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene is associated with neuronal loss."

**Step 1:** Carefully read the input text paragraph to identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

The text mentions "A30P mutation" which indicates a specific mutation. Therefore, I will extract relevant details.

**Step 2:** Extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

From the text, we can extract the following information:

* Gene: alpha-synuclein
* variants:
    + cDNA Change:
        - transcript: N.D.
        - ref: A
        - alt: P
        - position: 30
    + Protein Change:
        - ref: A
        - alt: P
        - position: 30
    + Description in input context: "A30P mutation"

**Output:**
```json
{
    "Gene": "alpha-synuclein",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Description in input context": "A30P mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Input Text Paragraph 3:** 
"A study on Parkinson's disease patients found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

**Step 1:** Carefully read the input text paragraph to identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

The text mentions "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" which indicates a specific mutation in the TP53 gene. Therefore, I will extract relevant details.

**Step 2:** Extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

From the text, we can extract the following information:

* Gene: TP53
* variants:
    + cDNA Change:
        - transcript: N.D.
        - ref: G
        - alt: A
        - position: 248
    + Protein Change:
        - ref: G
        - alt: D
        - position: 83
    + Description in input context: "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"

**Output:**
```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```
