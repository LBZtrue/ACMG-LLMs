To answer the question, I will carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

The input text paragraph is:

"Figure 5. Distinct susceptibility of wild-type and mutated DJ-1 to proteolysis by caspases (A) Localization and nature of the three different pathogenic point mutations on DJ-1. DJ-1 mutants harboring one (60DJ, 149DJ and 166DJ), two (60/149DJ, 60/166DJ and 149/166DJ) or three (tmutDJ) mutations (for nomenclature see table 1 in supplementary materials) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis as described in the “Experimental procedure” (A, alanine; D, aspartic acid; L, leucine; P, proline)."

After reading the input text paragraph, I have identified that it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.

Here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "60"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "60DJ mutation"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "149"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "L",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "149DJ mutation"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "166"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "P",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "166DJ mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that some of the fields are labeled as "N.D." because they were not explicitly mentioned in the input text paragraph.
