Here is the code for a Python script that performs mutation information extraction from medical literature text:

```python
import json
import re

def extract_mutation_info(text):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store extracted information
    info = {
        "Gene": "N.D.",
        "variants": []
    }

    # Identify gene names using regular expressions
    genes = re.findall(r'\b([A-Z][a-z]+[A-Z])(?:\s*\([^)]+\))?\b', text)
    
    if len(genes) > 0:
        info["Gene"] = genes[0]

        # Extract variants information
        variants_info = re.search(r'c\.(\d+)G>\?([AGCT])\?A\?>([AGCT])\?([AGCT])(?:\(p\.([A-Z][a-z]+[A-Z]))?\)', text)
        
        if variants_info:
            variant = {
                "cDNA Change": {
                    "transcript": "N.D.",
                    "ref": variants_info.group(1),
                    "alt": variants_info.group(3),
                    "position": variants_info.group(2)
                },
                "Protein Change": {
                    "ref": "N.D.",
                    "alt": variants_info.group(4),
                    "position": variants_info.group(5)
                },
                "Description in input context": variants_info.group(0)
            }
            
            info["variants"].append(variant)

    return json.dumps(info, indent=4)


# Test the function with example 1
text = "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."
print(extract_mutation_info(text))
```

When you run this script and provide a text paragraph as input, it will output extracted information related to mutations in JSON format.

**Note:** 
- The code uses regular expressions to identify gene names and variant descriptions. This might not cover all possible mutation descriptions or gene names.
- If the text does not contain any mutation-related terms or descriptions, the function will return "N.D." for missing fields.
- This script assumes that cDNA change information is presented in a specific format (e.g., `c.XXXX>XXXX`). Adjust regular expressions to match your specific input formats.
