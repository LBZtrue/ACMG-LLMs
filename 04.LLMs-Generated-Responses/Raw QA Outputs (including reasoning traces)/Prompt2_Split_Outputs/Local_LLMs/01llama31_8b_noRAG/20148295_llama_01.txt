To address the user's requirements, I will extract the mutation information from the provided text paragraph and return it in the specified JSON format.

**Input Text Paragraph:**
```
"Wildtype and mutant αSyn degradation by the 20S proteasome in vitro. Top panel: αSyn proteins were incubated with purified latent 20S proteasome for the times indicated (in minutes). Bottom panel: 20S degradation of αSyn proteins was carried out in the presence of 25 μM liposomes. For both panels, MG indicates reactions that were performed with 20S proteasome that had been preincubated with the inhibitor MG132. Specific N-terminal fragments were produced in a time-dependent manner and were identified by mass spectrometry (1–110, white triangle; 1–83, gray triangle; and 1–73, black triangle)"
```

**Mutation Information Extraction:**
The input text paragraph does not directly mention specific mutations or gene names. However, it mentions αSyn (α-Synuclein) protein degradation by the 20S proteasome in vitro.

Since there is no mutation information provided, I will use "N.D." to supplement the missing content and return an empty JSON object with a message indicating that no mutation information was found.

**JSON Output:**
```json
{
    "Message": "No mutation information found",
    "Mutation Information": {
        "Gene": "N.D.",
        "variants": [],
        "Protein Changes": []
    }
}
```

Please note that this output is based on the input text paragraph provided. If you have a different paragraph or require further clarification, please let me know!
