To solve this task, I will follow the specified workflow and carefully analyze the input text paragraph to extract relevant mutation information.

Input Text Paragraph:
"The c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

Step 1: Identify whether the input text contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
The input text mentions a specific mutation ("c.248G>A (p.G83D)") and its association with a particular gene ("TP53"), which indicates that it contains mutation-related information.

Step 2: Extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.

* Gene: TP53
* variants:
	+ cDNA Change:
		- transcript: N.D. (Not Determined)
		- ref: G
		- alt: A
		- position: 248
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: G
		- alt: D
		- position: 83
	+ Description in input context: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

The extracted information matches the required JSON format, so I will return it as follows:

```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```
