Based on the provided text, I will extract information related to mutations and format it according to the specified JSON output.

**Input Text Paragraph**

The input text paragraph is not explicitly provided in the question. However, I can demonstrate the extraction process using a snippet of text from the provided medical literature examples:

"The R1441C mutation in LRRK2 impairs dopaminergic neurotransmission in mice."

**Extracted Information**

Based on this snippet, the extracted information is as follows:

```json
{
  "Gene": "LRRK2",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "C",
        "position": "1441"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "R",
        "alt": "C",
        "position": "1441"
      },
      "Description in input context": "R1441C mutation"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Explanation**

The extracted information includes:

- **Gene**: The gene name associated with the mutation, which is "LRRK2" in this case.
- **variants**: An array containing a single object representing the mutation variant.
- **cDNA Change**: The cDNA change associated with the mutation, including:
  - **transcript**: Not mentioned (indicated by "N.D.").
  - **ref**: Not mentioned (indicated by "N.D.").
  - **alt**: The alternative nucleotide ("C").
  - **position**: The position of the mutation ("1441").
- **Protein Change**: The protein change associated with the mutation, including:
  - **ref**: The reference amino acid ("R").
  - **alt**: The alternative amino acid ("C").
  - **position**: The position of the mutation ("1441").
- **Description in input context**: A brief description of the mutation as mentioned in the input text.

The output is formatted according to the specified JSON structure, with "N.D." used where information was not explicitly mentioned.
