To determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations and extract relevant details, I will carefully read the paragraph and use my expertise in medical literature data mining.

The input text paragraph is:

"The ring between ring fingers (RBR) protein family."

After analyzing the paragraph, I found that it does not contain information related to specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, or mutation descriptions. However, I did identify some terms that might be relevant in the context of mutations.

Here's my attempt to extract relevant details:

```json
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [],
  "Description in input context": "The ring between ring fingers (RBR) protein family"
}
```

As I did not find any specific gene names, cDNA changes, or mutation descriptions, I used "N.D." to indicate that the information is not mentioned.
