To answer the question, I will follow the specified workflow and extract relevant mutation information from the provided medical literature text.

**Text Analysis:**
The input text paragraph is as follows:

"The L166P mutant DJ-1 protein associated with early onset Parkinson's disease is unstable and forms higher-order protein complexes."

From this analysis, it appears that the text discusses a specific mutation, "L166P", in the gene encoding the DJ-1 protein.

**Mutation Information Extraction:**

* **Gene:** DJ-1
* **variants:**
	+ "cDNA Change": The cDNA change is not explicitly mentioned. Since this information is not provided, we will indicate it as "N.D."
	+ "Protein Change": The protein change is mentioned as "L166P".
	+ "Description in input context": The mutation description is given as "L166P mutant DJ-1 protein associated with early onset Parkinson's disease".

The extracted information in JSON format:

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "L",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "166"
            },
            "Description in input context": "L166P mutant DJ-1 protein associated with early onset Parkinson's disease"
        }
    ]
}
```

Please note that the cDNA change details are not provided, so we indicate them as "N.D." according to the constraints.
