First, I'm an expert at analyzing literature data and must respond strictly based on what's explicitly stated. No fabricating or speculating – only use information from the given text.

The input is a context paragraph about AR-JP and parkin gene mutations. Let me read it carefully:

"Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP), one of the most common familial forms of Parkinson disease, is characterized by selective dopaminergic neural cell death and the absence of the Lewy body... We previously cloned PARK2, mutations of which cause AR-JP... but the function of the gene product, parkin, remains unknown. We report here that parkin is involved in protein degradation as a ubiquitin-protein ligase collaborating with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7, and that mutant parkins from AR-JP patients show loss of the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity... Our findings indicate that accumulation of proteins that have yet to be identified causes a selective neural cell death without formation of Lewy bodies. Our findings should enhance the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases..."

Now, I need to determine if this contains mutation-related information and extract it.

From my background, I'm looking for:

- Gene names

- cDNA changes (e.g., specific mutations like c.248G>A)

- Protein changes (e.g., p.Glu16Arg or something similar)

- Mutation descriptions

In the text, there are mentions of mutations in PARK2 gene causing AR-JP, and mutant parkins show loss of activity.

Specific phrases:

- "We previously cloned PARK2, mutations of which cause AR-JP"

This indicates that mutations in PARK2 are associated with AR-JP. But it doesn't specify any particular mutation (no cDNA or protein changes given).

- "mutant parkins from AR-JP patients show loss of the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity"

Again, this talks about mutant parkin proteins but doesn't detail any specific mutations in terms of nucleotide or amino acid changes.

The output format requires:

{
    "Gene": "Gene name",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",  // If not specified
                "ref": "",
                "alt": "",
                "position": ""
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "",
                "alt": "",
                "position": ""
            },
            "Description in input context": "Description string"
        }
    ]
}

I need to extract gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

In this paragraph:

- Gene: PARK2

- Variants: It says mutations cause AR-JP, but no specific variant is mentioned. The mutation description is that mutant parkins show loss of activity, but still not a specific change.

From the text:

- "mutations of which cause AR-JP" – This implies general mutations in PARK2 leading to AR-JP, but doesn't specify any particular one.

- No cDNA or protein change details are given. For example, no sequence like c.XXX>Y or p.AAA>BBB is mentioned.

In the "Description in input context", it should be a string that describes the mutation as found in the text.

But looking at the examples:

Example 1 has specific changes: cDNA Change with position, ref, alt; Protein Change with position, ref, alt; and Description matches that.

Here, no specific positions or changes are given. It's more general.

I also have to use "N.D." for fields not mentioned.

The gene is PARK2.

For variants, I need to list them in an array.

Since only one gene is mentioned (PARK2), but the mutation is associated with AR-JP patients generally.

Let me check if there are any specific mutations described.

- "We report here that parkin is involved... and mutant parkins show loss of activity."

But no details like location or type of mutation. It's inferred, not explicit.

The constraints say: "Extract only information directly related to mutations", and in the output format, I have to ensure completeness.

In this case:

- Gene: PARK2

- variants: There is at least one variant implied by "mutations" causing AR-JP.

But for each variant, I need cDNA Change and Protein Change.

Since no specific changes are mentioned, all those fields should be N.D. or empty?

Looking at the JSON structure in examples:

"cDNA Change" has a transcript field that can be "N.D." if not specified.

Similarly, protein change might have ref and alt as strings or something, but in example it's { "ref": "G", "alt": "D", "position": "83" }, so I need to provide the amino acid changes if mentioned.

But here, no specific mutation is described; just that mutations exist and cause AR-JP.

Also, "mutant parkins from AR-JP patients show loss of the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity."

This might be a description in context, but it's not specifying any particular variant change.

I think I need to extract what's there.

Perhaps I can have one entry for the mutation association.

Gene: PARK2

variants: [{ "Description": "... mutations cause AR-JP" }]

But the JSON specifies cDNA Change and Protein Change with specific fields.

cDNA Change should have position, ref, alt – all N.D. here because not specified.

Protein Change similarly.

Then Description in input context could be something like "Mutations in PARK2 gene cause AR-JP."

But let's see if there are more details.

The text says: "mutations of which cause AR-JP" and later "mutant parkins from AR-JP patients show loss..."

No specific mutation data, just that mutations exist and lead to loss of function.

For the variant array, I might need to list it as one or more variants without specifics.

But in the example, there's a specific change given.

I should follow the format strictly.

If no cDNA or protein changes are mentioned, set those fields to N.D. or appropriate values.

Output Format:

- Gene: string

- variants: array of objects, each with "cDNA Change" and "Protein Change"

"cDNA Change": { "transcript": "", "ref": "", "alt": "", "position": "" } – but in the example, transcript is set to N.D. if not present.

"N.D." means Not Determined or information not mentioned.

In this paragraph:

- Gene: PARK2

- Variants: Mutations are associated with AR-JP causing loss of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity.

So for variants, I can have one entry with description "Mutations cause AR-JP and show loss of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity."

But let's break it down.

Perhaps:

Gene: "PARK2"

variants: [ {
    "cDNA Change": { 
        "transcript": "N.D.",  // No transcript specified
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."   // Or should it be a string? In example, position is number if known.
    },
    "Protein Change": { 
        "ref": "N.D.", 
        "alt": "N.D.", 
        "position": "N.D."  // No specific amino acid change mentioned
    },
    "Description in input context": "Mutations cause AR-JP and mutant parkins show loss of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity"
} ]

But is the gene name correctly capitalized? In literature, PARK2 might be written with capital P or not. Typically genes are upper case.

In the text: "PARK2" – it's probably referring to the gene symbol as in databases.

Also, there's no specific transcript ID mentioned; just general mutations.

Another part: "collaborating with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7"

But that's not a mutation-specific detail.

The goal is to extract mutation-related information.

Since it says "mutations of which cause AR-JP", and doesn't specify any changes, I should still return something indicating there are mutations in PARK2 associated with AR-JP.

Perhaps the description can capture that.

Let me look at the example again.

In Example 1: Input has specific cDNA and protein changes.

Here, no specifics, so most fields N.D. except gene and general description.

But the output format requires "variants" array, which might imply multiple or one variant entry.

I think I should have an array with one object if there's at least one mutation mentioned indirectly.

To be precise:

- Gene: PARK2

- variants: [{
    "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",  // Not specified
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
    },
    "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
    },
    "Description in input context": "Mutations cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism and are associated with loss of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity"
}]

But is the description accurate? Let's quote from text.

"mutations of which cause AR-JP"

and

"mutant parkins from AR-JP patients show loss..."

No specific protein change, just loss of function.

Also, in the abstract, it says "ref. 2", but I think that's a citation, not part of extraction unless specified.

The workflow: If mutation information is found, extract relevant details; if not, N.D.

Mutation information is mentioned implicitly.

I should check for direct mentions.

Another thing: The gene product is parkin, which comes from PARK2 gene. Mutations in the gene cause AR-JP and lead to loss of function.

But no specific sequence changes are given, only that mutations exist.

In data mining, this might be sufficient to say there are mutations without detailing them.

The output format seems designed for specific mutations, but can handle N.D. cases.

In Example 1, when a change is specified, it's detailed; otherwise, perhaps use "N.D." appropriately.

Perhaps I need to extract only if explicit changes are mentioned.

But the background says: "identify whether the literature contains information related to mutations" and "extract relevant details".

So even without specific positions, just knowing there are mutations might be part of it.

Let's see what is directly stated:

- Mutations in PARK2 cause AR-JP.

- No cDNA or protein changes specified.

Also, "accumulation of proteins that have yet to be identified" but that's not about the mutation itself; it's a consequence.

I think I should return:

Gene: "PARK2"

variants: [{  // Since no specific variants are listed, perhaps just one with general description

    "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
    },
    "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
    },
    "Description in input context": "Mutations cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism"

}]

The second part: mutant parkins show loss of activity, but this is more about the function than a specific mutation change.

I could include that in description.

But to keep it simple, perhaps stick to what's directly tied to mutations causing AR-JP.

Now, for the JSON structure, I need to ensure all fields are present. If N.D., use "N.D." or appropriate values.

In cDNA Change: transcript should be a string, probably set to an empty string or "N.D." if not mentioned.

Similarly for others.

Also, in Example 1, description is exactly the mutation notation from input.

Here, it's similar but more descriptive.

Perhaps I can use a concise description.

Let me formulate the output.
