Okay, let's see. The user provided a context from a Science article with DOI 10.1126/science.1096284, titled "Hereditary Early-Onset Parkinson's Disease Caused by Mutations in PINK1" by Enza Maria Valente et al. The question is about extracting mutation information from the text.

First, I need to check the input text for any mention of mutations. The title itself says "Hereditary Early-Onset Parkinson's Disease Caused by Mutations in PINK1," which directly mentions mutations in the PINK1 gene. However, the actual text provided in the context doesn't include specific details about the mutations, such as cDNA changes, protein changes, or descriptions beyond the gene name. 

Looking through the text, the user's context includes some unrelated information about resistin and adiponectin, which seems to be from a different study. But the main article here is about PINK1 mutations causing Parkinson's. However, in the given context, there's no specific mutation details like nucleotide changes or protein alterations. The user's example shows how to extract cDNA and protein changes, but in this case, the context doesn't provide those specifics. 

The constraints say to use "N.D." for missing information. So, even though the gene is mentioned, the variants and their details are not present in the provided text. Therefore, the answer should list the gene as PINK1, but the variants array would have entries with all fields as "N.D." since there's no specific mutation data in the given context.
