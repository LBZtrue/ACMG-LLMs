Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to scan through the abstract and introduction sections to find any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions E46K, A30P, and A53T mutations in the αS gene. These are all missense mutations. The article also refers to the A30P/A53T double mutation. The introduction section repeats these mutations and adds some references to the literature, like Polymeropoulos et al., 1997 for A53T, Kruger et al., 1998 for A30P, and Zarranz et al., 2004 for E46K. There's also a mention of multiplication of the gene, but that's not a point mutation, so maybe not relevant here.

Now, I need to structure the JSON according to the example. The gene is α-synuclein, which is also referred to as αS. The variants should include each mutation. Each variant has a cDNA change and protein change. However, the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA positions, only the amino acid changes. So for cDNA change, I'll put "N.D." for transcript, ref, alt, and position. The protein change will have the reference and alternate amino acids and their positions. The description in the input context is the mutation name as mentioned, like E46K, etc.

Wait, the example uses "c.248G>A" as the cDNA change. But in the given text, the mutations are described as E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T. There's no mention of the exact cDNA positions, so I can't provide those. So the cDNA change fields should all be "N.D.".

Also, there's a double mutation A30P/A53T. Should that be a separate entry? The example shows an array of variants, so maybe each individual mutation and the combination. But the text mentions the A30P/A53T mutation as a separate entry. So I'll include that as a variant with both amino acid changes.

I need to make sure that all fields are filled, using "N.D." where information isn't present. Let me check each part again. The gene is definitely α-synuclein (αS). The variants are E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T. Each has protein changes with positions 46, 30, 53, and both 30 and 53. The cDNA changes are not specified, so "N.D." for all. The description in the input context is the mutation names as given.

I think that's all. Now, structuring the JSON accordingly.
