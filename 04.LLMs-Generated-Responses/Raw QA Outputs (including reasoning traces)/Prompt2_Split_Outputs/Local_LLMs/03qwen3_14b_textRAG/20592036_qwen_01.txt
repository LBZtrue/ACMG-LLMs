Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided literature text. First, I need to read through the text carefully to see if there are any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, the first part talks about α-synuclein (αS) being linked to Parkinson's disease through its deposition in amyloid fibrils and mentions three αS point mutations that cause early-onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism. The term "three αS point mutations" is mentioned, but the specific mutations aren't named here. 

Further down, the study discusses the effects of the three known PD-linked mutations on the conformations of αS. However, the text doesn't list the actual mutations, like specific amino acid changes or gene symbols. The mutations are referred to in general terms as "three known PD-linked mutations" but without details such as their positions or the exact changes.

The user's example shows that when specific mutations are given, like c.248G>A (p.G83D), they should be extracted with gene, cDNA change, protein change, etc. But in this case, the text doesn't provide the specific variants. It only mentions that there are three mutations linked to Parkinson's, but they aren't detailed. 

So, according to the constraints, if the information isn't mentioned, I should use "N.D." for each field. The gene is α-synuclein, but the variants section would have N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, position, and protein change. The description in the input context would be "three αS point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism" as that's the only specific information provided about the mutations.

I need to make sure I don't infer any details that aren't explicitly stated. The text doesn't provide the exact mutations, so I can't assume they are known or list them. Therefore, the correct approach is to extract the gene and the general description of the mutations, leaving the variants as N.D. where specific details are missing.
