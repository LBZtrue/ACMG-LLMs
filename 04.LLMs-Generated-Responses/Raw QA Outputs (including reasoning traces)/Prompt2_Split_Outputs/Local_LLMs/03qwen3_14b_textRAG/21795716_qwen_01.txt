Okay, let's start by looking at the provided text. The user wants me to check if there's any mutation information mentioned here. The title mentions "Mutant A53T -Synuclein," which seems like a mutation. The abstract talks about generating cells expressing DMT1 either singly or with wild type or mutant -synuclein. The mutant here is A53T.

So, the gene involved is SNCA, since -synuclein is also known as alpha-synuclein, and the A53T mutation is a well-known mutation in Parkinson's disease. The cDNA change isn't specified here, but the protein change is A53T. The description in the context refers to the mutant A53T -synuclein.

I need to structure this into the JSON format. The gene is SNCA, variants would include the A53T mutation. The cDNA change is N.D. because it's not mentioned. The protein change has ref as A, alt as T, position 53. The description in the input context is "mutant A53T -synuclein."

I should make sure that all other fields are N.D. where not mentioned. The rest of the text doesn't mention other mutations, so only this one is relevant.
