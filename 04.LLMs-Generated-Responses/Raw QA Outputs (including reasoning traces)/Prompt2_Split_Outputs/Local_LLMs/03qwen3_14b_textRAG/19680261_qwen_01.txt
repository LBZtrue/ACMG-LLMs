Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the given paragraph. The main focus here is on DJ-1 and its mutations related to Parkinson's disease.

First, I'll look for any mention of mutations. In the abstract, there's a mention of two specific mutations: D149A and L166P. The D149A mutation is described as an early-onset PD-associated mutation that makes DJ-1 resistant to caspase-6 proteolysis. The L166P mutation is noted to prevent DJ-1 dimerization but doesn't impair proteolysis by caspase-6, even though it also abolishes the anti-apoptotic function.

Next, I need to map these mutations to the JSON structure. The gene here is DJ-1. Each mutation should be in the variants array. For each variant, I need to check if there's a cDNA change (like a specific exon deletion or nucleotide change), but the text doesn't mention cDNA changes directly. It only refers to protein changes (D149A and L166P). 

The description in the input context should include the mutation's effect as mentioned in the text. For D149A, the description would be "early-onset PD-associated mutation that renders DJ-1 resistant to caspase-6 proteolysis and abolishes its protective phenotype." For L166P, the description is "prevents DJ-1 dimerization and abolishes DJ-1 anti-apoptotic function, but does not impair its proteolysis by caspase-6."

Since the text doesn't provide cDNA changes or transcript information, those fields should be "N.D." Similarly, the protein change for each mutation is the amino acid substitution (D to A at position 149, and L to P at position 166). 

I need to ensure that all fields are filled with either the extracted information or "N.D." as per the constraints. The variants array should list both mutations with their respective details.
