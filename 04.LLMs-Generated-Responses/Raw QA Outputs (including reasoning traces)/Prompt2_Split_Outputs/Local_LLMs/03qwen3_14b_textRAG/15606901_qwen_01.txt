Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to scan through the text to find any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the abstract and the sections, the main discussion is about parkin mutations. The study characterizes C-terminal and N-terminal mutants. The C-terminal deletion is mentioned, which affects membrane association and causes misfolding. Then there are four N-terminal missense mutations in the UBL domain. The paper also mentions a 42 kDa parkin species from an internal start site lacking the UBL domain.

I need to check if these are specific mutations. The C-terminal deletion is a deletion, but the exact position isn't given. The N-terminal missense mutations are four in the UBL domain, but the specific amino acid changes aren't detailed. The 42 kDa variant is described as originating from an internal start site, but no specific cDNA changes are provided.

The user's example shows that if the mutation details are not present, I should use "N.D." So for the C-terminal deletion, since the exact position isn't mentioned, I'll use N.D. for the cDNA and protein changes. Similarly, the N-terminal missense mutations are four, but without specific positions or amino acid changes, they'll be N.D. in the variants.

The 42 kDa parkin is a different species, but it's not a mutation per se, more like an alternative splice or different isoform. The question is about mutations, so maybe that's not relevant. However, the text mentions that this variant lacks the N-terminal UBL domain, which could be a structural change, but again, no specific mutation details are given.

So, the main mutations are the C-terminal deletion and the four N-terminal missense in the UBL. But without specific cDNA positions or protein changes, the variants would have N.D. entries. The gene is clearly parkin. The description in the input context would be the phrases from the text about the deletions and missense mutations.
