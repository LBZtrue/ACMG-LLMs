Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature. First, I need to scan through the text to find any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, the first mention is "Deletion and point (L166P) mutations of DJ-1 have recently been shown to be responsible for the onset of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD, PARK7)." Here, the gene is DJ-1, and the mutation is L166P. That's a point mutation, which I know refers to a single nucleotide change leading to an amino acid substitution. The position is 166, changing from Leucine (L) to Proline (P). 

Then later, it says "cells harbouring mutant forms of DJ-1, including L166P, became susceptible to death..." which reinforces that L166P is a specific mutation. 

I need to check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The text also mentions "Deletion and point (L166P) mutations" again, but that's the same information. There's no other mutation listed, like another amino acid change or different positions. 

So, the gene is DJ-1. The variant is L166P. The cDNA change isn't specified here, only the protein change. Since the user's example included cDNA changes even if they were N.D., I should check if the text provides that. However, in the given text, there's no mention of the specific cDNA position or transcript. The mutation is described at the protein level as L166P. 

Therefore, the cDNA change would be N.D., and the protein change is L to P at position 166. The description in the context is "Deletion and point (L166P) mutations of DJ-1" and "mutant forms of DJ-1, including L166P". 

I need to make sure I don't miss any other mutations. Scanning again, I don't see any other variants. The rest of the text talks about the role of DJ-1 in antioxidative stress and cell death, but no other mutations. 

So the final JSON should have Gene: DJ-1, variants with cDNA Change as N.D. and Protein Change with ref L, alt P, position 166, and the description as mentioned.
