Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraph. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

Looking at the abstract and the main content, the article discusses mutations in the parkin gene linked to Parkinson's disease. The key points mention that many disease-linked point mutants of parkin retain catalytic activity. However, the focus is on how these mutations affect solubility and intracellular localization, leading to protein aggregation. 

Now, the user's task is to identify if there are specific mutations mentioned. The abstract and the text talk about "parkin point mutants" and "missense/nonsense mutations," but they don't list specific mutations with cDNA changes or protein alterations. The examples given in the user's instructions include specific mutations like c.248G>A (p.G83D), but in this text, there's no such detailed information. 

The text mentions "22 in total" parkin point mutants analyzed, but it doesn't provide the exact cDNA positions, amino acid changes, or specific variant descriptions. The focus is more on the effects of these mutations rather than their exact molecular changes. 

Therefore, since the literature doesn't specify individual mutations with cDNA or protein changes, I should return "N.D." for those fields. The gene is clearly parkin, and the variants are described as point mutants, but without specific details, the other fields remain N.D.
