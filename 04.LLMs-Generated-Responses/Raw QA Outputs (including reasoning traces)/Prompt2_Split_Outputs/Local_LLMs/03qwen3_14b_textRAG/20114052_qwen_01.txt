Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants to extract mutation information from the given paragraph. The main focus here is on α-synuclein and its mutations related to Parkinson's disease.

First, I need to identify any mentions of mutations. The text mentions the E46K mutant of α-synuclein, which is linked to a familial form of Parkinson's disease. That's a clear mutation. The E46K notation refers to a substitution at position 46, where glutamic acid (E) is replaced by lysine (K). 

Looking at the structure of the JSON example provided, I need to extract the gene name, which here is α-synuclein. The variants section should include the cDNA change and protein change. However, the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position or transcript, so those fields should be "N.D.".

The protein change is E46K, so the reference amino acid is E (glutamic acid), the alternate is K (lysine), and the position is 46. The description in the context is "E46K" and it's linked to a familial form of PD.

I should also check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The text talks about alanine substitutions of Lys34 and Tyr39 in synthetic GBD peptides, but those are part of the study's experimental manipulations, not naturally occurring mutations. So they shouldn't be included here.

So, the extracted information would include the gene α-synuclein, the variant E46K with the corresponding protein change, and the description linking it to familial PD. The cDNA change details are not provided, so they remain as N.D.
