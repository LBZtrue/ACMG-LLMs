Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to check if there's any mutation information mentioned here. The context is about a-synuclein and Parkinson's disease.

Looking at the first paragraph, it mentions that a-synuclein is linked to Parkinson's disease and that single point mutations and gene duplications/triplications are causally linked to early-onset familial PD. The DOI is 10.1002/anie.201000378, and the title refers to a mutation altering the folding landscape. However, the text doesn't specify the exact mutation, like the gene name, cDNA change, or protein change. It just states that mutations are associated with the disease. 

The example given in the user's instructions includes specific details like gene names and cDNA changes. Here, the literature only mentions that mutations exist but doesn't provide the specific details. So, according to the constraints, I should return "N.D." for the parts that aren't mentioned. The key here is that while the text does mention mutations, it doesn't give the specific variants. Therefore, the Gene, cDNA Change, and Protein Change fields should all be "N.D.".
