Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided text. The text is about a study on alpha-synuclein mutations in Parkinson's disease. First, I need to check if there are any specific mutations mentioned.

Looking at the title, it mentions "A53T mutant isoform of Alpha-Synuclein". That seems like a mutation. The gene here is Alpha-Synuclein, and the mutation is A53T. The A53T notation refers to a substitution at position 53 where alanine (A) is replaced by threonine (T). 

In the abstract, they compare wild-type (WT) and A53T mutant R-syn. The term "A53T" is used multiple times. The introduction also talks about the A53T mutation in alpha-synuclein being associated with PD. 

So the gene is SNCA (since Alpha-Synuclein is also known as SNCA), and the mutation is A53T. The cDNA change isn't specified here, but the protein change is from alanine to threonine at position 53. The description in the context is "A53T mutant isoform".

I need to structure this into the JSON format. The gene is SNCA, variants should include the cDNA change (which is N.D. since not mentioned), protein change with ref A, alt T, position 53. The description is "A53T".

I should make sure not to include any other mutations. The text doesn't mention other mutations, just the A53T one. So the extracted information should only have that. Let me check again to ensure there's no other mutation mentioned. The wild-type is WT, but that's not a mutation. The rest of the text discusses proteins and their changes, but not other mutations. So yes, only A53T.
