Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully to see if there's any mention of mutations. The user is asking specifically about mutations related to Parkinson's disease, so I'll focus on sections that discuss PINK1 and parkin.

In the abstract, it says, "Mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) or parkin cause autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson disease (PD), but how these mutations trigger neurodegeneration is poorly understood..." So here, both PINK1 and parkin are mentioned as having mutations that cause PD. However, the text doesn't specify the exact mutations, like specific nucleotide changes or protein alterations. It just refers to "mutations" in general.

Looking further into the introduction, they mention "homozygous mutations in parkin" and "homozygous mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)" again. They also note "heterozygous mutations in parkin or PINK1" as risk factors for late-onset PD. But again, there are no specific details about the mutations themselves. The text talks about the effects of these mutations (like impaired ability to promote phosphorylation), but not the actual genetic changes.

The rest of the paper discusses the mechanisms involving phosphorylation and signaling pathways, but there's no mention of specific mutations beyond the genes involved. The examples given in the user's instructions include specific cDNA changes and protein changes, but in this text, that level of detail isn't present.

So, based on the information provided, the literature does mention that mutations in PINK1 and parkin are associated with PD, but it doesn't specify the exact mutations. Therefore, the answer should indicate that while mutations are discussed, the specific details are not present in the text.
