Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided text. The text is about Parkinson's disease and mutations in a-synuclein and UCH-L1. 

First, I need to look for any mention of mutations. The abstract mentions "Parkinson’s disease-associated mutations in a-synuclein and UCH-L1". Then, in the results section, they talk about specific mutations like D30K UCH-L1, C90S UCH-L1, and I93M in UCH-L1. Also, there's a mention of Parkinson’s disease-linked a-synuclein mutants.

So, the genes involved are UCH-L1 and a-synuclein. The variants are D30K, C90S, I93M for UCH-L1. For a-synuclein, the text refers to "Parkinson’s disease-linked a-synuclein mutants" but doesn't specify the exact mutations, so I should put N.D. for those. 

The cDNA changes aren't mentioned, so I'll use N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, and position. Protein changes for UCH-L1 are D30K, C90S, I93M. The description in the context is given as "D30K UCH-L1", "C90S UCH-L1", and "I93M in UCH-L1". For a-synuclein, the description is "Parkinson’s disease-linked a-synuclein mutants".

I need to structure this into JSON as per the example. Each variant is an object in the variants array. Make sure to use N.D. where information isn't provided. Check that all fields are included. Also, ensure that the gene names are correct and the mutations are accurately captured.
