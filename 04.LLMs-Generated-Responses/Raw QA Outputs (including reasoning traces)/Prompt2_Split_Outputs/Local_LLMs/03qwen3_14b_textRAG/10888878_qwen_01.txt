Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided text. The text is a scientific article about parkin and its role in Parkinson's disease.

First, I need to check if there are any mentions of mutations. The abstract mentions that mutations in PARK2 cause AR-JP, which is autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. The gene is called PARK2, and the mutations are linked to the disease. However, the text doesn't specify the exact mutations, like nucleotide changes or protein alterations. It just states that mutations in PARK2 are responsible. 

Looking at the example given, when there's a specific mutation like c.248G>A, they extract that. But here, the text only mentions the gene (PARK2) and the disease (AR-JP) without any specific variants. The rest of the text talks about the function of parkin as a ubiquitin-protein ligase and the effect of mutant parkins, but again, no specific mutations are listed. 

So according to the user's instructions, if there's no specific mutation details, I should put "N.D." for the parts not mentioned. The gene is PARK2, and the variants would be N.D. because there are no specific cDNA or protein changes listed. The description in the context is that mutations in PARK2 cause AR-JP. 

I need to make sure I'm not making up any mutations. The text doesn't provide any, so the answer should reflect that. The JSON structure should have the gene as PARK2 and variants with N.D. in all fields.
