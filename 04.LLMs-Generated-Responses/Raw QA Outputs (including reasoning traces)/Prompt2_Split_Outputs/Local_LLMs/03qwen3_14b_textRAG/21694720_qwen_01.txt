Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided text. The text is about Parkin's autoregulation through its ubiquitin-like domain. The main points are that Parkin is an E3-ubiquitin ligase involved in Parkinson's disease, and there's mention of pathogenic Parkin mutations disrupting autoinhibition.

First, I need to check if there are any specific mutations described. The text says "pathogenic Parkin mutations" but doesn't give any specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, or protein changes. It just mentions that mutations exist and their effect on the protein's function. Since there are no specific mutations listed, I should return "N.D." for all the fields. The gene is Parkin, but the variants section would have N.D. because there are no specific mutations mentioned. The description in the input context would be "pathogenic Parkin mutations disrupt this autoinhibition, resulting in a constitutively active molecule." But according to the example, the description should be the exact term from the input. Wait, the example includes the exact mutation notation. Here, the input mentions "pathogenic Parkin mutations" but doesn't specify any particular mutation. So, the variants array should have N.D. for each part. The user's constraints say to use N.D. for content not mentioned. So even though the gene is Parkin, the variants are not specified. Therefore, the answer should have the gene as Parkin and variants as N.D. in all fields.
