Okay, I need to extract mutation information from the given text. Let me read through the abstract carefully.

The first sentence mentions mutations in the N-terminus of the gene encoding α-synuclein (α-syn) linked to autosomal dominant PD. The specific mutation mentioned is A30P. 

So, the gene here is α-synuclein, and the mutation is A30P. The abstract also refers to the mutant A30P α-syn. 

Looking for cDNA changes: the text doesn't mention any specific cDNA changes, like nucleotide positions or transcripts. It just refers to the protein change A30P. 

Protein change: The mutation is A30P, which is a substitution of alanine to proline at position 30. 

Description in the context: The mutation is linked to autosomal dominant PD and is part of the study's focus. 

I need to make sure there's no other mutation mentioned. The rest of the abstract talks about the effects of the mutation but doesn't provide more details on the genetic level beyond A30P. 

So, the extracted information should include the gene as α-synuclein, the protein change A30P, and the description related to PD. Since there's no cDNA information provided, those fields should be N.D.
