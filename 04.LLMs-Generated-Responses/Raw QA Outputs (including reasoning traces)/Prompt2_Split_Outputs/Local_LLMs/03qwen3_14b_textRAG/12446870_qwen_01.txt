Okay, let's see. The user provided a query where they want me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically looking for mutation information in a given text. The example they gave was about TP53 with a specific mutation. Now, the input text they provided is from a Science article about DJ-1 gene mutations associated with early-onset Parkinsonism.

First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations. The title says "Mutations in the DJ-1 Gene Associated with Autosomal Recessive Early-Onset Parkinsonism." So, the gene is DJ-1, and the condition is autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism. The text probably discusses mutations in DJ-1 leading to this disease.

Looking at the content, the abstract mentions that mutations in DJ-1 are associated with the disease. However, the user's example included specific cDNA changes and protein changes, like c.248G>A and p.G83D. In the provided text, there's no mention of specific mutations, only that mutations exist. The rest of the text talks about the role of DNA toroids and Mn2+ effects, which don't relate to mutations.

So, the answer should include the gene DJ-1, and since there are no specific variants mentioned, the variants array would have entries with N.D. for all fields. The description would be "mutations in the DJ-1 gene associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism."

I need to make sure I don't infer any specific mutations that aren't mentioned. The user's constraint is to extract only what's directly stated. The example from the user had a specific mutation, but in this case, the text doesn't provide those details. Therefore, the variants should have N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, position, and protein changes.
