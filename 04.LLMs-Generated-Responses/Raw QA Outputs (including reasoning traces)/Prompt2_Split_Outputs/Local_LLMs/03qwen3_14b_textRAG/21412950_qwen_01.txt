Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

Looking at the abstract and introduction, the main focus is on PINK1's role in Parkinson's disease. They mention that mutations in PINK1 cause recessive familial PD and are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the text doesn't go into specific mutations. It talks about the structure of the gene and some PD-related mutations affecting the protein's function, but there are no specific details like cDNA changes or protein variants.

The keywords section lists terms like "pathogenic mutations," but again, no specific examples are given. The introduction mentions that PINK1 has a kinase domain similar to CaMK, but no mutations are detailed here. The study models the 3D structure and finds some evidence about mutations, but without concrete examples.

Since there's no mention of specific mutations, cDNA changes, or protein alterations, I should check if there's any other part of the text that might have that info. The abstract and introduction don't provide specific variants. The references are cited but not detailed here. 

Therefore, the answer should indicate that no specific mutation details are present. The user's example shows that if no info is found, "N.D." is used. So, the JSON should have "Gene" as "PINK1" and "variants" as an empty array with "N.D." entries.
