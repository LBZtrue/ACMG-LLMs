Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraph. First, I need to carefully read through the abstract and the main text to see if there are any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the abstract, the first sentence mentions "mutations in PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1)" causing an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's disease, PARK6. The term "mutations" is explicitly used here. The gene name is PINK1, and the mutation is linked to PARK6. However, the abstract doesn't specify the type of mutations (like specific nucleotide changes or protein changes), only that there are mutations in PINK1.

Next, the main text discusses PARK6-related mutations but states that these mutations do not affect the dimerization of PINK1. However, there's no detailed information about the specific mutations, such as cDNA changes or protein alterations. The rest of the abstract talks about the effects of mutant PINK1 or knock-down, but again, no specific mutations are listed.

So, the literature mentions that PINK1 mutations are involved in PARK6, but there's no detailed information on the specific variants. Therefore, the gene is PINK1, and the mutation description is linked to PARK6. Since there are no specific cDNA changes or protein changes mentioned, those fields should be "N.D.".
