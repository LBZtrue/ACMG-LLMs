Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraph. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

Looking at the abstract, they mention the A53T a-syn gene mutation in the context of familial Parkinson's disease. The introduction also refers to this mutation. The key terms here are "A53T a-syn gene mutation." 

I need to identify if this is a mutation in a specific gene. The gene is alpha-synuclein, which is often abbreviated as a-syn. The mutation is A53T, which refers to an amino acid change from Alanine to Threonine at position 53. 

Next, I should check if the text provides the cDNA change. The abstract and introduction don't mention the exact cDNA position, only the protein change. So the cDNA change would be "N.D." as per the user's instructions. 

The protein change is clearly stated as A53T. The description in the input context is "A53T a-syn gene mutation." 

I need to make sure there are no other mutations mentioned. The rest of the text talks about tau protein and fibrillization, but no other mutations. 

So, the extracted information should have the gene as "alpha-synuclein" or "a-syn," the variant with cDNA change as N.D., protein change as A53T, and the description as given. 

I should structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring all fields are filled with N.D. where information isn't present. Double-checking the example provided by the user to match the format exactly.
