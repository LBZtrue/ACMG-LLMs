Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information from the given medical literature paragraph. 

First, I need to identify if there are any mentions of mutations. The text starts by talking about mutations in the LRRK2 gene causing Parkinson's disease. The gene is named LRRK2, and the protein is called dardarin. The mutations are mentioned as being found throughout the gene, including the kinase domain. 

Looking for specific mutation details, the text mentions that pathogenic mutations increase inclusion body formation and lead to cell death. However, there are no specific cDNA changes or protein changes like p.G83D mentioned here. The text refers to replacing the kinase domain with a kinase-dead version, but that's more about a modified protein rather than a specific mutation. 

The keywords section lists LRRK2, Kinase, Parkinson’s disease, etc., but again, no specific mutations are detailed. The introduction repeats that LRRK2 mutations are a common cause of PD but doesn't provide specific variants. 

Since there are no specific cDNA changes or protein changes listed, the variants array should have "N.D." for all fields. The gene is clearly LRRK2, but the variants are not detailed. The description in the context mentions that mutations are found throughout the gene, including the kinase domain, but no specific mutations are named. 

So, the extracted information would have the gene as LRRK2 and variants with all fields as N.D. because the text doesn't provide specific mutation details like cDNA changes or protein changes.
