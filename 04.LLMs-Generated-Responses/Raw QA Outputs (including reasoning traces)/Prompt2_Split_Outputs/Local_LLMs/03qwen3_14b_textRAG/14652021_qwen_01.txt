Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to extract any mutation information mentioned in the literature. 

First, the abstract mentions that mutations in the DJ-1 gene are linked to autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism (AR-EOP). Then, in the main text, it says that the DJ-1 gene includes a large deletion. Also, there's a mention of the L166P mutant DJ-1. 

So, I need to identify the gene names and the specific mutations. The gene is DJ-1, and the mutations are a large deletion and the L166P mutation. The L166P is a protein change, where the amino acid at position 166 is changed from Leucine (L) to Proline (P). 

The text doesn't provide cDNA changes, so those fields should be "N.D." The description in the context for the L166P mutation is that it's a mutant DJ-1. The large deletion is another mutation, but the description is just "a large deletion."

I need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. Let me check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The text also refers to Pael receptor as a substrate of Parkin, but that's not a mutation in DJ-1. So no other mutations here.

Putting it all together, the variants should include the large deletion and the L166P mutation. Each variant will have their respective details. I need to make sure that for cDNA changes, since they aren't mentioned, I use "N.D." for transcript, ref, alt, and position. For the protein change, the L166P will have ref as L and alt as P at position 166. The description for the large deletion is "a large deletion" and for L166P it's "L166P mutant DJ-1."
