Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraph. First, I need to carefully read through the text to identify any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the abstract and introduction, the key mutation mentioned is I2020T in the LRRK2 gene. The text states that the Sagamihara family patients have the I2020T mutation in the kinase domain. Also, there's a mention of other LRRK2 mutations reported worldwide, but the specific one discussed in the study is I2020T.

Now, I need to structure this into the JSON format. The gene is clearly LRRK2. The variant has a cDNA change, but the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position or transcript, so those fields should be "N.D." The protein change is I2020T, which corresponds to the amino acid positions. The description in the context is "I2020T mutation in the kinase domain."

I should check if there are other mutations mentioned. The text says 23 LRRK2 mutations have been reported, but the main focus here is on I2020T. Other mutations aren't detailed, so they don't need to be included unless specified. Since the user wants only the information present, I'll stick to I2020T.

Make sure all fields are filled with "N.D." where information isn't provided. The variants array should have one entry for I2020T. Double-check the JSON structure to ensure it matches the example given.
