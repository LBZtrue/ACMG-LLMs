Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided literature. First, I need to carefully read through the text to find any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the introduction section, I see that the mutations A30P, A53T, and E46K are mentioned as missense mutations for a-Syn associated with familial PD. The text also refers to these as familial Parkinson’s disease mutations. 

Next, I need to structure this into the JSON format specified. The gene here is a-Synuclein, which is often abbreviated as a-Syn. The variants should be listed as an array. Each variant will have the cDNA change and protein change. However, the text doesn't provide specific cDNA positions or transcript information, so those fields should be "N.D." The protein changes are the mutations themselves: A30P, A53T, E46K. The description in the input context is the statement about their association with familial PD.

I should check if there are any other mutations mentioned, but from a quick scan, those three are the only ones. The rest of the text discusses the effects of these mutations but doesn't mention other mutations. So, the JSON should list these three variants with their respective details, filling in "N.D." where information isn't provided.
