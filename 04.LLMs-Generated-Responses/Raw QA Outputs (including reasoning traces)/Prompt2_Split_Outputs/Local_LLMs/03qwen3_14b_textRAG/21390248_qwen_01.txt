Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the given abstract. First, I need to check if there are any mentions of mutations. The abstract talks about LRRK2 mutations causing Parkinson's disease. Specifically, it lists R1441G, Y1699C, and G2019S as common PD-related mutations. 

So, the gene here is LRRK2. Now, for each mutation, I need to break down the cDNA change and protein change. The example provided by the user uses the format with ref and alt for both cDNA and protein changes. 

Looking at R1441G: The cDNA change isn't specified in the abstract, so transcript is N.D. The protein change is from R (arginine) to G (glycine) at position 1441. Similarly for Y1699C: protein change is Y (tyrosine) to C (cysteine) at 1699. And G2019S: G (glycine) to S (serine) at 2019. 

Each of these mutations is mentioned in the context of decreasing phosphorylation levels and impairing 14-3-3 binding. The description in the input context should include the mutation names as given. 

I need to make sure that for each variant, the cDNA change has transcript as N.D. since the abstract doesn't mention specific transcripts. The protein changes are clear. Also, check if there are other mutations mentioned, but the abstract only lists these three. 

So the JSON structure should have Gene as LRRK2, and variants array with each of these three mutations. Each variant has cDNA Change with transcript N.D., and the respective ref and alt for protein change. The description includes the mutation names as given in the text. 

I think that's all. No other mutations are mentioned. The other parts of the abstract discuss phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding but don't mention other mutations. So the answer should include these three mutations with the specified details.
