Okay, let me start by carefully reading the provided text to see if there's any mention of mutations related to Parkinson's disease. The user is asking specifically about mutations in the PINK1 gene.

Looking at the abstract, the first sentence says: "Mutations of the mitochondrial PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue)-induced kinase1 (PINK1) are important causes of recessive Parkinson disease (PD)." So here, it clearly states that mutations in PINK1 are linked to PD. 

Next, in the introduction, they mention that PINK1 mutations are involved in various phenotypes like apoptosis, mitochondrial morphology, dopamine release, and motor deficits. The study shows that PINK1 deficiency or clinical mutations impact Complex I function. 

The key part here is where they talk about clinical mutations. The text says, "human wild type PINK1, but not PINK1 containing clinical mutations, can rescue Complex 1 deficiency." This implies that there are specific clinical mutations in PINK1 that are being referred to, but the text doesn't provide the exact cDNA changes or protein alterations. 

The user's example shows that when there's no specific variant information, we use "N.D." So even though the text mentions mutations, it doesn't give the exact nucleotide or protein changes. Therefore, the "variants" array should have entries with "N.D." for the transcript, ref, alt, position in both cDNA and protein changes. 

I need to make sure I don't infer any details that aren't explicitly stated. The gene is definitely PINK1, and the mutations are clinical mutations, but without specific positions or changes, the rest should be "N.D.".
