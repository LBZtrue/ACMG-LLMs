Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the given paragraph. The paragraph is about PINK1 and Parkin's role in mitochondrial dysfunction and parkinsonism. The abstract mentions that loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and Parkin cause parkinsonism and mitochondrial dysfunction in model organisms. It also states that disease-causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and mitophagy at distinct steps.

So, the key points here are the mention of "loss-of-function mutations" in both PINK1 and Parkin. The term "loss-of-function" is a type of mutation, but the specific details like cDNA changes or protein changes aren't provided. The abstract doesn't give any specific mutations, like exact nucleotide changes or amino acid substitutions. It just refers to mutations in general. 

The user's example shows that if there are no specific mutations listed, like c.248G>A, then the fields should be N.D. In this case, the literature does mention mutations but not their specific details. Therefore, according to the constraints, I should extract the gene names and indicate that the variants are not detailed. 

So the JSON should have "Gene" as both PINK1 and Parkin, and under "variants", each would have N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, position, and protein change. The description in the input context would be "loss-of-function mutations" for each gene. 

I need to make sure that I don't add any information that's not there. Since the paper doesn't specify the exact mutations, only the type (loss-of-function), I have to stick with that. The user's instruction says to return N.D. if not mentioned. So the answer should reflect that.
