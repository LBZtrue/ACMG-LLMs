Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to carefully read through the text to identify any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the first paragraph, there's a mention of the E46K mutation in the amino-terminal region of α-synuclein. The text also refers to the A53T mutation and the substitution of Glu46 with Ala. Then, in the second paragraph, there's a discussion about Glu83 being mutated to Lys or Ala. 

I need to extract the gene name, which here is α-synuclein. The variants mentioned are E46K, A53T, and the Glu46 to Ala substitution. For each variant, I should note the cDNA changes if provided, but the text doesn't mention transcript positions or specific cDNA changes, so those would be N.D. The protein changes are the amino acid substitutions: E46K, A53T, and E46A. The description in the context includes details about the effect of these mutations on fibril formation and polymerization.

I should make sure that each variant is listed under the "variants" array with the corresponding protein changes and descriptions. Since the text doesn't provide cDNA changes, those fields will remain N.D. Also, check for any other mutations mentioned, but it seems only these three are discussed. Finally, structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring all required fields are present with N.D. where information is missing.
