Figure 1 .1Figure 1. (A) Amino acid sequence of human DJ-1. Locations of disease linked mutations M26I, E64D, A104T, D149A, and L166P are underlined, with the mutations indicated in boldface above the wild-type sequence. (B) Crystal structure of the w

elix 1 and the N-terminal regions of the three affected b-strands, as well as an alteration in the C-terminal region of a-helix 7 and a part of helix 8.
The A104T mutation is found in b-strand 7 of the wildtype structure, near its C-terminal end. Chemical shift changes caused by this mutation are associated with residues in the C-terminal ends of a

owledge of the high-resolution structure of wildtype DJ-1 allows us to identify the structural elements that are most likely perturbed by each of the mutations by mapping the locations associated with chemical shift changes onto the structure. Figure 8 shows such a mapping for each of the three mutants. In the case of the M26I mutation, which occur

## tables
Table 1 .1Table 1. Chemical shift changes for the M26I mutant.a Chemical shift changes were calculated as the sum of the weighted chemical shift changes for both 1H and 15N nuclei. Only those residues with chemical shift changes greater than 0.05 ppm are listed. The secondary structure assignments for DJ-1 are based on the crystal structure (PDB code 1P5F).
