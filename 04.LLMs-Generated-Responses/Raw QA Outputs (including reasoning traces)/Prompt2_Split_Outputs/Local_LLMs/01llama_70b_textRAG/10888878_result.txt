Question:
 
- Role: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert
- Background: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. The user aims to quickly and accurately identify whether the literature contains mutation information and extract relevant details.
- Profile: You are an expert with extensive experience in the field of medical literature data mining, familiar with the structure and terminology of biomedical literature, and skilled at precisely extracting key information from large volumes of text.
- Skills: You possess strong text analysis capabilities, a deep understanding of biomedical terminology, and proficient use of data mining techniques, enabling you to quickly identify and extract mutation information from literature.
- Goals: Determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations. If it does, extract relevant details; if not, return "N.D.".
- Constraints: Extract only information directly related to mutations, ensure the extracted information is accurate, and use "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
- Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
- Workflow:
  1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
  2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
  3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

Question:
 
- Role: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert
- Background: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. The user aims to quickly and accurately identify whether the literature contains mutation information and extract relevant details.
- Profile: You are an expert with extensive experience in the field of medical literature data mining, familiar with the structure and terminology of biomedical literature, and skilled at precisely extracting key information from large volumes of text.
- Skills: You possess strong text analysis capabilities, a deep understanding of biomedical terminology, and proficient use of data mining techniques, enabling you to quickly identify and extract mutation information from literature.
- Goals: Determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations. If it does, extract relevant details; if not, return "N.D.".
- Constraints: Extract only information directly related to mutations, ensure the extracted information is accurate, and use "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
- Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
- Workflow:
  1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
  2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
  3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

- Background: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. The user aims to quickly and accurately identify whether the literature contains mutation information and extract relevant details.
- Profile: You are an expert with extensive experience in the field of medical literature data mining, familiar with the structure and terminology of biomedical literature, and skilled at precisely extracting key information from large volumes of text.
- Skills: You possess strong text analysis capabilities, a deep understanding of biomedical terminology, and proficient use of data mining techniques, enabling you to quickly identify and extract mutation information from literature.
- Goals: Determine whether the input text paragraph contains information related to mutations. If it does, extract relevant details; if not, return "N.D.".
- Constraints: Extract only information directly related to mutations, ensure the extracted information is accurate, and use "N.D." to supplement content that is not mentioned.
- Output Format: Return the extracted information in the specified JSON format.
- Workflow:
  1. Carefully read the input text paragraph and identify whether it contains mutation-related terms or descriptions.
  2. If mutation information is found, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions.
  3. For content not mentioned, supplement with "N.D." to ensure the returned information is complete and meets the format requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."
    Extracted Information:
    ```json
    {
        "Gene": "TP53",
        "variants": [
            {
                "cDNA Change": {
                    "transcript": "N.D.",
                    "ref": "G",
                    "alt": "A",
                    "position": "248"
                },
                "Protein Change": {
                    "ref": "G",
                    "alt": "D",
                    "position": "83"
                },
                "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```


Answer:
 
The input text paragraph does not contain any information related to mutations. Therefore, according to the provided JSON format, the output should be:

```json
{
  "Gene": "N.D.",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Description in input context": "N.D."
