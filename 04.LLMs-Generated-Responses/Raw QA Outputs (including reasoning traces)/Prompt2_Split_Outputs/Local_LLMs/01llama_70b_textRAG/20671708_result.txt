Explanation:
The input text paragraph does not contain mutation-related information. Therefore, all fields are marked as "N.D." in the output. If the input text paragraph contains mutation information, specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions should be extracted and returned in the JSON format.
