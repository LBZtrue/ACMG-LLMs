### Example 2:
Context:
## abstract:
Background: Germline mutations in the MSH2 and MLH1 mismatch repair genes are found in approximately 60% of families with Lynch syndrome. We explored the prevalence of mutations in these genes among a large series of patients with colorectal cancer and a family history of the disease. Methods: We sequenced all exons of the MSH2 and MLH1 genes in 193 patients with colorectal cancer who had a family history of the disease. Results: Thirty-six patients (19%) had a germline mutation in either the MSH2 or MLH1 gene. The frequency of mutations was 10% among patients with colorectal cancer and one or more affected first-degree relatives and 41% among patients with colorectal cancer and two or more affected first-degree relatives. Conclusions: Germline mutations in the MSH2 and MLH1 genes are present in approximately 10% of patients with colorectal cancer and one or more affected first-degree relatives and in 41% of patients with colorectal cancer and two or more affected first-degree relatives.

### Example 3:
Context:
## abstract:
A multicenter randomized trial compared the effectiveness of two drugs, Drug A and Drug B, in the treatment of hypertension. The study included 500 patients who were randomized to receive either Drug A or Drug B for 12 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome was the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the percentage of patients achieving SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg, and adverse events. The results showed that Drug A was associated with a greater reduction in SBP compared with Drug B (mean difference -7.2 mmHg; 95% CI -9.4 to -5.0; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two drugs in the change in DBP or in the percentage of patients achieving SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. In conclusion, this study found that Drug A was more effective than Drug B in reducing systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension.

### Example 4:
Context:
## abstract:
A recent study investigated the impact of a new drug, Drug X, on survival in patients with advanced cancer. The study included 100 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either Drug X or a placebo. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, response rate, and adverse events. The results showed that Drug X was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival compared with the placebo (median survival time: 12 months vs. 6 months, P < 0.01). Progression-free survival and response rate were also significantly improved in the Drug X group. However, the incidence of adverse events was higher in the Drug X group compared with the placebo group. In conclusion, this study found that Drug X was more effective than the placebo in improving survival in patients with advanced cancer, but it also had a higher risk of adverse events.

### Example 5:
Context:
## abstract:
Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and dementia. The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype has been shown to influence susceptibility to AD. We investigated the association between the ApoE genotype and brain structure in healthy older adults. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of 197 healthy older adults (mean age: 73.4 years, SD: 6.6) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ApoE genotyping. Brain volumes were measured using FreeSurfer software and adjusted for age, sex, and total intracranial volume. Results: Compared with participants with the ApoE ε4/ε4 genotype, those with the ApoE ε3/ε3 genotype had significantly larger volumes of the hippocampus (mean difference: 0.5 mL, 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.9, P = 0.013), entorhinal cortex (mean difference: 0.2 mL, 95% CI: 0.0 to 0.4, P = 0.048), and posterior cingulate cortex (mean difference: 0.3 mL, 95% CI: 0.0 to 0.5, P = 0.037). There were no significant differences in brain volume between individuals with the ApoE ε2/ε3 and ε3/ε3 genotypes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the ApoE genotype may be associated with regional differences in brain structure in healthy older adults. Further studies are needed to determine whether these differences are related to risk of AD.

### Example 6:
Context:
## abstract:
Background: The human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA. However, only about 1% of these base pairs encode proteins. The remaining 99% are considered non-coding regions. Recent studies have shown that many non-coding regions contain regulatory elements that control gene expression. These regulatory elements can be mutated in diseases such as cancer. We investigated the prevalence and types of mutations in non-coding regions of the genome in patients with breast cancer. Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing of 100 patients with breast cancer and analyzed the non-coding regions for mutations. Results: We identified a total of 1,234 mutations in non-coding regions. The most common type of mutation was a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which accounted for 78% of all mutations. Other types of mutations included insertions, deletions, and translocations. The majority of the mutations were located in regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers, and insulators. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that mutations in non-coding regions of the genome may play a role in breast cancer pathogenesis.

### Example 7:
Context:
## abstract:
Background: Lynch syndrome is an inherited disorder that increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer, including colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. The condition is caused by mutations in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair. We investigated the prevalence of Lynch syndrome among patients with colorectal cancer and the characteristics of patients with Lynch syndrome. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of all patients with colorectal cancer who underwent genetic testing for Lynch syndrome at our institution between January 2010 and December 2015. We collected data on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, family history of cancer, and results of genetic testing. Results: A total of 1,000 patients with colorectal cancer were included in the study. Of these, 50 (5%) had a pathogenic mutation in a DNA mismatch repair gene consistent with a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. The median age at diagnosis was 44 years (range, 25-75). The most common tumor location was the right colon (60%). Patients with Lynch syndrome were more likely to have a family history of cancer (80% vs. 40%, p<0.001) and multiple primary tumors (20% vs. 5%, p<0.001) compared with patients without Lynch syndrome. Conclusion: Lynch syndrome is a relatively rare condition that accounts for approximately 5% of all cases of colorectal cancer. Patients with Lynch syndrome are at increased risk of developing multiple primary tumors and have a strong family history of cancer.

### Example 8:
Context:
## abstract:
Background: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which are crucial for the immune system to function properly. The virus incorporates its genetic material into the host cell's genome, resulting in the production of new viruses. We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of mutations in the HIV genome. Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing of HIV isolates from 100 patients with AIDS. We analyzed the sequences for mutations and classified them based on their location, type, and effect on viral fitness. Results: We identified a total of 1,234 mutations in the HIV genome. The majority of these mutations were located in non-coding regions (76%) or in coding regions but did not result in amino acid changes (18%). Only 6% of the mutations resulted in amino acid changes that could potentially affect viral fitness. The most common type of mutation was a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which accounted for 78% of all mutations. Other types of mutations included insertions, deletions, and translocations. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that mutations in the HIV genome are common and can occur in both coding and non-coding regions. However, the majority of these mutations do not result in significant changes in viral fitness.

Context:
## abstract:
Background: The KRAS gene encodes a small GTPase that plays a key role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in the KRAS gene are commonly found in a variety of cancers, including pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancer. We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of KRAS mutations in a cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer. Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing of tumor tissue from 100 patients with pancreatic cancer. We identified mutations in the KRAS gene and classified them based on their location, type, and effect on protein function. Results: We identified a total of 1,234 mutations in the KRAS gene. The majority of these mutations were located in codon 12 (73%) or codon 13 (20%) of exon 2. The most common type of mutation was a point mutation, which accounted for 98% of all mutations. Other types of mutations included insertions, deletions, and translocations. The majority of the mutations resulted in amino acid changes that were predicted to have a deleterious effect on protein function. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that mutations in the KRAS gene are common and can occur in both coding and non-coding regions. However, the majority of these mutations result in amino acid changes that are predicted to have a deleterious effect on protein function.
