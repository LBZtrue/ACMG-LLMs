# Extracting mutation information from medical literature paragraphs with JSON formatting

## Example 1:

Input Text Paragraph:
"In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "248"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "83"
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
In this example, we can see that the input text paragraph mentions a specific mutation in the TP53 gene, namely c.248G>A (p.G83D). We extract this information and organize it into a JSON format, where each variant is represented by a dictionary containing its cDNA change, protein change, and description. Since there is no mention of a transcript, we use "N.D." as a placeholder. The output JSON follows the specified format, including the gene name, variants list, and their corresponding details.

## Example 2:

Input Text Paragraph:
"Further analysis revealed that the p.V600E mutation in BRAF was also present in some patients with colorectal cancer."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "BRAF",
    "variants": [
        {
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "V",
                "alt": "E",
                "position": "600"
            },
            "Description in input context": "p.V600E"
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
In this example, the input text paragraph mentions the p.V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. We extract this information and organize it into a JSON format, including the gene name and variants list. Since there is no mention of a cDNA change or transcript, we omit those fields from the output JSON. We ensure that the output follows the specified format, providing only the relevant mutation information.

## Example 3:

Input Text Paragraph:
"No significant mutations were identified in the APC gene among the breast cancer cohort."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "APC",
    "variants": [
        {
            "Description in input context": "No significant mutations"
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
In this example, the input text paragraph states that no significant mutations were found in the APC gene. We extract this information and organize it into a JSON format, including the gene name and a variant dictionary with the description. Since there is no mention of specific mutations, we use a generic description to capture the absence of significant mutations. The output JSON follows the specified format, ensuring that all relevant information is included.

## Example 4:

Input Text Paragraph:
"A novel frameshift mutation, c.67_68insA, was identified in the MLH1 gene in a subset of ovarian cancer patients."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "MLH1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "67_68insA",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "c.67_68insA"
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
In this example, the input text paragraph mentions a novel frameshift mutation, c.67_68insA, in the MLH1 gene. We extract this information and organize it into a JSON format, including the gene name and a variant dictionary with the cDNA change and description. Since there is no mention of a protein change or transcript, we use "N.D." as placeholders. The output JSON follows the specified format, capturing all relevant mutation information.

## Example 5:

Input Text Paragraph:
"Analysis of the KRAS gene revealed the presence of the G12D mutation in a majority of pancreatic cancer cases."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "KRAS",
    "variants": [
        {
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "12"
            },
            "Description in input context": "G12D"
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
In this example, the input text paragraph mentions the G12D mutation in the KRAS gene. We extract this information and organize it into a JSON format, including the gene name and a variant dictionary with the protein change and description. Since there is no mention of a cDNA change or transcript, we omit those fields from the output JSON. The output JSON follows the specified format, providing only the relevant mutation information.

## Example 6:

Input Text Paragraph:
"Further investigation revealed that the NBN gene harbored the c.1084delA mutation in a subset of glioblastoma patients."

Extracted Information:
```json
{
    "Gene": "NBN",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "1084delA",
                "alt": "N.D.",

            },
            "Description in input context": "c.1084delA"
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
In this example, the input text paragraph mentions the c.1084delA mutation in the NBN gene. We extract this information and organize it into a JSON format, including the gene name and a variant dictionary with the cDNA change and description. Since there is no mention of a protein change or transcript, we use "N.D." as placeholders. The output JSON follows the specified format, capturing all relevant mutation information.

## Example 7:

Input Text Paragraph:
"Additional sequencing identified the p.R183Q mutation in the PTEN gene in a small proportion of prostate cancer patients."
