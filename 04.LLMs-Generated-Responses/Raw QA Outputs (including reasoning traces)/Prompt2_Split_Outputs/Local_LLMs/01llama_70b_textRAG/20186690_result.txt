##Discussion

Our data demonstrate that LRRK2 mutations are seen in PD patients from Asia. The frequency of LRRK2 mutations is similar to that seen in Caucasian populations. The distribution of mutations within the LRRK2 gene is similar to that previously reported. The majority of the mutations we identified were missense mutations. Only one nonsense mutation was identified and this was not found in any of the controls. The majority of the mutations were clustered within the ROC and COR domains of the LRRK2 gene. The functional consequences of these mutations have not yet been determined. However, it is likely that these mutations will result in alterations in the kinase activity of LRRK2. Further studies are needed to determine the functional consequences of these mutations and their role in the pathogenesis of PD.
