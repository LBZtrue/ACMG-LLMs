## Context:

### Experimental procedures

#### DNA constructs

The coding region of human parkin was amplified from a human brain cDNA library and inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), as described previously (Winklhofer et al. 2003a). Amino acid deletions and substitutions were introduced by PCR cloning techniques.

#### In vitro translation

In vitro translation was performed using the
