    Autosomal dominant mutations in the human Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene represent the most common monogenetic cause for Parkinson disease (PD) accounting for up to 7% of familial PD and for a significant fraction of sporadic PD cases in the European population (1). Most of the pathogenic missense mutations identified in LRRK2 are located in the central catalytic GTPase (ROC) and kinase domains (2). However, the physiological role of LRRK2 remains largely unknown. Recent evidence suggests that LRRK2 may function as a scaffold protein that interacts with multiple proteins (3–6), but direct downstream effectors of LRRK2 have not yet been identified. In Drosophila, loss-of-function mutations in Lrrk result in male sterility due to defects in spermatid individualization (7). In mammalian cells, overexpression of wild-type or pathogenic mutants leads to neuronal toxicity and induces autophagic cell death (8–10). Furthermore, inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity by small molecule inhibitors or by RNAi-mediated knockdown can partially reverse the cytotoxic effects mediated by LRRK2 mutants (11–13). These findings suggest that the kinase activity of LRRK2 is essential for its cellular functions and that pathogenic mutations lead to aberrant kinase activity. Indeed, several groups have shown that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase its autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation (13–16). The kinase activity of LRRK2 is stimulated by GTP binding to the ROC domain (17). How this activity is regulated remains unclear. One possibility is that the GTPase activity of ROC is needed for full activation of the kinase domain. Alternatively, the binding of other proteins to LRRK2 may regulate its kinase activity. In support of this latter possibility, we recently showed that the WD40 domain of c-Abl tyrosine kinase binds to LRRK2 and inhibits its kinase activity (18). We also found that LRRK2 can phosphorylate c-Abl at several serine residues, including Ser345, which lies within the activation loop of the kinase domain. Phosphorylation of this residue by LRRK2 leads to increased c-Abl kinase activity, suggesting that c-Abl is a downstream effector of LRRK2. In this study we explored whether MAPK kinases MKK3 and MKK6, which regulate the p38 MAPK pathway, are also substrates of LRRK2. MKK3 and MKK6 share high sequence similarity in their kinase domains, but differ in their N-terminal regulatory domains. Both proteins contain a proline-rich motif (PRM) in this region, which mediates binding to SH3 domains of src family tyrosine kinases (19). The PRM is followed by a D-motif that binds to the catalytic domain of MKK3 or MKK6 and promotes autophosphorylation (20). Autophosphorylation then leads to activation of the MKK3/6 kinase domains. Binding of MKK3/6 to their substrates p38 MAPK is mediated by a short docking site located C-terminal to the kinase domain (21). Here we show that LRRK2 can phosphorylate MKK3/6 at multiple sites, including Ser207 in the PRM and Thr222 in the D-motif. Phosphorylation of Ser207 leads to dissociation of MKK3/6 from LRRK2 and activation of their kinase activity. In contrast, phosphorylation of Thr222 does not affect binding to LRRK2 but reduces the autophosphorylation of MKK3/6. These results indicate that LRRK2 regulates the p38 MAPK pathway by phosphorylating MKK3/6 at two distinct sites.
