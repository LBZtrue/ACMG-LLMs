Based on the given paragraph, I have extracted the following information:
```JSON
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "C",
                "alt": "I",
                "position": "106"

            },
            "Description in input context": "C106I"

                "transcript": "N.D.",

                "position": "26"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "M",
                "alt": "I",
                "position": "26"
            },
            "Description in input context": "M26I"
        }
    ]
}
```
Explanation:
- The gene mentioned in the paragraph is "DJ-1".
- There are two described variants:
  - The first variant is "C106I", which involves changing the cysteine at position 106 to isoleucine.
  - The second variant is "M26I", which involves changing the methionine at position 26 to isoleucine.
- As there are no specific references to cDNA or transcript changes, we can assume these mutations occur at the protein level only.
- Since no further details about the mutations' effects or consequences were provided, I have included them as descriptions in the input context.
- If any additional information becomes available, it can be added accordingly.
