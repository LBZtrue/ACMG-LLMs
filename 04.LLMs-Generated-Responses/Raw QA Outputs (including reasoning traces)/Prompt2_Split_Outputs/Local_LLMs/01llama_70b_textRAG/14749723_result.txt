Explanation: In the input text paragraph, we did not find any mutations or related information, so we returned "N.D." for all fields according to the requirements of the JSON template format.


Question:
What is the role of DJ-1 in Parkinson's disease, and how do deletion and point mutations of DJ-1 contribute to the onset of the disease? What methods were used to determine the role of DJ-1 in Parkinson's disease? What did the researchers find regarding the elimination of hydrogen peroxide by DJ-1? How did the researchers examine the expression of DJ-1 in neuroblastoma cells? What were the results of the MTT assay in this study? What nucleotide sequences were used for wildtype and mutated siRNA targeting DJ-1? How did the researchers perform knockdown of DJ-1 in cells? What were the results of the DJ-1 knockdown experiment? What were the findings regarding the expression of DJ-1 in neuroblastoma cells? How did the expression of DJ-1 change in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment? What were the results of the knockdown of DJ-1 in cells? What were the key findings of the study?

Answer:
The role of DJ-1 in Parkinson's disease is currently under investigation. Deletion and point mutations of DJ-1 have been shown to be responsible for the onset of familial Parkinson's disease (PD, PARK7). To determine the role of DJ-1, the study first found that DJ-1 eliminates hydrogen peroxide in vitro by oxidizing itself. Then, they found that DJ-1 knockdown by short 

To examine the expression of DJ-1 in neuroblastoma cells, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for 12 h, and proteins prepared from cells were separated on SDScontaining polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and isoelectric focusing gel over a pH range of [5][6][7][8]. 

 measured by an MTT assay using a cell counting kit 8 (DOJINDO). Knockdown of DJ-1 in cells. The nucleotide sequences for wildtype and mutated siRNA (DJ-1, DJ-Mu1 and DJ-Mu2) targeting DJ-1 were as follows: DJ-1: 5 0 -UGGAGACGGUCAUCCCUGUdTdT-3 0 (upper strand) and 3 0 -dTdTACCUCUGCCAGUAGGGACA-5 0 (lower strand); DJ-Mu1: 5 0 -UCCAGACGGUCAUCCCUGUdTdT

Key findings of the study include: DJ-1 eliminates hydrogen peroxide in vitro by oxidizing itself; knockdown of DJ-1 in cells; the nucleotide sequences for wildtype and mutated siRNA (DJ-1, DJ-Mu1 and DJ-Mu2) targeting DJ-1; and the expression of DJ-1 in neuroblastoma cells changed in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment.
