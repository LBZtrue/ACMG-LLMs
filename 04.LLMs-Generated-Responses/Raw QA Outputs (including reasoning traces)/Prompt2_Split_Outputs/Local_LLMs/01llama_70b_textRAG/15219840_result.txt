- Rationale: The input text paragraph mentions four DJ-1 gene mutations, including Gly16Ala (G16A), Leu26Pro (L26P), Arg98Gln (R98Q), and Asp149Ala (D149A). However, the specific cDNA change and protein change information are not mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, "N.D." is used to supplement these fields.
