Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) was performed using SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and an iCycler IQ Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad). Expressions of DJ-1 and TTRAP were analyzed usi

The expected output for this input text should be:
```json

Please help me write a Python script that can achieve this task.

## Prompt 12:
Please help me write a Python script that can extract information from the input text and format it into a JSON object as described above.

## Prompt 13:
I am a professional medical literature data mining expert. My role is to extract information from medical literature articles, which may involve complex biomedical terminology and specific mutation descriptions. 

The user provides me with a paragraph of English text from a medical literature article, which may contain information about genes, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions in the input context. My goal is to extract this information and format it into a JSON object.

If any of the above information is not mentioned in the input text, I should fill it with "N.D." to indicate that it is not described in the input context. The JSON output should follow the following format:
```json
{
    "Gene": "",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "",
                "ref": "",
                "alt": "",
                "position": ""
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "",
                "alt": "",
                "position": ""
            },
            "Description in input context": ""
        }
    ]
}
```
Here is an example input text:
rent oligonucleotide sequences were selected for the knockdown TTRAP expression using siRNA Target Finder software (Invitrogen). The hairpin-encoding oligonucleotides were cloned into the pSuperior vector (Invitrogen). Details are available on Supplementary material.
Cell culture and transfections. HEK-293T (Sigma) and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y c

ne deletions have been associated with a loss-of-function phenotype, the pathogenic mechanism of several missense mutations is less clear.
