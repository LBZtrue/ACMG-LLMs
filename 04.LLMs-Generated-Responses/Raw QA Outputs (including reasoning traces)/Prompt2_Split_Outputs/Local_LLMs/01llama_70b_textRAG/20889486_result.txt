      "Gene": "Parkin",
      "variants": [
        {
          "cDNA Change": {
            "ref": "N.D.",
            "alt": "N.D.",
            "position": "N.D."

          "Protein Change": {
            "ref": "N.D.",
            "alt": "N.D.",
            "position": "N.D."
          },
          "Description in input context": "N.D."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The input paragraph does not contain any information about mutations of the Parkin gene, so all fields under "cDNA Change", "Protein Change", and "Description in input context" are marked as "N.D." (Not Determined).
