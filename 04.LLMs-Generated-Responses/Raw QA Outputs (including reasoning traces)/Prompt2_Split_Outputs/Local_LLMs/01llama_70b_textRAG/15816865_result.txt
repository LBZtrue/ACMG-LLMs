Based on the provided literature data, here is the extracted information in the specified JSON format:
```json
{
    "Gene": "parkin",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "mutations in parkin"
        }
    ]
}
```
Explanation: The input text paragraph mentions "mutations in parkin," indicating that there are likely specific gene variants or mutations associated with parkin. However, the paragraph does not provide any specific details about these mutations. Therefore, I have included "N.D." (not described) for the cDNA Change and Protein Change fields, as well as the Description field, to indicate that the context mentions mutations in parkin but does not provide specific variant details.
