Input text paragraph: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

}
```
Explanation:

The input text paragraph mentions a genetic mutation, specifically c.248G>A (p.G83D), occurring in the TP53 gene. This information can be extracted into three parts: 

1. Gene name: TP53
2. cDNA Change: c.248G>A
3. Protein Change: p.G83D

Since there is no specific mention of a transcript in the input context, we use N.D. as a placeholder for this field. The final output is a JSON object containing the gene name and a list of variants, each representing a single mutation. Each variant includes details about the cDNA change, protein change, and description as found in the input context.
