Explanation: Based on the provided input context, the paragraph mentions the detection of the c.157G4A (formerly G209A) sequence variation in the SNCA gene. The extracted information includes the gene name ("SNCA"), the cDNA change ("c.157G4A"), and the description of the variant within the input context ("c.157G4A (formerly G209A)"). However, as no specific protein change is mentioned, the "Protein Change" field is marked as "N.D." to indicate "Not Described". The transcript field is also marked as "N.D." since it is not mentioned in the input context.
