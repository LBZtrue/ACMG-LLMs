Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation-related information. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions DJ-1 gene mutations linked to AR-EOP. It talks about loss of DJ-1 function causing the phenotype. Then there's a part about Parkin gene (PARK2) mutations in AR-JP. Also, DJ-1 has mutations including a large deletion. The example given in the problem includes specific details like cDNA changes and protein changes, but in the current text, the mutations are described more generally.

Looking for gene names: DJ-1 (also called PARK7) and Parkin (PARK2). The mutations mentioned are a large deletion in DJ-1. The text doesn't specify exact cDNA changes or protein positions, just that the mutations cause Parkinsonism through loss of protein or function. So, the variants here are the large deletion, but no specific positions. The example in the problem had a c.248G>A, but here, the text doesn't provide that level of detail. So, I need to check if there's any specific mutation description. The answer should include the gene names and the mutation type, even if it's a large deletion. Since the user wants only mutation info, and the text does mention mutations in DJ-1 and Parkin, but the Parkin part is about mutations in the gene leading to AR-JP. However, the main focus here is on DJ-1. The large deletion is a mutation, so that's a variant. The protein change isn't specified, so maybe that's N.D. for protein change. The description in the input is that the mutations cause loss of DJ-1 protein or function. So, the variants would be the large deletion in DJ-1. The Parkin part mentions mutations in the PARK2 gene, but the text doesn't specify the exact mutation, just that they have mutations. So, maybe that's another variant. But the example in the problem included a specific cDNA change. In the given text, the Parkin part says "mutations in the Parkin gene (PARK2)", but no specific cDNA or protein changes. So, for Parkin, the mutation is just "mutations" without specifics. However, the user's example included a variant with cDNA and protein changes. So, in this case, the answer should list DJ-1 with a large deletion, and Parkin with N.D. for the details. Wait, the text says "mutations in the DJ-1 gene include a large deletion", so that's a specific mutation. For Parkin, the text says "mutations in Parkin gene (PARK2)" but no specific details. So, the answer should include DJ-1 with a large deletion, and Parkin with N.D. for variants. But the example in the problem included both genes. So, the answer here would have two entries: DJ-1 and Parkin. For DJ-1, the variant is a large deletion. For Parkin, since the text doesn't specify, it's N.D. But the text does mention that Parkin mutations are in the PARK2 gene, so maybe that's a variant, but without specific details. So, the correct extraction would be DJ-1 with a large deletion, and Parkin with N.D. for variants. The description in the input context would be "mutations in the DJ-1 gene include a large deletion" and "mutations in Parkin gene (PARK2)". So, the JSON should have two entries: one for DJ-1 with the large deletion, and another for Parkin with N.D. for variants. But the example in the problem had a single gene. However, the user's example included multiple variants for a single gene. So, here, the answer should have two genes: DJ-1 and Parkin. For DJ-1, the variant is a large deletion. For Parkin, since the text doesn't specify any cDNA or protein changes, the variants would be N.D. So, the final answer would be two entries: DJ-1 with a large deletion, and Parkin with N.D. for variants.
