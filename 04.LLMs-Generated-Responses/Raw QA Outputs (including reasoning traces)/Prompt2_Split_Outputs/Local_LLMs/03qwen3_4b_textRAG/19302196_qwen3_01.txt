Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation-related information. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions "Autosomal dominant mutations in the human Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene" which is a key point. Then it refers to specific mutations: "G2019S" and mentions that it's responsible for a percentage of familial PD cases in different populations. The text also states that patients with these mutations have a late onset and clinical features similar to idiopathic cases. 

Looking at the structure, the main mutation discussed is G2019S in the LRRK2 gene. The cDNA change isn't explicitly given here, but the protein change is p.G2019S. The description in the context is "G2019S" which is the mutation. The gene is LRRK2. The other mentions about the mutation's effect are about the percentage of cases and clinical features, but those are more about the impact rather than the mutation details. 

I need to check if there are other mutations mentioned. The text also talks about "several LRRK2 variants associated with PD" but doesn't specify their exact changes. The example given in the user's example includes cDNA and protein changes, but here, the only specific mutation is G2019S. The rest is about the prevalence and clinical features, which are not mutation details. So, the only relevant mutation here is G2019S in the LRRK2 gene. 

I should structure the JSON with Gene as LRRK2, variants with the cDNA and protein changes. Since the cDNA change isn't specified, maybe the transcript is N.D., but the protein change is G2019S. The description in the input context is "G2019S". The other parts like the percentage and clinical features are not mutation details, so they should be N.D. for those fields. 

Wait, the user's example includes "cDNA Change" and "Protein Change". In this case, the mutation is described as G2019S, which is a protein change. The cDNA change isn't provided here, so I need to check if there's any mention of that. The text says "G2019S" is the mutation, but maybe that's the protein change. The cDNA change would be the corresponding nucleotide change. However, the abstract doesn't specify the cDNA change, so I should leave that as N.D. unless there's a way to infer it. But according to the instructions, I can only use what's explicitly stated. Since the text doesn't mention the cDNA change, I have to put N.D. for that. 

So the final JSON should have Gene: LRRK2, variants with cDNA Change as N.D., Protein Change as G2019S, and Description as G2019S. The other fields like the percentage and clinical features are not mutation details, so they are N.D. But the user's example only includes the variants, so I need to make sure to only include the mutation details. The rest of the text is about the effect of the mutation, not the mutation itself. Therefore, the answer should focus on the G2019S mutation in LRRK2.
