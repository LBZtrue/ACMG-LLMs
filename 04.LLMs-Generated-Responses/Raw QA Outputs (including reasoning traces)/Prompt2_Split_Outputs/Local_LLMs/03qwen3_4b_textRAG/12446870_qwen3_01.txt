Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract talks about D. radiodurans and Mn²⁺ affecting its radioresistance. It mentions DNA toroids and nucleoid structure. There's a part about irradiated recA-deficient mutants. The key here is to look for any mention of mutations, gene names, or genetic changes.

Looking through the text: "irradiated recA-deficient D. radiodurans mutants" – here, "recA-deficient" indicates a mutation in the recA gene. The term "deficient" suggests a mutation or loss of function in that gene. However, the text doesn't specify the exact mutation type, like a point mutation or deletion. It just mentions the absence of RecA. 

The rest of the paragraph discusses DNA repair pathways and structural changes but doesn't mention specific mutations beyond the recA gene. There's no mention of cDNA changes, protein changes, or other genetic variants. The focus is on the effect of Mn²⁺ on the bacteria's structure and repair mechanisms, not on specific mutations in genes.

So, the only mutation-related information is the recA-deficient mutants. The gene name is recA, but the exact mutation (like a point mutation, deletion, etc.) isn't specified. The description in the input context is "recA-deficient". Since the user wants specific details, and the text doesn't provide more, I should note that. 

The output should be in JSON format with the gene name and the variant. Since there's no cDNA or protein change details, those fields would be N.D. The description in the input context is "recA-deficient". 

I need to make sure that I'm not adding any information not present in the text. The answer should only include the recA gene and the deficiency, with the rest as N.D. because the text doesn't specify the exact mutation type.
