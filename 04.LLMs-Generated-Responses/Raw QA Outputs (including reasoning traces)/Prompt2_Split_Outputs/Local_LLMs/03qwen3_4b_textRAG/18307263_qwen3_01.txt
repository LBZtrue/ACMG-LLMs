Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a paragraph about PINK1 mutations in Parkinson's disease. I need to extract mutation details.

First, I'll look for mentions of mutations. The abstract says "compound heterozygous PINK1 mutations" and lists two specific mutations: p.A244G and p.V317I. 

The gene is PINK1. The variants are p.A244G and p.V317I. The description mentions these mutations abolish the protective effect of wild-type PINK1 against staurosporine-induced apoptosis. 

I need to structure this into the JSON format. Each variant should have cDNA and protein changes. However, the input text doesn't mention the cDNA positions explicitly. The protein changes are given as p.A244G and p.V317I. 

Wait, the example shows that if cDNA change isn't mentioned, it's "N.D." But here, the text only provides the protein changes. The original text says "Both mutations (p.A244G and p.V317I)" so the protein changes are there. The cDNA changes aren't specified, so I should put N.D. for cDNA. 

So the variants array will have two entries. Each with protein change and description. The cDNA change is N.D. for both. The gene is PINK1. 

Check if there's any other mutation info. The text also mentions "homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene", but the specific mutations are the two listed. 

No other mutations are mentioned. So the extracted info should include those two variants with their protein changes and the description from the text. 

Make sure the JSON is correctly formatted with the gene and variants. That's it.
