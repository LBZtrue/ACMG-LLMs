Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided abstract. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions that in familial forms of synucleinopathies, there are three human mutations in the a-synuclein gene. The mutations listed are A53T and A30P in a German kindred, and E46K in a Spanish family. 

So, the gene here is the a-synuclein gene. The mutations are A53T, A30P, and E46K. Each of these is a point mutation. The description in the input context is that these mutations are linked to autosomal dominant parkinsonian syndromes. 

I need to structure this into the JSON format. Each variant should have cDNA change and protein change. However, the original text doesn't specify the exact cDNA positions for these mutations. For example, A53T refers to a change at position 53 in the protein, but the cDNA change isn't explicitly given. The same goes for A30P and E46K. 

Since the text doesn't provide the cDNA positions, the "transcript" field should be "N.D." for each variant. The protein changes are directly given as A53T, A30P, E46K. The description in the input context is the mutation names as mentioned in the text. 

I need to make sure that each variant is listed, even if some details are missing. The user's example shows that if the cDNA change isn't present, it's set to N.D. So, I'll follow that. 

Therefore, the extracted information should include the gene name, the three variants with their respective protein changes, and the description. The cDNA changes are not specified, so they are marked as N.D. for each variant.
