Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation-related information. First, I need to read through the abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions "mutations in the N-terminus of the gene encoding α-synuclein (α-syn)" linked to autosomal dominant PD. Then it talks about a specific mutant A30P α-syn. The A30P is a mutation, so that's a key point. The gene is α-syn, so I need to note that. The cDNA change here is A30P, which is a point mutation. The protein change is also A30P, meaning the amino acid at position 30 is replaced from alanine to proline. The description in the context is "mutant A30P α-syn". 

Looking at the rest of the abstract, there's no mention of other mutations. The other parts discuss the effects of this mutation on dopamine levels and neurodegeneration, but the mutation itself is only A30P. The gene is α-syn, so that's the gene name. The cDNA change is A30P, but the transcript information isn't specified here. The example in the user's prompt had transcript as N.D. if not mentioned. Since the abstract doesn't mention the transcript variant, I should put N.D. for transcript. 

So the extracted information should include the gene as α-syn, the variant with cDNA change (A30P, position 30), protein change (A30P, position 30), and the description from the context. The rest of the details like the effect on dopamine are not mutation-related, so they can be ignored. The answer should be in the specified JSON format with "N.D." where applicable. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other mutations. The abstract only mentions A30P, so that's the only variant. Alright, that should be it.
