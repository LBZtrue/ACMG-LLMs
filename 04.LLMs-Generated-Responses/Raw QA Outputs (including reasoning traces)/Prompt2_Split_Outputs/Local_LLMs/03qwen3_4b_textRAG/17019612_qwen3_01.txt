Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided text. First, I need to read through the abstract and introduction carefully.

Looking at the abstract, there's mention of "Gly2385Arg" variant in LRRK2. The study talks about this as a putative risk factor for PD in the Chinese population from Taiwan. Also, in the case-control study, the heterozygous Gly2385Arg genotype was more common in PD patients. Then, in the functional studies, they discuss the effect of this variant on the protein's localization and toxicity under oxidative stress.

The introduction mentions LRRK2 (PARK8) mutations as the most frequent cause of familial PD. It also references the G2019S mutation, which is common in some populations. However, the user's text here is the abstract and introduction, so I need to check if those parts mention specific mutations.

In the abstract, the key mutation is Gly2385Arg. The G2019S is mentioned in the introduction as a common mutation, but the user's text here is the abstract and introduction. Wait, the user's input includes the abstract and the introduction part. The introduction says "The common G2019S mutation..." but the actual text provided in the user's input is the abstract and the introduction up to the mention of G2019S. However, the user's input text ends with "Lesage et al. , 2006;;Ozelius et al". So, the G2019S is mentioned in the introduction, but the main mutation discussed in the abstract is Gly2385Arg.

So, the task is to extract mutations. The Gly2385Arg is a missense variant in LRRK2. The G2019S is another mutation mentioned in the introduction. However, the user's text in the abstract and introduction includes both. But the user's instruction says to extract mutations from the paragraphs provided. The input text includes both the abstract and the introduction. The introduction mentions G2019S as a common mutation, but the abstract focuses on Gly2385Arg. However, the user's input text includes both, so I need to check both.

Wait, the user's input text includes the abstract and the introduction. The introduction says "The common G2019S mutation accounts for 3-7%..." but the abstract talks about Gly2385Arg. So, in the given text, there are two mutations: G2019S and Gly2385Arg. However, the user's text might not have the G2019S in the abstract, but in the introduction. The user's input includes the introduction, so I need to check if that's part of the text. The user's input text starts with the abstract and then the introduction. The introduction part says "Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2, PARK8) are the most frequent known cause... The common G2019S mutation..." So, that's part of the text.

Therefore, the mutations to extract are G2019S and Gly2385Arg. But wait, the abstract specifically mentions Gly2385Arg, and the introduction mentions G2019S. However, the user's input text includes both. So, the answer should include both. However, the user's example shows that if there are multiple mutations, they should be listed in the variants array.

But the user's input text is the abstract and the introduction. The abstract talks about Gly2385Arg, and the introduction mentions G2019S. Therefore, both should be extracted. But the user's example in the question shows that if there are multiple mutations, they are listed. However, in the given text, the G2019S is mentioned in the introduction, but the abstract is about Gly2385Arg. So, both are present. Therefore, the answer should include both. However, the user's input text may have the G2019S in the introduction, but the abstract is about Gly2385Arg. So, the answer should include both mutations.

So, the Gene is LRRK2, and the variants are G2019S and Gly2385Arg. Let me check the exact wording. The introduction says "The common G2019S mutation accounts for 3-7%..." and the abstract mentions "a common LRRK2 missense variant, Gly2385Arg, was independently detected as a putative risk factor for PD in the Chinese population from Taiwan."

So, both mutations are present. Therefore, the extracted information should include both. However, the user's input text may not have the G2019S in the abstract, but in the introduction. So, the answer should include both.

But the user's input text includes the introduction and the abstract. Therefore, both mutations are present. So, the answer should have both variants. However, the user's example shows that if there are multiple mutations, they are listed. Therefore, the JSON should have both.

Now, for the G2019S: the cDNA change is c.2019S? Wait, the G2019S is a common mutation. The cDNA change would be c.2019G>A, leading to p.G2019S. But in the text, it's mentioned as "G2019S mutation", so the cDNA change is c.2019G>A (assuming the position is 2019). However, the user's text may not specify the cDNA change, but in the example, they have cDNA change with position. But the text here says "G2019S" as a mutation. So, the cDNA change is c.2019G>A, and the protein change is p.G2019S. But the text may not specify the exact cDNA change, but the example shows that if the text says "G2019S", then the cDNA change is inferred as c.2019G>A. However, the user's instruction says to extract information directly from the text. The text says "G2019S mutation", so the cDNA change is not explicitly stated. However, in the example, the user's input mentions "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", so the cDNA change is explicitly stated. In this case, the text mentions "G2019S mutation" without specifying the cDNA change. Therefore, for the G2019S, the cDNA change is N.D. because it's not explicitly stated. However, the example shows that if the text says "G2019S", then the cDNA change is inferred. But the user's instruction says to extract only information directly from the text. Therefore, if the text doesn't mention the cDNA change, then it's N.D. Similarly for the protein change. However, the text does mention "G2019S" as the protein change. So, the protein change is p.G2019S. But the cDNA change is not specified. Therefore, for G2019S, the cDNA change is N.D., but the protein change is p.G2019S. Similarly, the Gly2385Arg is a missense variant, so the cDNA change is c.2385G>A, leading to p.G2385R. But the text says "Gly2385Arg", so the protein change is p.G2385R. The cDNA change is c.2385G>A. However, the text may not specify the cDNA change, but in the example, the cDNA change is given as c.248G>A. So, in this case, the text mentions "Gly2385Arg" as the variant, so the cDNA change is c.2385G>A. But the text may not specify that. Wait, the text says "Gly2385Arg" as a missense variant. The cDNA change would be c.2385G>A, leading to p.G2385R. However, the text doesn't explicitly state the cDNA change, but the protein change is given as Gly2385Arg. So, the cDNA change is not mentioned, so it's N.D. But the example shows that if the text says "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", then the cDNA change is extracted. However, in this case, the text says "Gly2385Arg" as the variant. The user's text may not have the cDNA change specified, so for that, the cDNA change is N.D., but the protein change is p.G2385R.

So, the answer would have two variants: G2019S and Gly2385Arg. For G2019S, the cDNA change is N.D. (since the text doesn't mention it), but the protein change is p.G2019S. For Gly2385Arg, the cDNA change is N.D. (since the text doesn't mention it), but the protein change is p.G2385R. However, the text does mention that the Gly2385Arg variant replaces glycine with arginine. So, the protein change is p.G2385R. But the cDNA change is not mentioned. Therefore, the cDNA change is N.D. for both variants. However, the example in the user's question includes the cDNA change as part of the variant, so if the text doesn't specify, it's N.D.

Therefore, the extracted information would be:

Gene: LRRK2

variants: 

- G2019S: cDNA change N.D., protein change p.G2019S, description "common G2019S mutation"

- Gly2385Arg: cDNA change N.D., protein change p.G2385R, description "Gly2385Arg variant"

But the text mentions that the Gly2385Arg is a missense variant. Also, the description in the input context is "Gly2385Arg variant".

So, the final answer should include both mutations, with their respective details.
