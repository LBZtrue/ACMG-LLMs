Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions three point mutations in αSyn associated with early-onset familial PD: A30P, E46K, and A53T. These are the mutations in question. The task is to extract details about these mutations. 

Looking at the structure, each mutation has a specific cDNA change and protein change. For example, A30P would correspond to a change in the amino acid at position 30 from Alanine to Proline. Similarly, E46K is Glutamic acid to Lysine at position 46, and A53T is Alanine to Threonine at position 53. 

The original text doesn't mention the exact cDNA changes, but the mutations are described as point mutations. Since the user's example includes cDNA changes, but in this case, the text doesn't specify the exact nucleotide changes, only the amino acid substitutions. So, the cDNA change would be N.D. for each, but the protein changes can be extracted. 

Wait, the example given in the user's instruction includes both cDNA and protein changes. However, in the provided text, the mutations are described as A30P, E46K, and A53T. These are the protein changes. The cDNA changes aren't specified here. So, for each mutation, the cDNA change is not mentioned, so we should put N.D. for that. 

The description in the input context is the mutation name itself, like A30P, etc. So the extracted information would have the Gene as αSyn, the variants with cDNA change N.D., protein changes as per the mutations, and the description as the mutation names. 

I need to make sure that all three mutations are included. The text says "Three point mutations in αSyn are associated with early-onset familial PD: A30P, E46K, and A53T." So each of these is a variant. 

Therefore, the JSON should have the Gene as αSyn, and each variant with cDNA change N.D., protein changes as per the mutations, and the description as the mutation names. 

I need to check if there's any other mutation information. The text also mentions that these mutations have different effects on amyloidogenicity and vesicle-binding activity, but that's not part of the mutation details. The user's task is to extract mutation-related info, so only the three mutations mentioned are relevant. 

So the final answer should include those three mutations with their respective protein changes and description, and cDNA changes as N.D. since they aren't specified in the text.
