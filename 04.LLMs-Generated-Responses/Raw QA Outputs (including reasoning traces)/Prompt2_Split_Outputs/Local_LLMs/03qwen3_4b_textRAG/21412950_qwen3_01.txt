Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation-related information. The role is to act as a medical literature data mining expert, so I need to carefully parse the text for any mentions of mutations.

First, I'll read through the abstract. The first sentence mentions that mutations in PINK1 cause recessive familial PD. Then, it talks about PINK1 gene structure. Later, it says "some evidences that help to explain the effect of some PD-related mutations in this protein's function." But the actual mutations aren't specified here. The abstract doesn't provide specific cDNA or protein changes, just mentions that mutations are associated with the disease.

Looking at the Introduction section, it lists genes related to PD, including PINK1. However, there's no specific mutation details given. The text mentions PINK1-related PD has atypical phenotypic characteristics, but again, no specific mutations are described. 

So, the key point is that the text does mention that mutations in PINK1 are associated with PD, but it doesn't specify any particular mutations (like cDNA changes or protein changes). The answer should reflect that. Since the user wants only mutation-related info, and there's no specific mutation details, the answer should be N.D. for all fields. But wait, the first part says mutations in PINK1 cause familial PD. Does that count as a mutation description? The problem is that the text doesn't list specific mutations, just the gene. So according to the constraints, if the text doesn't specify the exact mutations, then it's N.D. The example given in the user's prompt shows that if there's no specific mutation, it's N.D. So in this case, even though the gene is mentioned, the actual mutations aren't detailed. Therefore, the answer should be N.D. for all the fields.
