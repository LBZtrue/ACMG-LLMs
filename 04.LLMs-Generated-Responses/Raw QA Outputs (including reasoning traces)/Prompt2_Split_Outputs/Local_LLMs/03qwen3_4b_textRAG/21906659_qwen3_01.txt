Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided abstract. First, I'll read through the abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions "pathogenetic point mutation A30P" related to alpha synuclein. That's a mutation. The gene in question is alpha synuclein, so the gene name is α-syn. The mutation is A30P, which is a point mutation. The cDNA change would be A30P, but I need to check if there's more detail. The abstract says "A30P" is the mutation, so that's the protein change. The description in the context is "A30P" as the mutation. 

Looking for other mutations, the rest of the abstract talks about triplication of the α-syn gene, but that's about gene dosage, not a mutation. The other parts discuss effects of increasing expression, but no other mutations are mentioned. 

So the only mutation mentioned is A30P in the α-syn gene. The cDNA change is A30P, and the protein change is A30P. The description in the input context is "A30P". 

I need to structure this into the JSON format. The gene is α-syn, variants have cDNA and protein changes. The example shows that if there's no transcript information, it's N.D. Here, since the mutation is described as A30P, which is a point mutation, the cDNA change is A30P (position 30), and the protein change is A30P (position 30). The description is "A30P".

Wait, but the original text says "A30P" without specifying the exact position. However, in the example, they used position numbers. The abstract says "A30P" as the mutation. So maybe the position is 30. The cDNA change would be A30P, but the example shows that the cDNA change is in the format of cDNA with position. However, the original text doesn't specify the cDNA position, just the protein position. Hmm, but in the example, the protein change is position 83. So maybe here, the protein change is position 30. The cDNA change would be the same as the protein change if it's a point mutation. But the user's example shows that the cDNA change is c.248G>A, which is a specific position. However, in this case, the mutation is A30P, which is a point mutation in the protein. So the cDNA change would be the same as the protein change. But the original text doesn't specify the cDNA position, just the protein position. 

Wait, the original text says "A30P" as the mutation. So the protein change is A30P, position 30. The cDNA change would be the same, but without the position. However, the example shows that the cDNA change includes position. But the original text might not have that. The user's example includes the position, so maybe in this case, the cDNA change is not specified, so we put N.D. for the cDNA change. But the protein change is A30P, position 30. 

Alternatively, maybe the mutation is in the cDNA, so the cDNA change is A30P, and the protein change is the same. But the original text doesn't specify the position. However, the mutation is called A30P, which is a common way to denote the position. So the protein change is position 30, and the cDNA change is the same. But since the original text doesn't specify the cDNA position, maybe it's N.D. But the example includes the position. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the mutation is A30P in the protein, so the protein change is A30P, position 30. The cDNA change is not specified, so it's N.D. But the example shows that when the cDNA change is given, it's included. However, in the original text, the mutation is described as A30P, which is a point mutation. So the cDNA change would be the same as the protein change. But since the original text doesn't specify the position in the cDNA, maybe the cDNA change is N.D. But the example shows that the cDNA change is c.248G>A, which is a specific position. So in this case, the cDNA change is not provided, so it's N.D. But the protein change is A30P, position 30.

So the extracted information would be:

Gene: α-syn

variants: [
  {
    cDNA Change: { transcript: N.D., ref: N.D., alt: N.D., position: N.D. },
    Protein Change: { ref: A, alt: P, position: 30 },
    Description in input context: "A30P"
  }
]

But wait, the original text says "A30P" as the mutation. So the protein change is A30P, which is a substitution of amino acid at position 30. So the protein change is A to P at position 30. The cDNA change would be the same, but the original text doesn't specify the cDNA position. So in the example, they have the cDNA change as c.248G>A, which is a specific position. But here, the mutation is A30P, so the cDNA change is not specified, so it's N.D.

But the user's example includes the cDNA change as c.248G>A, which is a specific position. However, in the given text, the mutation is A30P, which is a point mutation, but the position in the cDNA is not given. So the answer would have the protein change with position 30, and the cDNA change as N.D.

But the user's example shows that when the mutation is described as c.248G>A (p.G83D), the cDNA change is that, and the protein change is the same. So in this case, the mutation is A30P, which is a protein change. Therefore, the cDNA change is not specified, so it's N.D. But the protein change is A30P, position 30.

So the final JSON would be:

{
  "Gene": "α-syn",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "N.D.",
        "ref": "N.D.",
        "alt": "N.D.",
        "position": "N.D."
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "A",
        "alt": "P",
        "position": "30"
      },
      "Description in input context": "A30P"
    }
  ]
}

But I need to check if the original text has any other mutations. The abstract also mentions triplication of the α-syn gene, but that's about gene dosage, not a mutation. So the only mutation is A30P.
