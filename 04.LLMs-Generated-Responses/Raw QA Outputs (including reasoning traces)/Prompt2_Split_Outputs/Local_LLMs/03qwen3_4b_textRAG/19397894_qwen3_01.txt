Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information following the specified JSON format.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. The abstract mentions mutations in LRRK2 related to Parkinson's disease. The specific mutations mentioned are I2020T and G2019S. 

Looking at the structure, the gene is LRRK2. The mutations are I2020T and G2019S. The cDNA changes aren't explicitly stated here, but the protein changes are given. The description in the context mentions these mutations in the activation loop of the kinase domain. 

The example given in the user's instruction includes cDNA and protein changes. However, in this case, the text doesn't specify the cDNA change, only the protein change. So for the cDNA change, I should put "N.D." as per the constraints. 

The protein changes are I2020T and G2019S. The positions are 2020 and 2019 respectively. The description in the input context is "I2020T and G2019S" for the mutations. 

The introduction part also mentions these mutations again, confirming their locations and their effects on kinase activity. 

So, the extracted information should include the gene as LRRK2, the variants with their protein changes, and the description from the input. The cDNA changes are not mentioned, so they are N.D. for both mutations. 

I need to make sure that each variant is in an array, with the correct fields. Also, check that all required fields are present, even if some are N.D. The output should be in the specified JSON format without any additional text.
