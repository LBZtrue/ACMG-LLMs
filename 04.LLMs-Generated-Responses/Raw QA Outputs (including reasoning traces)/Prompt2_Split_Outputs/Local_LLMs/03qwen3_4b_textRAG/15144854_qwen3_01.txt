Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions "mutations in the a-synuclein (a-syn) gene" leading to a familial parkinsonism syndrome. Then it talks about a case with the A53T a-syn gene mutation. The A53T is a specific mutation. 

So, the gene here is a-synuclein, which is also known as alpha-synuclein. The mutation is A53T. Let me check the details. The A53T mutation refers to a change in the amino acid at position 53 from Alanine (A) to Threonine (T). 

In the input text, the mutation is described as A53T. The cDNA change would be the nucleotide change that leads to this amino acid change. However, the abstract doesn't specify the exact cDNA change, only the protein change. Since the user's example includes both cDNA and protein changes, but here only the protein change is mentioned, I need to note that. The cDNA change is not provided, so I'll mark it as N.D. for transcript and the specific nucleotides. 

The description in the input context is "A53T a-syn gene mutation." So, the protein change is from Alanine to Threonine at position 53. 

I need to structure this into the JSON format. The gene is a-synuclein. The variants array should have one entry with the cDNA change as N.D. (since it's not specified), and the protein change as A to T at position 53. The description is "A53T a-syn gene mutation."

Wait, the example given by the user had the cDNA change as c.248G>A, but here, the abstract doesn't mention the cDNA change. So, the cDNA change fields for transcript, ref, alt, position would all be N.D. But the protein change is clear. 

So the final JSON should have the gene as a-synuclein, variants with one entry where cDNA change is N.D. and protein change is A to T at position 53. The description is as given in the input. 

I need to make sure that I'm not adding any information that isn't in the text. The abstract says "A53T a-syn gene mutation," so that's the key point. No other mutations are mentioned. Therefore, the answer should reflect that.
