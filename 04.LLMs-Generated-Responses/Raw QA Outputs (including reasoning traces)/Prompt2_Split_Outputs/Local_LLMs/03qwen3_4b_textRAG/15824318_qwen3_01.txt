Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information following the specified JSON format. First, I need to carefully read through the abstract and identify any mentions of mutations.

The abstract talks about PINK1 gene mutations, specifically G309D and L347P. The G309D mutation is described as stable and properly localized, while L347P is present in the Philippines. The study also examines the effects of these mutations on kinase activity and protein expression.

So, the genes involved are PINK1. The variants are G309D and L347P. For each, I need to extract cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. The cDNA changes for G309D would be G309D, but the position might be 309. Similarly, L347P is at position 347. The protein changes are straightforward: G to D and L to P. The descriptions mention that G309D is stable and properly localized, while L347P is destabilizing and reduces kinase activity.

I need to check if the cDNA positions are given. The original text mentions G309D and L347P, so the positions are 309 and 347 respectively. The protein changes are based on the amino acid substitutions. The descriptions in the input context are the exact phrases from the abstract: "G309D, which was originally reported to be stable and properly localized in cells" and "L347P, which is of interest because it is present at an appreciable carrier frequency in the Philippines."

I need to make sure that each variant is correctly structured in the JSON. Also, check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The second paragraph mentions PARK6 and Parkinson's disease, but that's about the gene and disease, not specific mutations. So the main mutations here are the two in PINK1.

No other mutations are present, so the variants array should have two entries. The gene is PINK1. The cDNA changes for G309D would be c.309G>D, but the original text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position. Wait, the original text says G309D, which is a single-letter change. But in the example, they have cDNA changes with positions. However, the example uses c.248G>A, which is a specific cDNA position. In this case, the abstract doesn't specify the cDNA position for G309D, only the amino acid position. So maybe the cDNA change is N.D. and the protein change is position 309. Wait, but the example includes both cDNA and protein changes. However, in the given text, the mutations are described as G309D and L347P, which are amino acid positions. But the example uses cDNA changes. Hmm, maybe the user expects that even if the cDNA position isn't given, we can note that as N.D. but the protein change is given. But the example shows that if the cDNA is not specified, it's N.D. However, in this case, the G309D is an amino acid change, so the cDNA change might not be provided. Wait, but in the example, the cDNA change is given as c.248G>A, which is a specific cDNA position. So in this case, the abstract doesn't mention the cDNA position for G309D, only the amino acid position. Therefore, the cDNA change should be N.D., and the protein change is position 309. But the example includes both. Maybe the user expects that if the cDNA position is not mentioned, it's N.D., but the protein change is given. So for G309D, the cDNA change is N.D., and the protein change is G309D. Wait, but the example shows that the cDNA change is c.248G>A, which is a specific cDNA position. However, in the given text, the mutations are described as G309D and L347P, which are amino acid positions, not cDNA positions. Therefore, the cDNA change for these would be N.D., and the protein change is G309D and L347P. But the example includes cDNA changes. Maybe the user is expecting that if the mutation is described as an amino acid change, then the cDNA change is N.D., but the protein change is given. Alternatively, maybe the cDNA change is inferred from the amino acid position. But in the example, the cDNA is given as c.248G>A, which is a specific cDNA position. So in this case, the abstract doesn't provide the cDNA position, only the amino acid position. Therefore, the cDNA change should be N.D., and the protein change is G309D and L347P.

So the JSON should have two variants. For G309D: cDNA change N.D., protein change G309D, description "G309D, which was originally reported to be stable and properly localized in cells". For L347P: cDNA change N.D., protein change L347P, description "L347P, which is of interest because it is present at an appreciable carrier frequency in the Philippines".

Wait, but the example includes cDNA changes even when they are not specified. So maybe in this case, since the abstract doesn't mention the cDNA position, we should put N.D. for cDNA change, but the protein change is given. Therefore, the answer should be structured accordingly.
