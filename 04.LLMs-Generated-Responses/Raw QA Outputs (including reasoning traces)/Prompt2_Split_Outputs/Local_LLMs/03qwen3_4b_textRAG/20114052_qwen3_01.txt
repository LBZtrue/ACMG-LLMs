Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions "the mutation site 46 linked to a familial form of PD (E46K)." So, that's a mutation. The gene here is α-synuclein, and the mutation is E46K. The E46K is a point mutation where glutamic acid is replaced by lysine at position 46. 

Now, checking the structure. The user wants the gene name, cDNA change, protein change, and description. The abstract doesn't specify the cDNA change directly, but the mutation is E46K, which is a protein change. The cDNA change would be based on the protein change. In the protein sequence, E46K would correspond to a cDNA change at position 46. However, the exact cDNA bases aren't given here. The abstract only mentions the mutation site 46, so maybe the cDNA change is N.D. since it's not explicitly stated. But wait, in the example, they had c.248G>A, which is a cDNA change. Here, the mutation is E46K, which is a protein change. The cDNA change would be the codon change that leads to E to K. But the abstract doesn't specify the exact nucleotide change, just the amino acid substitution. So, maybe the cDNA change is N.D. because it's not mentioned. However, in some cases, the position in the cDNA can be inferred. But since the abstract doesn't provide that, I should mark it as N.D.

So, the gene is α-synuclein. The protein change is E46K. The cDNA change is N.D. because the abstract doesn't specify the exact nucleotide change. The description in the input is "mutation site 46 linked to a familial form of PD (E46K)." So that's the description. 

I need to make sure there's no other mutation mentioned. The rest of the abstract talks about interactions with GM3, channels, etc., but no other mutations. So the only mutation is E46K in α-syn. Therefore, the JSON should have the gene as α-synuclein, the variants with cDNA change N.D., protein change E46K, and the description as given.
