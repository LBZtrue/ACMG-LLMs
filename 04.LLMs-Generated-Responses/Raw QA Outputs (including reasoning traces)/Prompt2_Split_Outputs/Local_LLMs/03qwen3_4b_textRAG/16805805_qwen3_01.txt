Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text from Valente et al. 2004b and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions "PINK1 gene mutations in PARK6-linked Parkinson's disease (PD)" right at the beginning. That's a key point. So the gene in question is PINK1. Now, the next part talks about PINK1 protein localizing to Lewy bodies. But the question is about mutations. The text says they identified PINK1 gene mutations in PARK6-linked PD. However, the rest of the text doesn't mention specific mutations like cDNA changes or protein changes. It discusses localization, proteasome inhibition, aggresomes, and some proteins involved in LBs, but no specific mutation details beyond the gene name.

So the only mutation-related info is the gene name PINK1 being associated with PARK6-linked PD. The rest of the text doesn't provide cDNA or protein changes. Therefore, according to the constraints, I should extract the gene name and note that the other fields are N.D. because there's no specific mutation description given. The example shows that if there's no cDNA or protein change, those fields are N.D. So the answer should have "Gene": "PINK1" and the variants array with one entry where cDNA and protein changes are N.D., and the description is the sentence from the text.
