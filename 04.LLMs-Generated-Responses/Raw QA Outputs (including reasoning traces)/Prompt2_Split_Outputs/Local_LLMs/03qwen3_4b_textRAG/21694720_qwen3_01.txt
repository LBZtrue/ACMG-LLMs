Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about Parkin and its mutations. The task is to extract mutation-related information.

First, I need to scan the abstract and introduction for any mentions of mutations. The abstract says, "Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism... is directly linked to mutations in the parkin gene." That's a key point. The gene is Parkin, and the mutations are associated with the disease.

Next, the text mentions that pathogenic Parkin mutations disrupt the autoinhibition, leading to a constitutively active molecule. But there's no specific mutation description like cDNA changes or protein changes here. The example given in the user's example includes details like cDNA and protein changes, but in this text, it's just stating that mutations are present without specifying the exact type.

So, the Gene is Parkin. The variants section would have "N.D." because there's no specific cDNA or protein change mentioned. The description in the input context is that the mutations are linked to the disease. 

I need to make sure I don't add any extra info not present. The answer should only include what's explicitly stated. The abstract mentions the gene but not the specific mutations beyond the fact that they're pathogenic. So the variants array would have one entry with N.D. for cDNA and protein changes, and the description as given.
