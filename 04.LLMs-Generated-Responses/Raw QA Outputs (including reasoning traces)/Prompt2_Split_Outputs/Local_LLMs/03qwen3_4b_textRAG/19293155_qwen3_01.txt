Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information following a specific JSON format. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any mutations mentioned.

The abstract talks about several mutations related to DJ-1 protein. The first one mentioned is the M26I mutation. Then there's the C106A mutation. Also, there are other mutations like C46A and C53A. The M26I is noted as a PD-associated mutation. 

I need to extract each of these mutations. For each, I should note the gene (DJ-1), the cDNA change, the protein change, and the description from the text. The cDNA changes are given as M26I, C106A, C46A, and C53A. However, the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA positions for all mutations. For example, M26I is a protein change, but the cDNA change would be based on the amino acid position. Wait, the text says "M26I mutation" which is a protein mutation. But in the example given, the cDNA change is specified. However, in this case, the text doesn't mention the exact cDNA position for M26I, only the protein change. So for cDNA change, maybe it's N.D. unless there's a specific position mentioned. 

Looking at the text again: "M26I mutation" is mentioned as a point mutation. The C106A is also a point mutation. The other mutations are C46A and C53A. The text says "C106A mutation of the central redox site specifically abolished binding..." So for C106A, the position is 106. For C46A and C53A, the positions are 46 and 53. The M26I is position 26. 

So for each mutation, the cDNA change would be the amino acid position. Wait, but in the example, the cDNA change is given as c.248G>A, which is a specific position. However, in the text here, the mutations are described as M26I, which is a protein change. But the cDNA change would correspond to that. However, the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position for M26I. The text says "M26I mutation" but doesn't mention the cDNA position. So for cDNA change, maybe it's N.D. unless there's a specific cDNA position given. 

Wait, the text says "M26I mutation reduces DJ-1 expression". The M26I is a point mutation in the DJ-1 protein. The example in the user's prompt shows that for a mutation like c.248G>A (p.G83D), the cDNA change is given with the position. But here, the text doesn't specify the cDNA position for M26I. However, in the context of the study, they might have the cDNA position. But the user's text doesn't mention it. So for the cDNA change, maybe it's N.D. for M26I, but for the others, like C106A, the position is 106. 

Wait, the text says "C106A mutation of the central redox site specifically abolished binding..." So that's a clear cDNA position. But for C46A and C53A, the positions are 46 and 53. The M26I is a protein change, but the text doesn't mention the cDNA position. So for the cDNA change, perhaps it's N.D. for M26I. 

So the variants would be:

- M26I: protein change is M26I. cDNA change is N.D. (since the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position, only the protein change). However, the text does mention that M26I is a point mutation, so maybe the cDNA change is M26I. But the example in the user's prompt shows that the cDNA change is given as c.248G>A, which is a specific position. However, in this case, the text doesn't provide the cDNA position for M26I. Therefore, the cDNA change for M26I would be N.D. 

Alternatively, maybe the M26I is a protein change, and the cDNA change would be based on the amino acid position. But the problem is that the cDNA change is typically a nucleotide change, not an amino acid change. So the cDNA change would be the actual nucleotide position. However, the text here does not specify that. Therefore, for M26I, the cDNA change is N.D. 

So the variants would be:

1. M26I: cDNA change N.D., protein change M26I, description "M26I mutation reduces DJ-1 expression, particularly in a null background... homozygous M26I mutation causes loss of DJ-1 protein."

2. C106A: cDNA change C106A, protein change C106A, description "C106A mutation of the central redox site specifically abolished binding to ASK1 and the cytoprotective activity of DJ-1."

3. C46A: cDNA change C46A, protein change C46A, description "mutations of peripheral redox sites (C46A and C53A) and M26I also led to constitutive ASK1 binding."

4. C53A: cDNA change C53A, protein change C53A, description same as above.

But wait, the text says "mutations of peripheral redox sites (C46A and C53A) and M26I also led to constitutive ASK1 binding." So the C46A and C53A are separate. So each of these would be individual entries.

So the JSON should have four variants. The M26I is a PD-associated mutation. The C106A is another. The C46A and C53A are peripheral.

So the final JSON would include these four variants, with the cDNA changes for C106A, C46A, C53A, and N.D. for M26I. The description for each would be the exact text from the input.
