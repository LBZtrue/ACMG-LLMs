Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information following the specified JSON format.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. The main focus is on mutations in the PARK7/DJ1 gene. The key mutations mentioned are c.192G>A (p.E64D) and another one, L166P. The patient has a mutation in DJ1, and there's also a mention of the sister and brother with different genotypes.

Looking for gene names: DJ1 is the gene here. The cDNA changes are c.192G>A and L166P. The protein changes are p.E64D and p.L166P. The description in the context includes the c.192G>A (p.E64D) and the L166P mutation. 

I need to check if there are any other mutations. The text mentions "a third mutation, c.192G4C (p.E64D)" which seems like a typo, but the correct one is c.192G>A. Then the L166P is mentioned as a recently described mutation. 

Also, the abstract talks about the E64D mutation not altering the structure but showing decreased protein levels and nuclear localization. The L166P is another mutation. 

So the variants should be two: one is c.192G>A (p.E64D) and the other is c.L166P (p.L166P). The description for E64D includes the functional significance, while L166P is mentioned as a recently described mutation. 

Need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with Gene as DJ1, and each variant having the cDNA and protein changes. The description in the input context should include the exact text from the abstract. 

Check if there are any other mutations. The text also mentions the patient's sister and brother, but that's about the inheritance and clinical effects, not the mutations themselves. So the only mutations are the two mentioned. 

Make sure to use N.D. for any missing fields, but in this case, all necessary fields are present. The answer should be in the specified JSON format with the correct gene, variants, and their details.
