Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions two mutations: A30P and A53T. Both are linked to Parkinson's disease. The A30P mutant is discussed in detail, showing defective membrane binding. The A53T is also mentioned as a naturally occurring substitution with normal membrane activity. There's also a double mutant A53T/A30P, which inherits the defect from A30P.

Now, I need to structure this into the JSON format. The gene here is a-Synuclein, so the Gene field should be "a-Synuclein". The variants are A30P and A53T. For each, I need to extract the cDNA change and protein change. However, the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA positions. The A30P mutation is described as a proline mutation at position 30, so the protein change is p.A30P. Similarly, A53T is p.A53T. The cDNA changes aren't given, so those would be N.D. The description in the context is "A30P" and "A53T".

Wait, the example uses "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" as an example. But in this case, the text doesn't mention the cDNA position. The mutation is described as A30P and A53T, which are single amino acid substitutions. So the cDNA change is not provided, so I should put N.D. for that. The protein change is straightforward. The description in the input context is the mutation name itself.

So the variants array should have two entries. Each with cDNA change as N.D., protein change as p.A30P and p.A53T respectively, and the description as the mutation name. Also, the double mutant is mentioned, but the user's example doesn't include that. Wait, the question says to extract mutations mentioned. The double mutant is A53T/A30P, but the user's example doesn't include that. However, the problem statement says to extract mutations, so maybe that's a separate variant. But in the input text, the double mutant is described as showing defective binding similar to A30P. However, the mutation itself is the combination of A53T and A30P. So perhaps that's another variant. But the original question is about mutations in the text. The text mentions A30P and A53T as mutations. The double mutant is a combination of both. But the user's example includes a single mutation. So maybe the double mutant is not a separate variant here. The text says "A53T/A30P a-Syn" but the mutations are A30P and A53T. So in the variants, we have the two single mutations. The double mutant is a combination, but the user's example doesn't include that. The user's example only includes single mutations. So perhaps the answer should only include A30P and A53T as separate variants.

So the JSON should have two variants: A30P and A53T. The cDNA change is N.D. for both, as the text doesn't specify. The protein changes are p.A30P and p.A53T. The description in the input is "A30P" and "A53T" respectively. The double mutant is mentioned, but since it's a combination, maybe it's not a separate variant. The user's example only includes single mutations, so I think that's the case here.

Therefore, the final JSON should have Gene as "a-Synuclein", variants with two entries, each with cDNA change N.D., protein changes as p.A30P and p.A53T, and the description as the mutation name.
