Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions a patient with early-onset Parkinsonism carrying a homozygous W437X nonsense mutation in the PINK1 gene. That's a key point. The gene is PINK1, and the mutation is W437X. The term "nonsense mutation" indicates a stop codon, which would lead to a truncated protein. The mutation is homozygous, meaning both copies of the gene are mutated.

Now, I need to check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The rest of the abstract talks about mitochondrial function, cytochrome c levels, ROS production, etc. But no other genes or mutations are discussed. The introduction part mentions PINK1 mutations as the second most common cause of ARP, but that's general info, not specific to the patient's case.

So the main mutation here is PINK1 with the W437X nonsense mutation. The cDNA change is W437X. Since it's a nonsense mutation, the protein change would be a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. The description in the context is "W437X nonsense mutation in the PINK1 gene".

I need to structure this into the JSON format. The gene is PINK1. The variants array should have one entry. The cDNA change: position is 437, ref is W, alt is X. The protein change: position 437, ref W, alt stop (since it's a nonsense mutation). The description is "W437X nonsense mutation in the PINK1 gene".

I should make sure there's no other mutation mentioned. The rest of the text doesn't talk about other genes or mutations. So the answer should only include this one variant. Also, check if the position is correct. The mutation is in the PINK1 gene, so the position is 437. The cDNA change is W437X, which is a nonsense mutation, so the protein change is a stop at position 437. The description is as given in the context.

No other genes or mutations are present. So the JSON should reflect that. The other parts of the abstract don't mention any other mutations, so the answer is correct.
