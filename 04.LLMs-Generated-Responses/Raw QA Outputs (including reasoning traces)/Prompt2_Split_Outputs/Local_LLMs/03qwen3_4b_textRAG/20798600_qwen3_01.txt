Okay, let's start by reading the provided text carefully. The user is asking for mutation information from the given paragraph. The main topic is about Parkinson's disease (PD) and mitochondrial dysfunction, focusing on the genes PINK1 and Parkin. The paragraph mentions that mutations in both genes are implicated in cellular dysfunctions related to neurodegeneration.

Looking for specific mutation details, the text states: "pD-associated parkin mutations interfere with the process of mitophagy at distinct steps." It also mentions "disease-associated piNK1 mutations also compromise the selective degradation of depolarized mitochondria." However, the text doesn't specify the exact mutations, like cDNA changes or protein positions. It only refers to the presence of mutations in these genes without providing detailed genetic or amino acid changes.

The example given in the user's prompt includes specific cDNA and protein changes, but in this case, the text doesn't have those details. Instead, it talks about the effect of mutations on the process of mitophagy. Since there's no mention of specific mutations (like c.248G>A or p.G83D), the answer should indicate that the mutation information isn't present. 

Therefore, the correct response is to return "N.D." for all fields since the text doesn't specify the exact mutations, only that mutations exist in the genes PINK1 and Parkin. The key point here is that the user's query requires explicit mutation details, which aren't provided in the text.
