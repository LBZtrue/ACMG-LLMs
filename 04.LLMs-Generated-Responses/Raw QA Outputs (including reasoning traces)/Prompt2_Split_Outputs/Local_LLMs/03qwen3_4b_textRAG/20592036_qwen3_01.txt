Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically focusing on extracting mutation information from the given text.

First, I'll read through the provided abstract carefully. The main topic is α-synuclein (αS) and its mutations related to Parkinson's disease. The key points mentioned are three point mutations leading to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism. The text also discusses the structural changes in αS, but the focus here is on the mutations.

I need to identify if there are any specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, or descriptions of mutations. The text mentions "three αS point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism." However, it doesn't specify the exact mutations like c.248G>A or p.G83D. The mutations are referred to generally as "three known PD-linked mutations," but the actual names or positions aren't given here. 

Looking at the example provided, the user expects specific details like gene name, cDNA change, protein change, and description. In this case, the text doesn't provide the exact mutations' positions or sequences. It only states that there are three mutations linked to PD. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the mutation information isn't detailed enough. 

The constraints say to return "N.D." for any information not mentioned. Since the exact mutations aren't specified in the text, the extracted information would have "N.D." for all fields. The gene is αS, but the variants section would be N.D. because the specific mutations aren't described. 

So the final JSON should have the gene as α-synuclein, and the variants array with N.D. for each field since the text doesn't provide the specific mutations. The description in the input context would also be N.D. because the exact mutations aren't mentioned.
