Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided text. First, I'll read through the context carefully.

The abstract mentions that three missense mutations for a-Syn are associated with familial PD: A30P, A53T, and E46K. These are all point mutations, so I need to note the gene name (a-Syn), the specific changes. Each mutation has a cDNA change and a protein change. The text doesn't specify the exact positions in the cDNA, but the mutations are given as A30P, A53T, E46K. 

Wait, the user's example uses cDNA positions, but in the input text, the mutations are written as A30P, etc. The original text doesn't mention the exact cDNA positions, so for the cDNA change, the position is N.D. unless specified. The protein change is the amino acid substitution. 

So, the three mutations are A30P, A53T, E46K. Each of these would be in the variants array. The gene is alpha-synuclein. The description in the input context is the mutation names as given. 

I need to check if the text mentions anything else. The rest of the text talks about the effects of these mutations in the context of PD, but the actual mutation details are those three. The user's example shows that even if the cDNA position isn't given, it's N.D., but the protein change is there. 

So the answer should list these three mutations with their respective protein changes and the description. The cDNA changes are N.D. since the text doesn't specify the exact positions. The gene is a-Syn. 

I need to make sure that the JSON structure is correct, with the gene name and the variants array. Each variant has the cDNA change (with N.D. for positions), protein change, and the description. 

No other mutations are mentioned, so that's all. The answer should be the three variants as described.
