Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided text. First, I'll read through the context carefully.

The abstract mentions disease-associated mutations: R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T. These are all point mutations. I need to parse each of them. 

Starting with R1441C. The notation is usually written as a single-letter code, so the gene is LRRK2. The cDNA change would be R1441C, but wait, in the example, they split into cDNA and protein. However, the input here doesn't specify if it's a cDNA change or a protein change. Wait, the example given in the problem uses c.248G>A, which is cDNA, and p.G83D for the protein. But in the text here, the mutations are written as R1441C, which is a protein change. So maybe the cDNA change isn't provided here. But the problem says to extract if possible. 

Wait, the original text says: "The disease-associated mutations, R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T, exhibited reduced interaction with, and phosphorylation of, Akt1..." So these are mutations in the LRRK2 gene. The notation is R1441C, which is a single-letter change. The position is 1441, and the residue is R to C. Similarly for the others. 

So for each mutation, the gene is LRRK2. The protein changes are R1441C, G2019S, I2020T. The cDNA change isn't specified here, so maybe they are not provided. But the example includes cDNA changes, so maybe in this case, since the text doesn't mention cDNA, we should mark it as N.D. for cDNA change. 

So the extracted information would have the gene as LRRK2, and each variant would have the protein change, with cDNA as N.D. The description in the input is the mutation names given. 

Check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The text also mentions that these mutations are associated with LRRK2, so the gene is correct. 

So the JSON should have the gene as LRRK2, variants with their respective protein changes, and cDNA as N.D. for each. The description in the input is the exact mutation names. 

I need to make sure that all three mutations are listed. The answer should include all three variants. 

So the final JSON should reflect that.
