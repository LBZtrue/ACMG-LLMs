Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract about DJ-1 mutations in Parkinson's disease. My task is to extract mutation-related information following the specified JSON format.

First, I need to scan the text for any mentions of mutations. The abstract lists five mutations: L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A. Each of these is associated with DJ-1. The gene in question here is DJ-1, so that's the gene name.

Next, I need to parse each mutation. For each, I should extract the cDNA change and protein change. However, the original text doesn't mention cDNA positions or transcript information. The mutations are given as single-letter changes, like L166P. The "L166P" refers to the amino acid change at position 166, where leucine is replaced by proline. But the text doesn't specify the cDNA position, so for the cDNA change, the transcript field should be "N.D." and the position is missing. However, the protein change is clear: the amino acids at position 166 are altered from L to P.

Looking at the example provided, the user expects the cDNA change and protein change. Since the original text doesn't provide cDNA positions, those fields should be "N.D." except for the protein change. The description in the input context is the mutation name itself, like "L166P".

So for each mutation, the "cDNA Change" will have "N.D." for transcript, ref, alt, and position. The "Protein Change" will have the specific amino acids. The description in the input is the mutation name.

Wait, the example shows that for cDNA changes, if the position is given, it's included. But in this case, the text doesn't mention cDNA positions. The mutations are described as amino acid changes, so the cDNA change isn't provided. Therefore, the cDNA change fields should be "N.D." and the protein change is the actual mutation.

So for each of the five mutations, I need to list them with their respective protein changes. The E64D is mentioned as nearly unperturbed, but the mutation itself is still present. The other three mutants (M26I, A104T, D149A) have different structural perturbations. The description in the input context is the mutation name.

So the JSON structure should have the gene as DJ-1, and each variant with their cDNA and protein changes. Since cDNA information isn't present, those are N.D. The protein changes are the amino acid substitutions. The description is the mutation name.

I need to make sure that all five mutations are included, even if some have the same structure. The answer should list all five, each with their respective details. The example shows that even if the same mutation is mentioned multiple times, they are listed as separate entries. But in this case, each mutation is unique.

Therefore, the final JSON should have the gene as DJ-1, and each variant with their cDNA (N.D.) and protein changes, along with the description from the input.
