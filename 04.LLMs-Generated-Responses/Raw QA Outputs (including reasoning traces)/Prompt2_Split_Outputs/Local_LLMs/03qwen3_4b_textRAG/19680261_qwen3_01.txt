Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information following the specified JSON format.

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main focus is on DJ-1 and its mutations related to Parkinson's disease. The key mutations mentioned are D149A and L166P. 

Starting with the D149A mutation: The text says that this mutation renders DJ-1 resistant to caspase-6 proteolysis and abolishes its protective phenotype. The cDNA change here is D149A, which translates to a protein change where aspartic acid at position 149 is replaced by alanine. The description in the context is "D149A".

Next, the L166P mutation: It prevents DJ-1 dimerization but doesn't impair caspase-6 proteolysis. The cDNA change is L166P, leading to a protein change where leucine at position 166 is replaced by proline. The description in the context is "L166P".

I need to check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The abstract also mentions "early-onset PD-associated mutation (D149A)" and "L166P mutation". These are the two mutations discussed. There's no mention of other mutations, so the rest should be N.D.

Now, structuring the JSON. The gene is DJ-1. The variants array should include both mutations. Each variant has cDNA change and protein change. The description in the input context is the exact mutation name from the text.

I need to make sure that all fields are present. For cDNA change, the transcript is N.D. since it's not specified. The ref and alt are the original and mutated bases. Position is given as 149 for D149A and 166 for L166P. For the protein change, ref and alt are the amino acids, and position is the number. The description in the input context is the full mutation name.

No other mutations are present, so the rest of the fields are N.D. as per the constraints. Double-checking the example provided to ensure the format matches exactly. Looks good. No errors in the extraction. The answer should be in the correct JSON structure as specified.
