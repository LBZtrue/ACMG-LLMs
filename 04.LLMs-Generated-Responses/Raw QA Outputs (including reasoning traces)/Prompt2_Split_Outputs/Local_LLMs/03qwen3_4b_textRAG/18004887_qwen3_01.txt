Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph about parkin mutations and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions two mutations: K48A and R42P in the parkin Ubld. The gene here is parkin, so that's the gene name. The cDNA changes are specified as K48A and R42P. For each, I need to break down the cDNA and protein changes. 

Looking at K48A: the cDNA change is K48A. The protein change is replacing lysine (K) with alanine (A) at position 48. The description in the context says "K48A mutation" and "R42P mutation". 

For R42P: the cDNA change is R42P, which translates to replacing arginine (R) with proline (P) at position 42. The context mentions "R42P in parkin's Ubld".

I need to check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The text also talks about the K48A mutation having little effect on stability, and R42P causing poor expression and degradation. But the main mutations are those two. 

No other genes are mentioned besides parkin. The variants are only the two mutations. The description in the context for each is the mutation name. 

So the JSON should have the gene as parkin, two variants, each with their cDNA and protein changes, and the description. Make sure to use N.D. where not applicable, but in this case, all necessary info is present. No other mutations are mentioned, so that's it.
