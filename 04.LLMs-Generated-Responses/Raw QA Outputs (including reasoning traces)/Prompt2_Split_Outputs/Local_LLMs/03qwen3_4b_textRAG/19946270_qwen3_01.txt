Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about PARK2 mutations in both Parkinson's disease and cancer. I need to extract mutation-related information.

First, I'll scan through the abstract and main sections. The abstract mentions "inactivating somatic mutations" and "frequent intragenic deletions" of PARK2 in cancer. Also, it says the mutations occur in the same domains and residues as germline mutations causing familial PD. The main section talks about germline mutations in PARK2 leading to early-onset PD, and cancer-specific mutations abrogating PARK2's function.

Looking for gene names, the gene is PARK2. The cDNA changes aren't specified here, but there's mention of mutations in the same domains and residues. The protein changes are about E3 ligase activity being compromised, leading to mitotic instability. The description in the input context includes "inactivating somatic mutations" and "frequent intragenic deletions."

Since there's no specific cDNA or protein position given, like in the example, I'll note that. The key points are the gene, the type of mutations (somatic, intragenic deletions), and the effect on the protein's function. The description in the input context would be the sentences mentioning the mutations in cancer and their effects.

So, the extracted info should have PARK2 as the gene, variants with cDNA changes as N.D. since positions aren't given, protein changes as N.D., but the description includes the inactivating mutations and deletions. Also, the germline mutations are mentioned, but the user's goal is to extract mutations from the text. The main text mentions both germline and somatic, but the question is about the input text. The answer should include both, but since the user's example only includes one, maybe only the ones in the text. Wait, the user's example includes both types, but in the given text, the mutations are in the same domains and residues as germline. But the text says "cancer-specific mutations" which are inactivating. So the variants would be the somatic ones, but without specific positions. Therefore, the answer should have the gene as PARK2, variants with cDNA and protein as N.D., but the description includes the inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic deletions. Also, the germline mutations are mentioned, but the user's example only includes one variant. So maybe the answer should include both types, but since the text says "the same domains, and sometimes at the same residues," but no specific positions. So the answer would have the gene, variants with N.D., and the description as per the text.
