Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions "A53T substitution" and "S87N substitutions". These are specific mutations. Let me break them down. The A53T refers to a change at position 53 in the protein, where Alanine (A) is replaced by Threonine (T). The S87N is a substitution at position 87, with Serine (S) turned into Asparagine (N). 

Looking at the structure of the answer, I need to map these into the JSON format. The gene in question here is α-synuclein, but the abstract doesn't specify the gene name. However, the mutations are in the α-synuclein protein, so the gene would be "α-synuclein" or maybe "SNCA". Wait, the example used "TP53" as the gene name. But in the context, the text refers to α-synuclein, so the gene is α-synuclein. However, sometimes the gene is called SNCA. But the abstract doesn't mention the gene symbol, so maybe it's better to use the protein name as the gene here. Or maybe the user expects the gene name as "SNCA". Hmm, but the example used "TP53" as the gene, so perhaps in this case, the gene is "α-synuclein". 

Wait, the abstract says "the A53T substitution" and "S87N substitutions". The positions are in the protein, so the gene is α-synuclein. The cDNA changes would be based on the amino acid positions. The A53T is a single nucleotide change leading to a different amino acid. The S87N is another. 

So for each variant, the cDNA change would be inferred. But the abstract doesn't specify the exact cDNA positions. However, the amino acid positions are given. The example in the user's question used the protein change with positions. But the user's example had cDNA changes. However, in the given abstract, the mutations are described in terms of amino acid substitutions, not cDNA. So maybe the cDNA change is not provided, so we have to note that as N.D. 

Wait, the example shows that if the cDNA change is not mentioned, it's N.D. So in this case, the abstract mentions the amino acid substitutions (A53T and S87N), but not the specific cDNA changes. Therefore, the cDNA change would be N.D., but the protein change would be the positions and the amino acids. 

So the extracted information should include the gene as "α-synuclein", the variants with their protein changes, and the description from the input. The cDNA changes are not mentioned, so they are N.D. 

Let me check the example again. The example had a cDNA change and a protein change. In this case, the abstract only mentions the protein changes, so the cDNA change is N.D. But the user's instruction says to extract only mutation-related info. Since the abstract mentions the substitutions, which are in the protein, the protein change is present. 

Therefore, the answer should have the gene as "α-synuclein", the variants with their protein changes (A53T and S87N), and the description from the input. The cDNA changes are N.D. because they aren't specified in the text.
