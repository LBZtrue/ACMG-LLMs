Okay, let me start by carefully reading the provided text to identify any mutation-related information. The user is asking for mutations related to LRRK2, so I'll focus on that gene.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions "Y1699C" and "G2019S" mutants. These are specific mutations. The introduction also refers to "Y1699C" and "R1441C" as mutant genes. The abstract states that these mutants result in the loss of protection from oxidative stress compared to wild-type LRRK2.

I need to extract the gene name, which is LRRK2. The variants are Y1699C and G2019S. The introduction also mentions R1441C, but the abstract only talks about Y1699C and G2019S. The description in the context says that these mutants are linked to parkinsonian symptoms. 

For each variant, I need to note the cDNA change and protein change. Y1699C would be c.1699Y>C (assuming the position is 1699, but the original text might have different notation). Wait, the original text says Y1699C. In standard notation, that's a single nucleotide change where the original is Y (cytosine) and it's changed to C (adenine?), but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Wait, the original text says "Y1699C" and "G2019S". Let me check again. Oh, in the abstract, it says "Y1699C or G2019S mutants". So Y1699C is a mutation where the amino acid at position 1699 is changed from Y to C. But in standard notation, that would be c. something. However, the text doesn't provide the exact cDNA position. Wait, the example given in the user's example uses c.248G>A, which is a cDNA change. But in the current text, the mutations are described as Y1699C and G2019S. The problem is that the text doesn't specify the cDNA position, only the amino acid change. So for the cDNA change, since it's not provided, I should mark it as N.D. But the example shows that if the cDNA change is not given, it's N.D. However, the user's example includes cDNA change as N.D. if not present. Wait, in the example given by the user, the input text has "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", so the cDNA change is provided. In the current text, the mutations are described as Y1699C and G2019S, which are amino acid changes. The cDNA change is not specified, so for the cDNA change, it's N.D. But the protein change is Y1699C and G2019S. However, the original text might have different notation. Wait, in the abstract, the mutations are Y1699C and G2019S. The example uses "p.G83D" for the protein change. So in this case, the protein change is Y1699C and G2019S. The cDNA change is not provided, so it's N.D. But wait, maybe the cDNA position is inferred from the amino acid position. But the text doesn't state that. Therefore, according to the constraints, if the cDNA change is not mentioned, it's N.D. Similarly, the description in the input context would be "expression of wild-type LRRK2 but not Y1699C or G2019S mutants..." and "loss of basal cell viability in SHSY5Y cells (Greggio et al., 2006;West et al., 2005) demonstrating their innate toxicity."

So for the variants, the first variant is Y1699C, the second is G2019S. The description in the input context mentions that these mutants are linked to parkinsonian symptoms. The introduction also mentions that these mutants are linked to the onset of parkinsonian symptoms. So the description in the input context would be "linked to the onset of parkinsonian symptoms" and "result in a loss of basal cell viability".

So the JSON should have the gene as LRRK2, variants with cDNA as N.D., protein changes as Y1699C and G2019S, and the description in the input context as "linked to the onset of parkinsonian symptoms" and "result in a loss of basal cell viability in SHSY5Y cells".

Wait, the user's example includes multiple variants. So in this case, there are two variants: Y1699C and G2019S. Each would be a separate entry in the variants array. The description in the input context would be the text that describes the mutation, which in the abstract is "expression of wild-type LRRK2 but not Y1699C or G2019S mutants enhanced the tolerance...". Also, in the introduction, "expression of LRRK2 mutant genes, such as Y1699C and R1441C, result in a loss of basal cell viability...". So the description in the input context should include both the abstract and the introduction mentions.

Therefore, the extracted information should include both Y1699C and G2019S as variants, each with their protein changes, and the description in the input context would be the text that describes the mutations, which includes both the abstract and the introduction mentions.
