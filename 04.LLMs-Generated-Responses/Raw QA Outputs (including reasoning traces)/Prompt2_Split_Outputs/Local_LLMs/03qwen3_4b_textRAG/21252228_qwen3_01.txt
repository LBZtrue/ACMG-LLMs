Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about Parkinson's disease, focusing on α-synuclein and mitochondrial dysfunction. They want me to extract mutation information.

First, I'll scan through the abstract and the subsequent paragraphs. The main topic is about how α-synuclein accumulation leads to autophagy activation, which in turn affects mitochondria. The key part here is the mention of "mutant A53T α-synuclein." That's a specific mutation. 

Looking at the details: A53T is a mutation in the α-synuclein gene. The "A53T" part refers to the amino acid change from Alanine (A) to Threonine (T) at position 53. The gene here is SNCA, which is the gene encoding α-synuclein. 

The rest of the text talks about mitochondrial dysfunction and other genes like Parkin, Mitofusin 2, Dynamin-related protein 1, but those are not mutations in the sense of genetic variants. They're proteins involved in the process, but the question is about mutations. 

So, the only mutation mentioned is the A53T in SNCA. The other genes mentioned (Parkin, Mitofusin 2, etc.) are not described as mutated here. The text doesn't mention any other mutations. 

I need to make sure that the extracted information is accurate. The cDNA change isn't specified here, but the protein change is clear. The description in the input context is "mutant A53T α-synuclein." 

So the JSON should have the gene as SNCA, the variant with the protein change A53T, and the description. Since there's no cDNA change mentioned, the transcript field is N.D. The rest of the fields are filled accordingly. 

No other mutations are present, so the answer should only include this one variant.
