Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation-related information. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions "pathogenic C-and N-terminal parkin mutants" and discusses different mutations. Specifically, it talks about deletion of the C terminus leading to misfolding and aggregation. Then there are four N-terminal missense mutations in the UBL domain that decrease parkin stability, causing rapid proteasome degradation. Also, a 42 kDa parkin species is mentioned, originating from an internal start site without the N-terminal UBL domain.

So, the genes involved here are parkin. The mutations are described as C-terminal deletions and N-terminal missense mutations in the UBL domain. The cDNA changes aren't explicitly mentioned, but the description says "deletion of the C terminus" and "four N-terminal missense mutations." The protein changes are misfolding, aggregation, and degradation. The 42 kDa species is a result of an internal start site, which might be a different type of mutation, but the text doesn't specify a cDNA change for that. 

I need to check if the cDNA changes are mentioned. The text says "deletion of the C terminus" which is a deletion, but the exact position isn't given. The N-terminal missense mutations are in the UBL domain, but again, the specific positions aren't provided. The 42 kDa species is due to an internal start site, which could be a different kind of mutation, but the text doesn't mention a specific cDNA change for that. 

So, the main mutations are the C-terminal deletion and the four N-terminal missense mutations in the UBL domain. The description in the input context for the C-terminal deletion is "deletion of the C terminus," and for the N-terminal mutations, it's "four N-terminal missense mutations, located within the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), decrease the stability of parkin; as a consequence, these mutants are rapidly degraded by the proteasome." 

The 42 kDa species is a result of an internal start site, but that's more about the protein's structure rather than a mutation in the gene. However, the user's example includes cDNA changes, so maybe I should note that. But the text doesn't specify a cDNA change for the 42 kDa species. 

So, the extracted information should include the gene as parkin, the variants with cDNA changes (if any), protein changes, and descriptions. The C-terminal deletion is a deletion, but no specific position. The N-terminal missense mutations are in the UBL domain, but no specific positions. The 42 kDa species is a different aspect, but the text doesn't mention a mutation there. 

Therefore, the answer should list the C-terminal deletion and the four N-terminal missense mutations in the UBL domain. The cDNA changes for the C-terminal deletion are not specified, so "N.D." for position. The N-terminal mutations are missense, but positions aren't given. The description for each variant should be as per the text.
