Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided abstract. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions several DJ-1 mutants: L166P, M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S. Each of these is a mutation in the DJ-1 gene. The task is to extract gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

Starting with L166P: The cDNA change isn't explicitly stated here, but the protein change is L166P. Since the abstract doesn't mention the specific cDNA change, I'll note that as N.D. for the transcript. However, the protein change is clear: leucine to proline at position 166.

Next, M26I: Similarly, the cDNA change isn't given, so transcript is N.D. The protein change is methionine to isoleucine at position 26.

R98Q: Again, no cDNA info, so transcript N.D. Protein change is arginine to glutamine at 98.

D149A: Same pattern. Transcript N.D., protein change is aspartic acid to alanine at 149.

C106S: Again, transcript N.D., protein change is cysteine to serine at 106.

The abstract also mentions that these mutants are derived from homozygous mutations, but the specific cDNA changes aren't provided. So for each variant, the cDNA change is N.D., but the protein changes are listed. 

I need to make sure that each variant is included in the variants array. The description in the input context is the mutation name as mentioned in the text. 

No other mutations are mentioned, so the answer should include all these variants with their respective protein changes and N.D. for cDNA changes. The gene is DJ-1 throughout. 

I should check if there's any other mutation mentioned. The abstract also talks about D149A, which is included. The C106S is mentioned as a mutant for protease activity. 

So the final JSON should have DJ-1 as the gene, and each variant with their protein changes and descriptions. All cDNA changes are N.D. because they aren't specified in the text.
