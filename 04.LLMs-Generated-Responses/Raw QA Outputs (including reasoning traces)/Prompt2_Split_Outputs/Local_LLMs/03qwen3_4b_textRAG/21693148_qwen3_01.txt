Okay, let's start by carefully reading the provided text to identify any mutation-related information. The user is asking for mutations related to UCH-L1 and other proteins mentioned in the context of Parkinson's disease.

First, looking at the abstract and introduction. The main focus is on UCH-L1 mutations. The abstract mentions a mutation in UCH-L1 associated with familial Parkinson's disease: "a mutation in UCH-L1 has been identified in familial Parkinson's disease." Then, in the results section, they talk about specific mutations. 

In the abstract, there's a mention of D30K UCH-L1, which lacks ubiquitin binding activity. The D30K is a mutation where the amino acid at position 30 is replaced by lysine. Then there's C90S, which is a substitution at position 90, serine instead of cysteine. 

In the introduction, they mention the I93M mutation in UCH-L1, which is associated with Parkinson's disease. This is a substitution at position 93, methionine instead of isoleucine. Also, the text says that Parkinson's disease-linked α-synuclein mutants reduce the secretion of endogenous UCH-L1. So, the α-synuclein mutants are mentioned, but the specific mutations in α-synuclein aren't detailed here. 

The user's task is to extract mutations from the text. The key points are:

1. UCH-L1 mutations:
   - D30K (ubiquitin binding activity loss)
   - C90S (hydrolase activity loss)
   - I93M (Parkinson's associated)
   - Also, the sequence from Leu-32 to Leu-39 being similar to the unconventional secretory signal, but that's more about the sequence than a mutation.

2. α-synuclein mutants are mentioned, but the specific mutations aren't described in the text. The text says "Parkinson's disease-linked α-synuclein mutants" but doesn't specify which ones. So for α-synuclein, the mutation details are not provided, so we should note that as N.D.

So, the extracted information would include the UCH-L1 mutations (D30K, C90S, I93M) and the α-synuclein mutants but without specific details. The answer should be structured in JSON as per the example given.
