Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants to extract mutation information from a medical text paragraph. The example given involves identifying gene names and specific mutations in their cDNA and protein forms.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully to spot any mutation-related terms. The context discusses PINK1 phosphorylating TRAP1 and includes various studies with methods and results sections. Terms like "mutations", "cDNAs", or specific variant notations (like c.248G>A) are what I'm looking for.

Going through each paragraph, I don't see any mentions of gene mutations. There's talk about protein interactions, phosphorylation sites, and experiments using siRNA, but no explicit mutation details. The references mostly focus on the effects of PINK1 and TRAP1 in cellular processes rather than genetic alterations.

Since there are no mutation terms or descriptions present, I'll need to return "N.D." for all fields except possibly the gene names if they're mentioned. In this case, though, even the gene names like PINK1 and TRAP1 aren't specified as having mutations. Therefore, the output should reflect that no mutation information is found.
