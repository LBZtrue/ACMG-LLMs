Alright, let me break down how I approached this query.

First, the user provided a detailed medical literature paragraph and asked for an extraction focused on mutations. My task was to identify if there's any mutation information and extract it accordingly.

I started by reading through the entire text carefully. The context is about protein structure and function, specifically discussing a mutation in the ADRB1 gene. I noticed mentions like "Arg30Thr substitution" which clearly indicates a mutation.

Next, I identified the specific parts related to mutations. The paragraph states that this substitution changes arginine (R) at position 30 to threonine (T). It also notes that this mutation occurs in the coding region of exon 2 and is associated with altered function.

I then mapped these details according to the required JSON format. For the gene, it's ADRB1. Under variants, I included the protein change from R to T at position 30, specifying both the reference (R) and alternative (T) amino acids. The description in the context was provided as "Arg30Thr substitution."

I made sure not to include any other information that wasn't directly related to mutations. Since there were no cDNA changes explicitly mentioned, I left those fields as "N.D.".

Finally, I structured all this information into a JSON format as specified, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {

                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "R",

            },
            "Description in input context": "Arg30Thr substitution"
        }
    ]
}
