Okay, so I need to figure out if the provided text contains any mutation information and then extract the relevant details. Let me start by carefully reading through the text.

Looking at the context section, it starts with a discussion about the gene LRRK2 (also known as PARK7), specifically mentioning that its mutations cause late-onset Parkinson's disease. It references multiple studies where different mutations in this gene have been identified in various populations.

The first paragraph mentions LRRK2 mutations and their association with families affected by autosomal dominant Parkinsonism. There's a specific mutation mentioned, I2020T, which is said to increase kinase activity and cause the disease. Another mutation, G2385R, is noted as an ancestral risk factor in Asian populations.

In paragraph 17, it discusses another mutation, G2385R, being associated with increased kinase activity leading to neuronal toxicity. Additionally, there's a mention of other mutations like K1096E and E2413V, though the specifics aren't detailed here.

The references section lists various studies, including ones that discuss LRRK2 mutations such as I2020T, G2385R, and others. Some studies look into how these mutations affect kinase activity and contribute to Parkinson's disease.

So, from this text, there are multiple mentions of specific mutations in the LRRK2 gene. Each mutation is associated with causing or increasing the risk of Parkinson's disease through increased kinase activity or structural changes in the protein.

I need to extract each mutation mentioned, noting their cDNA and protein changes if available. From the text, I can see that:

- The I2020T mutation is noted.
- The G2385R mutation is also mentioned.
- There's a mention of K1096E and E2413V mutations, but without specific cDNA or protein details.

I should structure the JSON to include each gene (which in this case is only LRRK2) and list all the variants found. For each variant, I'll note any available cDNA changes and protein changes. If specifics aren't provided, I'll mark them as N.D.
