Alright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They provided a detailed query about extracting mutation information from a medical literature paragraph. The example given involves looking for specific gene mutations and their details.

First, I need to understand the user's role as a professional data mining expert in medical literature. Their goal is to quickly identify if a text contains mutation info and extract relevant details. They emphasized accuracy and using "N.D." where information isn't present.

Looking at the example provided, they showed how to parse out gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, etc., and structure it into JSON. So my task would be to apply this same logic to the input text they're going to provide next.

In their example, the user's own response correctly identified the mutation details from the sample paragraph. Now, when I receive a new paragraph, I'll need to carefully read through it to spot any mentions of mutations, genes, or variations.

I should be on the lookout for terms like "c.XXXY", "p.XXtoY", gene names like TP53, BRCA1, etc., and any associated descriptions. If found, I'll extract the gene, cDNA changes (including position, ref/alt), protein changes similarly, and any additional context provided.

If there's no mutation info, I just return "N.D." for all fields except possibly indicating that no mutations were found.

I need to make sure my extraction is precise and adheres strictly to the JSON format specified. Missing any details or misinterpreting terms could lead to incorrect data mining results, which might affect downstream analyses.

Also, considering the user's constraints, I shouldn't infer beyond what's explicitly stated in the text. If a mutation's effect isn't described, I'll leave that part as "N.D." unless it's mentioned.

Overall, my approach is methodical: read carefully, identify relevant terms, extract accurately, and structure the information as required.
