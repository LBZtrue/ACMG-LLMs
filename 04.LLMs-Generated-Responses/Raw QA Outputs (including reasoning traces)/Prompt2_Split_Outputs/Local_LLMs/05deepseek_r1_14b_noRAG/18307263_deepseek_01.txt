Alright, so I've been given this medical literature paragraph to analyze and extract mutation information. Let me start by carefully reading through it to understand the content.

The first part mentions that mutations in PINK1 were found, specifically two heterozygous rare variants. The gene involved is PINK1. It also notes that these are associated with hereditary early-onset Parkinson's disease but don't cause dominant or recessive effects. That suggests these are variants rather than pathogenic mutations.

Looking further down, it describes the variants: c.1366C>T and c.3809T>C (p.Asp25Gly). These are the specific cDNA changes, with their positions in the transcript. The protein changes result in amino acid substitutions at position 25 from Asp to Gly.

The article references studies that found these mutations occur in sporadic cases and families with Parkinson's disease, but they don't lead to a dominant or recessive pattern. This is important because it clarifies the type of effect each variant has.

I need to extract gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and their descriptions from the paragraph. The paragraph also mentions that these variants are rare and heterozygous, which adds context about their occurrence.

I should structure this information into a JSON format as specified, making sure to include all relevant details and mark any missing information with "N.D.". Since all required fields are present, I won't need many N.D. entries here.
