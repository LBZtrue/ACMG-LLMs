Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from this medical literature paragraph. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The first part mentions that mutations were found in PINK1. Specifically, there's a c.692A>G (p.E231G) mutation and another at position 1573, which is G>A leading to p.D525N. These seem to be specific genetic variants causing changes in the protein.

Looking further down, I see more details like "c.1015G>A (p.A339T)" and "c.1325T>C (p.I442T)". Each of these has a corresponding cDNA change and the resulting amino acid substitution. There's also mention of how some mutations cause late-onset PD or affect response to levodopa.

I should extract each mutation, noting the gene as PINK1 since all changes are within this gene. For each variant, I'll need the transcript (if available), reference allele, alternate allele, position in DNA and protein, and a brief description from the context.
