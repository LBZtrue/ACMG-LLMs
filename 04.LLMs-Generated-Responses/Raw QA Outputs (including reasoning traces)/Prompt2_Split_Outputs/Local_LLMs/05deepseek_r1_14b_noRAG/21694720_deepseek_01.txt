Alright, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. Let's start by reading through each paragraph carefully.

First, I'll scan for any terms related to mutations, such as "mutations," "mutant," "c.XXXXY" or "p.XXXY" notations, or mentions of genetic changes. Each paragraph is pretty dense with scientific terms, so I need to be thorough.

Looking at the first paragraph, it talks about a restriction-free cloning method. Nothing about mutations there. The next paragraphs mention various studies on parkin and PINK1, but they discuss things like gene expression, protein interactions, and cellular functions, not specific mutations.

Continuing through the literature, I see terms like "expanded polyglutamine proteins" in one paragraph, which refers to a type of mutation causing protein elongation. However, this is more about the effect of mutations rather than specifying particular genetic changes. Another paragraph mentions "autoregulation of Parkin activity," but again, no specific mutations are detailed.

As I go further into the references, some paragraphs discuss studies where mutations in genes like PARK2 and PINK1 cause hereditary Parkinson’s disease. For example, Valente et al. (2004) identified mutations in PINK1 causing early-onset PD. This is relevant because it directly mentions a gene with specific mutations linked to the disease.

Another study by Veriah et al. (2010) found somatic mutations in PARK2 across various cancers, which again ties into mutation information. These are key points since they provide specific instances of genetic changes causing medical conditions.

However, most of the other paragraphs don't specify particular mutations but discuss the function or regulation of parkin and PINK1 proteins. For example, discussions about Parkin's role in ubiquitination or mitochondrial autophagy don’t involve mutation details.

So, to summarize, only a few paragraphs directly reference mutations. Specifically, Valente et al. (2004) identified mutations in the PINK1 gene causing hereditary early-onset Parkinson’s disease, and Veriah et al. (2010) reported somatic PARK2 mutations in cancers. 

I'll extract these instances, noting the gene names and the context of their mutations without specific cDNA or protein changes since those details aren't provided.
