Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph and present it in a specific JSON format. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the input text provided. Looking at the example given, the output requires details like Gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. If any of these aren't present, they should be marked as "N.D.".

In the context provided, the paragraphs mention various mutations: A104T, E163K, M26I, A104V, M26L, and E163K/R145E. These are likely protein-level changes since they follow a format like "A104T", where the letter denotes an amino acid change and the number is the position.

However, looking deeper, I don't see any cDNA or transcript information mentioned in the text. The focus seems to be on structural consequences of these mutations rather than the DNA level changes. Without specific details on how each mutation affects the cDNA (like codon changes), I can only note that this information is not provided.

The "Description in input context" for each mutation would then refer to how these changes are described in the literature, such as structural effects or functional implications. Since the text discusses things like dual conformations and anisotropy, those should be included in the description.

Putting it all together, I'll list each mutation with their respective positions but mark cDNA changes as "N.D." since they're not provided.
