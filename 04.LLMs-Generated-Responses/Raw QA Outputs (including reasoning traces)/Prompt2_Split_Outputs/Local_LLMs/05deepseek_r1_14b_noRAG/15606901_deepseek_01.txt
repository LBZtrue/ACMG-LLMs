Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is a professional medical literature data mining expert looking to extract mutation information from the provided text. First, I'll read through each paragraph carefully to identify any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the first paragraph, there's no mention of specific gene mutations or variations. It talks about protein localization and proteasome interaction but doesn't specify mutations. So, I note that no mutation info is present here.

Moving on to the second paragraph, again, it discusses Parkin's role in ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and its effect on neurons without mentioning any genetic changes. No mutation details are found here either.

The third paragraph introduces a study where a new mutation (R42P) in the parkin gene is associated with parkinsonism. This is relevant as it clearly describes a specific mutation: R42P, located in the ubiquitin-like domain of Parkin. I'll extract this information noting the gene name and the mutation details.

The fourth paragraph doesn't discuss mutations but focuses on protein interactions with proteasome subunits. So, no mutation info here.

Continuing through the rest of the paragraphs, most focus on protein function, localization, or interaction studies without mentioning specific genetic mutations. The only exception is the already noted R42P mutation in one of the earlier paragraphs.

Finally, after reviewing all sections, it's clear that only the R42P mutation in the parkin gene is mentioned. I'll structure this information into a JSON format as per the user's instructions, ensuring accurate extraction and filling in N.D. where details aren't provided beyond what's stated.
