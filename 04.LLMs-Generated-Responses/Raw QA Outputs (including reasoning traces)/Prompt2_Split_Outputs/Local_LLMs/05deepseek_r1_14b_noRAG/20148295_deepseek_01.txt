Okay, so I've got this query where the user is acting as a professional medical literature data mining expert. Their goal is to extract mutation-related information from paragraphs of medical text. The user provided an example and some specific instructions on how to format the output.

First, I need to carefully read each paragraph to spot any mutation terms. They're looking for gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. If there's nothing about mutations, I should just return "N.D." for all fields.

Looking at the first paragraph, I see mentions of α-synuclein mutations like E46K and A53T. These are known PD-related mutations. So, for each mutation found, I need to extract details. For example, E46K is listed as a mutation causing both PD and Lewy body dementia.

In the second paragraph, there's another mutation, A53T. It mentions it causes early-onset PD but doesn't specify exact changes in cDNA or protein beyond the position (A53T implies an alanine to threonine change at position 53). So I'll note that.

The third paragraph discusses a truncation mutation (E46K again) leading to selective nigral dopamine neuron loss. Since it's a truncation, I can infer a frameshift or premature stop codon, but without exact cDNA details, I'll just state the effect.

Putting this together, I need to create a JSON structure with each gene and their variants, including any available cDNA and protein changes. For missing details, "N.D." is used.

I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted, using arrays for multiple variants under each gene. Each variant object includes transcript, ref, alt, position for cDNA, and similar for protein if available.

Finally, I'll compile all this information into a structured response that meets the user's requirements.
