Okay, I need to determine whether the provided text contains mutation information and extract relevant details if it does. The user has given a list of references with various study details but no specific mention of mutations or genetic changes.

First, I'll review each paragraph for terms like "mutation," "cDNA change," "protein change," or any notation indicating a genetic alteration. Terms such as "DJ-1-ASK1 interaction" relate to protein interactions, not mutations. Other terms like "oxidizable residues" refer to chemical modifications, which aren't the same as mutations.

I'll go through each entry:

1. **Reference 1**: Talks about DJ-1 and ASK1 interaction; no mention of mutation.
2. **Reference 2**: Discusses the role of proteins but doesn't specify any genetic changes.
3. **Reference 3**: Focuses on the interaction between proteins without indicating mutations.
4. ... (Continuing this process for each reference)... All entries seem to describe studies on protein interactions, enzyme activity, or signaling pathways without introducing specific mutations.

Since none of the references mention mutations, variants, or genetic alterations, there's no mutation information to extract. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, I should return "N.D." for all fields related to mutation details.
