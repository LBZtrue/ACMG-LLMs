Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given text. Let's start by reading through the provided paragraph carefully.

The first part mentions a study on E46K mutation in α-synuclein. That immediately flags as a mutation point. So, E46K refers to a change at position 46 in the protein where glutamic acid (E) is replaced with lysine (K). 

I need to identify if there are any gene names here. The term "α-synuclein" is the gene involved. It's also known by other names, but I think SNCA is a common alias. 

Looking for cDNA changes: The text mentions E46K, which is at position 46. However, it doesn't specify the exact nucleotide change in the DNA or cDNA. So, I'll note that as "N.D." since it's not provided.

For protein changes, E46K clearly indicates a substitution from glutamic acid to lysine at amino acid 46. There are no other variants mentioned in this paragraph, so only one entry is needed under variants.

The context describes how this mutation increases amyloid fibril formation and causes α-synuclein to misfold and aggregate, leading to neurotoxic effects. This is important for the description as it explains the effect of the mutation.

I should structure all this information into JSON format as specified. Make sure each part is correctly labeled and any missing info is marked with "N.D.".

```json

    "Gene": "SNCA (α-synuclein)",
    "variants": [

            },

            },
            "Description in input context": "The E46K mutation in α-synuclein increases amyloid fibril formation and causes misfolding and aggregation of the protein, leading to neurotoxic effects."
        }
    ]
}
