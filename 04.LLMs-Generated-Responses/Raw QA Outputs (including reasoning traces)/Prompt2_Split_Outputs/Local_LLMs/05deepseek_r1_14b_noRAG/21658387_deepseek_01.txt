Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read through the context provided, which lists several references with abstracts or study details. Each entry has a list of authors and some abbreviations like "WT" for wild-type, "I2020T", etc., followed by a description in parentheses.

Looking at each reference:

1. **Reference 35**: It mentions mutant LRRK2 causing neuronal toxicity but doesn't specify the exact mutation details beyond being a mutant.
2. **Reference 36**: Talks about interactions between parkin and mutant LRRK2, again without specifying the mutation specifics.
3. **References 37-40** (seems like more study entries) don't have detailed mutation info; they mention effects but not the specific mutations.

I'm noticing that many references refer to "mutant LRRK2" but don't provide the exact cDNA or protein changes, just that it's a mutant form. For instance, some might say things like "the I2020T mutant" which refers to a known mutation (c.I2020T), leading to p.M679T in the protein.

However, in the given context, most of these references don't explicitly state the exact mutation details beyond being mutants. So, without specific cDNA or protein changes mentioned, I can only note that mutations are involved but not extract detailed information.

Therefore, the conclusion is that while the literature discusses mutant LRRK2, it doesn't provide the specific cDNA or protein change details in the given context.
