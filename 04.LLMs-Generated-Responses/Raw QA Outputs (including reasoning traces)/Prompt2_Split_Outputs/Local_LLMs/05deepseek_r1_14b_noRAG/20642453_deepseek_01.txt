Alright, I need to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking me to act as a professional medical literature data mining expert. Their goal is to extract mutation-related information from paragraphs of medical literature. They provided an example and specific output format in JSON.

First, I'll review the input text they provided. It's a research article about LRRK2 interacting with 14-3-3 proteins and how certain mutations affect this interaction. The abstract mentions that multiple PD-associated LRRK2 mutants were analyzed for kinase activity, phosphorylation status, and binding to 14-3-3 proteins.

I need to check if there are any specific mutations described in the text. Scanning through, I see references to "Ser910" and "Ser935" phosphorylation sites. The supplementary online data includes a table (Table S1) that lists 41 PD-associated LRRK2 mutations with details on kinase activity, phosphorylation, and binding.

The user's example shows extracting gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. However, the provided text doesn't specify exact nucleotide or amino acid changes for each mutation. It mainly discusses effects like increased kinase activity or reduced binding without detailed mutation specifics.

So, I'll structure the JSON to reflect what's available. The gene is LRRK2. Since specific mutations aren't detailed in the main text but are listed in Table S1, which isn't fully provided here, I'll note that for each mutant, there are effects on kinase activity and binding without exact variant info.

Therefore, my output will indicate LRRK2 as the gene and describe the general effects of the mutations without specific cDNA or protein changes. For missing details like transcript, ref, alt, etc., I'll use "N.D." to signify that information isn't provided in the input text.
