Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user has provided a set of paragraphs from medical literature and wants me to determine if any contain information about mutations. If they do, I need to extract specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions. If not, I should return "N.D." for the missing parts.

First, I'll go through each paragraph one by one to check for mutation-related terms or descriptions. Mutation information often includes words like "mutation," "variant," "c.XXXX," which refers to cDNA changes, or "p.XXX" indicating protein changes. Sometimes, it might mention specific amino acid alterations or gene names.

Looking at the first paragraph (Paragraph 1), I don't see any mentions of mutations. It talks about the context of the study and references other studies, but nothing about genetic changes. So, I'll note that as "N.D." for all fields.

Moving to Paragraph 2, it discusses the ubiquitin-like domain of Parkin. The term "mutations" isn't explicitly mentioned here either. They're focusing on structural aspects rather than genetic alterations. Again, no mutation info is present.

Paragraph 3 references a study where mutations in PINK1 are described. Here, I can extract that the gene is PINK1 and there's an associated mutation, though specific cDNA or protein changes aren't detailed in this paragraph. So, I'll capture the gene and note that descriptions are "N.D."

In Paragraph 4, they refer to another study where mutations in Parkin are found. Again, no specifics on cDNA or protein changes, so I'll extract the gene name and mark other fields as "N.D."

Paragraphs 5 through 48 continue without mentioning any specific mutations. They discuss experiments, structures, interactions, but not genetic mutations. Therefore, all these paragraphs will result in "N.D." for mutation-related information.

After reviewing all paragraphs, only Paragraphs 3 and 4 mention mutations, specifically regarding the PINK1 and Parkin genes respectively, without detailed cDNA or protein changes.
