Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraphs. The user is a professional looking for mutations, and they want specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

First, I'll go through each paragraph one by one. I remember that mutations are often mentioned with terms like "mutations," "mutated," or specific notations like c. (coding) followed by numbers and letters, and p. for protein changes.

Looking at the first paragraph about Petit et al., 2005: It mentions wild-type PINK1 prevents apoptosis but this effect is lost in mutations causing Parkinson's. So, there are mutations in PINK1 linked to PD. But I don't see specific cDNA or protein changes here; it just says mutations.

Next, the Silvestri et al., 2005 paragraph talks about mitochondrial import issues and enzymatic activity of PINK1 mutants. It refers to "mutants associated to recessive parkinsonism." Again, mentions mutants but no specifics on where or what the mutations are.

Then there's a study by Sherer et al., 2002: They mention an in vitro model linking mitochondrial impairment to alpha-synuclein metabolism and oxidative damage. No mutation info here; it's more about mechanisms.

The Zimprich et al., 2004 paragraph discusses LRRK2 mutations causing autosomal-dominant Parkinsonism with varied pathology. It says "mutations in LRRK2," but doesn't provide specific cDNA or protein changes.

Lastly, the Valente et al., 2004a paper talks about PINK1 mutations causing hereditary early-onset PD. Again, mentions mutations without specifics.

So, across all these paragraphs, there are mentions of genes (PINK1, LRRK2) and that they have mutations linked to Parkinson's, but no detailed cDNA or protein changes provided. Each paragraph just states the presence of mutations related to specific genes in the context of the disease.

Therefore, for each relevant paragraph, I'll note the gene involved and indicate that there are mutations without providing specific details since they aren't present in the text.
