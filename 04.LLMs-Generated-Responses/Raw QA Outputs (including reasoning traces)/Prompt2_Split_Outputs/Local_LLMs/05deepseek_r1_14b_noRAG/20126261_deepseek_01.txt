Okay, I need to determine whether the provided medical literature paragraph contains any mutation-related information and extract the relevant details. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll read the entire paragraph thoroughly. It discusses PINK1 accumulation promoting Parkin recruitment in the context of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. The paragraph references various studies and experiments, including knockout models and interactions between proteins like HtrA2 and PARL. It also mentions mutations such as G58R in the SNCA gene.

I'm looking for any mention of specific mutations, their locations (cDNA or protein), and their descriptions. Scanning through each sentence:

- In paragraph 49: "A disease state mutation unfolds the parkin ubiquitin-like domain." This indicates a mutation in the parkin gene, but doesn't provide specifics like cDNA changes or protein alterations.

- Paragraph 50: Discusses various mutations in the parkin gene responsible for Parkinson's. Again, mentions mutations exist but lacks detailed information on specific variants.

- Paragraph 51: Talks about PINK1-associated mutations causing neuronal vulnerability to calcium-induced cell death but doesn't specify mutation details.

- Paragraph 54 and 55: Refer to Atg32 and mitophagy mechanisms without mentioning mutations.

- Paragraphs 60, 61, and others seem to focus on experimental methods or functional studies rather than specific genetic mutations.

Looking through the examples provided earlier, I see that in Example 1, the mutation was explicitly stated with cDNA and protein changes. In the current text, while there's discussion about mutations (e.g., parkin gene mutations), no specific cDNA or protein-level details are given. The mention of G58R is a clue but it's part of another study referenced.

Therefore, the information in the provided paragraph doesn't contain explicit mutation data such as cDNA changes or specific protein alterations beyond mentioning that mutations exist. So, I should return "N.D." for those fields since they aren't detailed here.

The provided medical literature paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific mutations with corresponding cDNA or protein changes. It discusses the presence of mutations in general terms but lacks detailed information on their specifics.
