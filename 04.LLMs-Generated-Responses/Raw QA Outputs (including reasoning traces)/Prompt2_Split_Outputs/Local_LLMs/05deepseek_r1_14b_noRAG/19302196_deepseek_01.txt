Alright, so I'm faced with extracting mutation information from a complex paragraph of medical literature. First, I'll carefully read through the text to identify any mentions of mutations or genetic changes related to Parkinson's disease and LRRK2.

Looking at the provided context, I notice several references to LRRK2 mutations, such as G2019S, I2786T, and M1834I. These are common pathogenic variants linked to Parkinson’s disease. My goal is to extract each mutation's details accurately.

For each mutation mentioned, I need to capture the gene name (which is LRRK2 in all cases), the specific cDNA changes (like G2019S indicating a glycine to serine substitution at position 2019), and any relevant protein changes. If there are no mutations discussed, I should return "N.D." for all fields.

I'll systematically go through each paragraph, noting down each mutation's specifics. For example, the G2019S mutation is described as causing increased kinase activity leading to neuronal toxicity. Similarly, other mutations like M1834I are associated with altered functions or enhanced enzymatic activities.

Once I've identified all relevant mutations and their details, I'll structure this information into a JSON format, ensuring each variant's cDNA and protein changes are accurately represented. If any mutation lacks specific details in the text, I'll mark those fields as "N.D." to maintain completeness.
