Alright, so I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to act as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. The task is to extract mutation information from a given text. Let's break down what they need.

First, the user provided an example response in JSON format. That gives me a clear idea of how they expect the output. They want gene names, cDNA and protein changes, and descriptions if available. If something isn't mentioned, I should use "N.D.".

I'll start by reading through each paragraph carefully. Since mutations can be described in various ways, I need to look for terms like "mutations", "c.XXXX", or "p.YY" which denote amino acid changes. Also, gene names are often capitalized and followed by specific identifiers.

Looking at the provided context, I see several mentions of alpha-synuclein mutations. For instance, "E46K" is a known mutation linked to Parkinson's. Similarly, "c.235delC (p.R79C)" and others like "A53T", "A30P", and "H50Q" are listed in the paragraphs. These seem important as they directly relate to mutations.

I'll extract each gene mentioned, which in this case is consistently alpha-synuclein across all paragraphs. For each mutation, I need to parse the cDNA and protein changes accurately. However, some entries don't specify the exact position or type of change beyond the variant name, so I'll mark those as "N.D." where details are missing.

I also notice that some mutations have more detailed descriptions, like their effect on pathogenesis, while others are just listed without additional context. Including these descriptions adds value to the extracted information.

Finally, I'll structure all this data into a JSON format, ensuring each mutation is correctly categorized under its gene and includes all relevant details or placeholders where necessary.
