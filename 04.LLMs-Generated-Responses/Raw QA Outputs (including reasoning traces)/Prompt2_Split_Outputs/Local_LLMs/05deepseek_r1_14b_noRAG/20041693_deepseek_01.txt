Alright, so I need to figure out if the given paragraphs from medical literature contain any mutation information and then extract that info properly. Let me go through each paragraph one by one.

Starting with paragraph 1: It's talking about pubs context but nothing about mutations. So, no relevant data here. 

Paragraph 2 refers to a study by Georgieva et al. (2008) where they use spin labeling and MD simulations. They're studying R-synuclein's structure when bound to membranes. No mention of any mutations here either.

Looking at paragraph 3: Bortolus et al. (2008) also did a study using site-directed spin labeling and MD simulations. Again, it's about the structure of R-synuclein in micelles, no mutations involved.

Paragraph 4 is from Eliezer et al. (2001). They discuss conformational properties of free and lipid-associated R-synuclein. Still nothing on mutations.

Moving to paragraph 5: The study by Rivers et al. (2008) compares the aggregation behavior of R- and β-synuclein, but no specific mutation details are provided.

Paragraph 6 talks about a region in NAC responsible for aggregation. This is related to Alzheimer's but doesn't mention mutations.

Paragraph 7: Giasson et al. (2001) found that a hydrophobic stretch of 12 amino acids in R-synuclein is essential for filament assembly. Still no mutations here; it's about the structure and its importance.

Finally, paragraph 8: Vilar et al. (2008) determined the fold of R-synuclein fibrils using techniques like NMR and X-ray crystallography. No mutation info here either.

After reviewing all paragraphs, none of them mention any specific mutations or genetic changes related to R-synuclein or other genes in the context studied. Therefore, there's no mutation information to extract.
