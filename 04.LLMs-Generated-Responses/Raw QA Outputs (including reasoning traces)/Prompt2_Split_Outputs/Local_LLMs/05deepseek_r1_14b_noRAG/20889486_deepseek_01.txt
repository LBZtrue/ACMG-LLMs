Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. First, I'll read through each paragraph carefully.

Starting with Paragraph 1, it talks about PINK1-dependent recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria. There's a mention of mutations in DJ-1 and their effects on E3 ligase activity, but no specific cDNA or protein changes are given. So, I won't extract mutation data here; it's more about the functional aspect.

Moving to Paragraph 2, this one discusses the role of Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 in forming a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Again, no specific mutations are mentioned; it's about their interaction and function.

Paragraph 3 is about oxidative stress affecting parkin and other E3 ligases. The context here is about how oxidative stress impacts these proteins, not any specific mutations.

In Paragraph 4, the focus shifts to bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice with a truncated mutant Parkin. This indicates that there's a mutation—specifically a truncation—but no details like cDNA changes or protein positions are provided. So, I'll note that a Parkin truncation exists but without specifics.

Paragraphs 5 and 6 talk about the effects of proteasome depletion in mouse models. These sections don't mention any mutations; they're discussing the consequences of proteasome dysfunction.

Paragraphs 7 through 10 delve into various studies involving rhodopsin processing, IFT complexes, and their implications without mentioning mutations. Similarly, Paragraph 11 discusses photoreceptor IFT complexes with chaperones but again no mutations are specified.

After reviewing all the paragraphs, only Paragraph 4 mentions a mutation context, specifically a truncated mutant Parkin. However, there's no detailed information about cDNA or protein changes provided in that paragraph.
