Alright, I'm looking at the user's query where they want to extract mutation information from a medical literature paragraph. The user provided an example and specified that if there's no mutation info, return "N.D.".

First, I'll start by reading through the provided text carefully. It seems to be a letter to J Med Genet discussing the coexistence of mutations in mitochondrial DNA and PINK1. 

I notice terms like "mutations", "ND6 gene", and specific mentions of cDNA changes such as m.4390A>G. The text also refers to point mutations affecting complex I subunits, which are part of the mitochondrial genome.

I need to identify the genes involved. From the context, the ND6 gene is a key player here, and it's located in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). 

Looking for cDNA changes, I see m.4390A>G as an example. This indicates a transition from adenine to guanine at position 4390 in the mitochondrial genome.

For protein changes, the text mentions that this mutation results in the amino acid alteration p.Ser11Arg. So, serine is replaced by arginine at position 11 of the ND6 subunit.

Additionally, there's mention of other point mutations affecting complex I subunits, but no specific details on their exact cDNA or protein changes are provided beyond this example.

The context explains that these mutations can lead to structural and functional defects in complex I. Also, patients with PINK1 mutations may have impaired responses to mitochondrial stress, which worsens dopaminergic neuron degeneration.

Putting it all together, the extracted JSON should include the gene (ND6), the specific cDNA change mentioned, the protein change, and a brief description of how these mutations impact complex I and patient outcomes.
