Okay, I need to determine if the provided text contains any mutation-related information and extract it accordingly. Let me go through each paragraph one by one.

Starting with paragraph 1: It talks about PINK1 mutants in Drosophila being complemented by parkin. No specific mutation terms like cDNA changes or protein alterations are mentioned here.

Paragraph 2 mentions Leigh-like syndrome but doesn't specify any mutations, just that the complex I is affected.

Moving to paragraph 3: This one discusses a nonsense mutation in NDUFS4 leading to Leigh-like syndrome. So here, the gene is NDUFS4, and there's a specific mutation described as a nonsense mutation causing the disorder.

Paragraph 4 doesn't mention mutations but talks about phosphorylation in mitochondria.

Continuing through paragraphs 5-10: These discuss various studies on PINK1 and parkin, mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasome issues, and other related topics. None of these directly describe specific mutations beyond what was noted in paragraph 3.

So, from the entire text, the only mutation information is found in paragraph 3 regarding NDUFS4 with a nonsense mutation leading to Leigh-like syndrome.
