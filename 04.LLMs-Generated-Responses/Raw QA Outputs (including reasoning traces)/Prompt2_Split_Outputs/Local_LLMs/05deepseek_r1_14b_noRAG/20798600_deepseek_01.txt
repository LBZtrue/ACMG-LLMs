Okay, I'm looking at this question where the user wants to extract mutation information from a medical literature paragraph. They provided an example of how they want the output formatted in JSON, so I need to make sure my answer follows that structure.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. The text discusses experiments involving mutations in the PINK1 gene. Specifically, it mentions creating mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and testing their effects on mitochondrial function.

I notice terms like "mutations" and "site-directed mutagenesis," which are strong indicators of mutation information. So, there's definitely mutation data here.

Next, I need to extract the relevant details. The context doesn't specify the exact cDNA or protein changes caused by these mutations. It just mentions that various amino acids were mutated without providing specifics like position numbers or nucleotide changes.

Given this, I'll structure my JSON response accordingly. Since the specific mutation details aren't provided in the text, those fields will be marked as "N.D." to indicate that information isn't available.

I should ensure that the output is accurate and only includes what's present. The user emphasized extracting only directly related mutation info, so I won't make assumptions about the mutations beyond what's stated.

So, my final JSON will include the gene name as PINK1 and note that no specific cDNA or protein changes are mentioned in the context.
