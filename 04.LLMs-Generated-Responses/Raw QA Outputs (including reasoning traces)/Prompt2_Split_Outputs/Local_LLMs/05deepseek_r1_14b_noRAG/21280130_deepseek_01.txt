Okay, so I need to determine whether the provided paragraph contains any mutation-related information and then extract specific details if it does. Let's start by carefully reading through each of the 53 references listed.

I'll go through each reference one by one to see if any mention mutations. Mutations typically involve changes in DNA sequences (like point mutations, insertions, deletions) which can lead to changes in proteins.

Looking at Reference 1: It's about the core structure of alpha-synuclein fibrils. No mention of mutations here.

Reference 2: Talks about the role of a hydrophobic stretch in alpha-synuclein for filament assembly. Again, no mutations discussed.

Reference 3: Refers to pre-fibrillar variants with impaired beta-structure increasing neurotoxicity. Still no mutation info.

Reference 4: Discusses alpha-synucleinopathy models and human neuropathology but doesn't mention specific mutations.

References continue in this vein. Most are discussing the structure, aggregation, or effects of alpha-synuclein, often comparing wild-type (wt) and mutant forms. For example, Reference 9 talks about A30P and E46K mutants. Here's where I see mutations: "A30P" and "E46K". These are specific point mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene.

So for each of these references that mention a mutation like A30P or E46K, I need to extract the gene (which is alpha-synuclein), the cDNA change, protein change, and any description provided.

I'll check through all 53 references again quickly. Only Reference 9 mentions mutations explicitly as part of their study on mutant variants.
