Alright, let's tackle this query. The user is a professional medical literature data mining expert who needs to extract mutation information from paragraphs of medical literature. They provided an example and want the response in JSON format.

First, I'll read through the context given carefully. It's about Parkin mutations promoting aggregation. I notice terms like "mutations," "parkin gene," and specific references to studies on E2-dependent ubiquitin-protein ligase activity.

I need to identify if there are any specific mutation details. Looking at each paragraph, I spot mentions of "Parkin mutations" in the introduction but no specific cDNA or protein changes. In the results section, they talk about two types of Parkin mutants: one with a C-terminal truncation and another with an E2-binding site mutation. However, without exact positions or nucleotide changes, these are more conceptual.

In the references, there's a study by Shimura et al. (2001) where parkin ubiquitinates alpha-synuclein, but again, no specific mutations are detailed in that context either.

Since there's no explicit cDNA or protein change mentioned in the provided text, I'll have to supplement with "N.D." for those fields. The gene is clearly Parkin, so that can be included. The description notes that mutations lead to aggregation and loss of E3 ligase activity.

I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring all fields are present but marked as N.D. where information isn't provided.
