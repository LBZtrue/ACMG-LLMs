Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. Let's start by reading through the text carefully.

The first part talks about a study involving the p53 promoter and parkin mutations in familial Parkinson’s disease (AR-JP). It mentions that certain mutations in parkin are associated with an increase in p53 expression. The specific mutations listed are C418R, C441R, K161N, and R256C.

Next, the paragraph provides details on where these mutations occur: C418R is at codon 418, C441R at 441, K161N at 161 (amino acid change from lysine to asparagine), and R256C at 256. These are all missense mutations.

Then, the text discusses experiments in SH-SY5Y cells showing that these mutant parkin constructs fail to repress p53 promoter activity, indicating a loss of function. It also mentions human brain samples where the same mutations lead to higher p53 expression.

So, from this paragraph, I can extract the following mutation information:

- **Gene**: Parkin ( PARK7 gene)
- **Mutations**:
  - C418R: A codon change at position 418 leading to arginine substitution.
  - C441R: Codon change at 441, resulting in arginine.
  - K161N: Lysine to asparagine at position 161.
  - R256C: Arginine to cysteine at position 256.

Each of these mutations is a missense mutation affecting specific amino acids in the parkin protein. The context explains that these mutations impair the ability of parkin to repress p53 expression, leading to increased p53 activity and potentially contributing to Parkinson’s disease.
