Okay, I need to extract mutation information from the given medical literature text. Let me carefully read through the paragraph to identify any mentions of mutations.

I see that there are several references to mutations in the context of Parkinson's disease. Specifically, mutations like Ala30Pro (A30P), E46K, and others are discussed. These are known mutations associated with alpha-synuclein gene.

First, I'll look for gene names. The gene mentioned is clearly alpha-synuclein. Next, I need to identify the specific variants or mutations described.

Looking at each mutation:

1. A30P: This refers to an alanine to proline substitution at position 30.
2. E46K: Glutamic acid to lysine substitution at position 46.

I should structure this information into a JSON format, listing each variant with their respective cDNA and protein changes. However, since the text doesn't provide specific transcript information or exact positions beyond the amino acid level, I'll mark those as "N.D." for not determined.

So, in summary, the gene is alpha-synuclein, and there are two variants: A30P and E46K. Each has their respective protein changes but no cDNA details provided.
