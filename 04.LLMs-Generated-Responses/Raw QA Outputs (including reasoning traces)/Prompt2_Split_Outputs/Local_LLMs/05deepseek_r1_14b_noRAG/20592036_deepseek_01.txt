Alright, I'm looking at the user's query where they need to extract mutation information from a given text. The text provided is a list of references with study details but doesn't mention any mutations.

First, I'll read through each paragraph carefully. Each entry seems to be a citation without discussing genetic changes or mutations. Terms like "cDNA," "protein change," or specific mutation notations are absent.

I notice that the studies focus on topics like helix interconversion of α-synuclein and various biochemical processes but don't introduce any mutations. There's no mention of gene names with associated cDNA or protein changes.

Since there's no mutation information, according to the user's instructions, I should return "N.D." for all fields. This means supplementing each missing piece of data with "N.D." as specified.

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "N.D."
        }
    ]
}
