Alright, I'm going to tackle this query step by step. The user is a professional looking to extract mutation information from medical literature, so accuracy and precision are crucial. First, I'll read through the provided text carefully.

Looking at the context, it's an abstract discussing DJ-1 mutations related to Parkinson's disease. Scanning for mutation-related terms, I spot "L166P mutant DJ-1," which immediately catches my attention as a known mutation in this field. 

Next, I need to extract specific details: gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and any descriptions. The gene is clearly DJ-1. For the variants, the text mentions that the L166P mutant causes instability and forms higher-order complexes. However, it doesn't provide specific cDNA or protein position details beyond the amino acid change from Leu to Pro at position 166.

I'll structure this information into a JSON format as per the user's instructions. Since detailed cDNA changes aren't mentioned, I'll mark those as "N.D." (not determined). The protein change is specified, so that will be included with 'L' changing to 'P' at position 166.

Finally, ensuring all constraints are met, I make sure the JSON accurately reflects the extracted data and supplements missing information appropriately. This approach should fulfill the user's requirements effectively.
