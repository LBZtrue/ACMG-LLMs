Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. The user provided a detailed example and some specific instructions on what to look for. Let me start by reading through the paragraph carefully.

Looking at Figure 8 in the context, it mentions that mutations in DJ-1 can cause Parkinson's disease. Specifically, it talks about two mutations: one at position 149 and another at position 166. These mutations affect DJ-1's cleavage by caspase-6 and its stability.

I should identify the gene first, which is clearly DJ-1 here. Next, I need to extract each mutation's details. The paragraph doesn't provide the specific cDNA changes, so those will be marked as N.D. Similarly, there's no mention of protein-level changes beyond their positions (149 and 166). The descriptions in context are about preventing cleavage or destabilizing the protein.

I'll structure this into a JSON format with each mutation listed under "variants." Each variant should have its position and description as per the input. I'll make sure to include that the mutations are point mutations since that's inferred from the context, even if not explicitly stated.

Double-checking for any other mutation details or terms but I don't see more information in this paragraph. So I think this is all the data I can extract.

            "Description in input context": "Mutation at position 166 destabilizes DJ-1 and renders the protein prone to rapid degradation"
        }
    ]
}
