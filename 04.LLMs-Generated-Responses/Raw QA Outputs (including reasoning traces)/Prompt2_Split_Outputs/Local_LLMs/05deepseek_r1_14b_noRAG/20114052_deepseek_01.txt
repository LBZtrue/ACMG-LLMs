Alright, let me go through the thought process of how I arrived at the answer for this query.

First, I need to understand the user's request. They want me to act as a professional medical literature data mining expert. My role is to extract mutation-related information from a given text paragraph. The output should be in JSON format, specifying gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions of the mutations found.

Looking at the provided context, I see several references to mutations or genetic alterations. The first relevant paragraph mentions "Plasma membrane ion permeability induced by mutant α-synuclein contributes to the degeneration of neural cells." This indicates a mutation in α-synuclein but doesn't specify the exact type or location.

Next, another paragraph states: "The role of glycosphingolipid metabolism in the developing brain." While this discusses gene function, it doesn't mention mutations.

Then, I encounter two paragraphs about ganglioside GM3. The first one says that GM3 is involved in neuronal cell death, but not in mutation context. The second paragraph describes a study where a homozygous loss-of-function mutation of GM3 synthase causes infantile-onset epilepsy. Here, "GM3 synthase" refers to the enzyme responsible for synthesizing ganglioside GM3, and the mutation is a loss-of-function type.

I also note that there are no specific cDNA or protein change details provided in these paragraphs. They only mention that a mutation exists without giving specifics like positions or amino acid changes.

So, from this analysis, I identified two mentions related to mutations: one about mutant α-synuclein and another about GM3 synthase. However, only the GM3 synthase mutation provides enough detail for extraction, as it specifies the gene affected and the type of mutation (loss-of-function). The α-synuclein mention lacks specific details.

Therefore, I extract the relevant information from the GM3 synthase paragraph, noting that the gene is involved in a loss-of-function mutation. Since there's no cDNA or protein change specified, those fields are marked as "N.D.".
