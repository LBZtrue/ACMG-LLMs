Alright, so I need to help the user extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. The user is acting as a professional data mining expert and needs precise extraction of gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and their descriptions.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. It's an academic paper discussing mutations in the LRRK2 gene related to Parkinson's disease. There are mentions of several variants: c.5176G>C (p.R1730W), c.1490C>A, R1628P, and others like Gly2385Arg and R1628P. These are all mutations found in the LRRK2 gene.

I need to identify each mutation mentioned. For example, "c.5176G>C (p.R1730W)" indicates a cDNA change from G to C at position 5176 and a protein change from R to W at position 1730. Similarly, other mutations like Gly2385Arg refer to an amino acid change.

I'll structure the JSON by first identifying the gene as LRRK2. Then, for each mutation variant, I'll note the cDNA changes with their reference and alternate bases, positions, and whether a transcript is specified (which it isn't in this case). For protein changes, I'll include the reference and alternate amino acids and their positions.

Some mutations only have protein-level descriptions, like Gly2385Arg or R1628P. In these cases, the cDNA change details are either not provided or inferred, so I'll mark those as N.D.

I'll ensure that each mutation is listed separately under variants, providing as much detail as present in the text. If any information is missing, I'll use "N.D." to indicate it wasn't mentioned.

Finally, I'll compile all this into a JSON structure, making sure each variant is correctly formatted and all fields are appropriately filled or marked as N.D.
