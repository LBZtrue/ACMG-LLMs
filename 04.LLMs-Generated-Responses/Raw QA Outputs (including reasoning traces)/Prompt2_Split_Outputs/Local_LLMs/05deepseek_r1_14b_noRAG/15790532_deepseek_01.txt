Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to act as a professional medical literature data mining expert. They need help extracting mutation information from paragraphs of medical text. The output should be in JSON format with specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully to spot any mutation-related terms. Scanning the text, I notice several mentions like "L166P", "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", and others which are classic indicators of mutations.

I see that the gene in question is DJ-1, as it's frequently mentioned throughout the context. The main mutation discussed is L166P, found in studies like Olzmann et al. (2004) and Moore et al. (2003). This mutation affects protein stability and function.

There are also other mutations mentioned, such as P28S, which relates to oxidation resistance. The cDNA changes for these aren't explicitly provided beyond the amino acid substitutions, so I'll note that the transcript information is N.D.

I need to structure this into a JSON format as per the user's instructions. Each mutation will be listed under the "variants" array with their respective details. Since some mutations don't have cDNA changes specified, I'll mark those as N.D. to maintain completeness.

Finally, I'll ensure that all extracted information is accurate and only includes what's directly mentioned in the text. Any missing details are supplemented with "N.D." to adhere to the user's constraints.
