Okay, I need to determine whether the given medical literature paragraph contains any mutation-related information and extract the relevant details if it does. The user has provided a list of references in their context, but looking at the input text, they have pasted a selection of these references as points 1 through 46.

First, I should go through each numbered point to see if there are any mentions of mutations or genetic changes. Let's look through them one by one:

33. Bussell R, Eliezer D: Effects of Parkinson's disease-linked mutations on the structure of lipid-associated alpha-synuclein.  
This clearly mentions "Parkinson's disease-linked mutations," so this is a mutation-related point.

34. Kim YS, Laurine E, Woods W, Lee SJ: A novel mechanism of interaction between alpha-synuclein and biological membranes.
No mention of mutations here.

35. Bussell R, Ramlall TF, Eliezer D: Helix periodicity, topology, and dynamics of membrane-associated alpha-Synuclein.
No mutation info.

36. Ulmer TS, Bax A, Cole NB, Nussbaum RL: Structure and dynamics of micelle-bound human alpha-synuclein.
No mutations mentioned.

37. Cooper AA, Gitler AD, Cashikar A, Haynes CM, Hill KJ, Bhullar B, Liu CS, Gitler AD...: Alpha-synuclein blocks ER-Golgi traffic and Rab1 rescues neuron loss in Parkinson's models.
This discusses alpha-synuclein's effect but doesn't mention specific mutations.

38. Gitler AD, Bevis BJ, Shorter J, Strathearn KE, Hamamichi S...: The Parkinson's disease protein alpha-synuclein disrupts cellular Rab homeostasis.
Again, talks about the protein causing disruption but not mutations.

39. Ahmad MF, Ramakrishna T, Raman B, Rao C: Fibrillogenic and non-fibrillogenic ensembles of SDS-bound human alpha-synuclein.
No mutations here.

40. Ferreon AC, Deniz AA: Alpha-synuclein multistate folding thermodynamics: implications for protein misfolding and aggregation.
Discusses folding but no specific mutations.

41. Wright CS, Mi LZ, Rastinejad F: Evidence for lipid packaging in the crystal structure of the GM2-activator complex with platelet activating factor.
No mutation info.

42. Lukiw WJ: Gene expression profiling in fetal, aged, and Alzheimer hippocampus: a continuum of stress-related signaling.
Gene expression but no specific mutations listed.

43. Tandon A, Tan PK, Bannykh S, Banerjee A, Balch WE: Neurotransmitter release from semi-intact synaptosomes.
No mention of mutations.

44. Sakisaka T, Meerlo T, Matteson J, Plutner H, Balch WE: Rab-alphaGDI activity is regulated by a Hsp90 chaperone complex.
No mutation info.

45. Fortin DL, Nemani VM, Voglmaier SM, Anthony MD, Ryan TA, Edwards RH: Neural activity controls the synaptic accumulation of alpha-synuclein.
Discusses alpha-synuclein but no mutations.

46. Mandemakers W, Morais VA, De Strooper B: A cell biological perspective on mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.
No specific mutations mentioned.

So, among all the points provided, only point 33 mentions "mutations" specifically, referring to Parkinson's disease-linked mutations affecting alpha-synuclein structure. However, it doesn't provide details like gene name, cDNA changes, or protein changes—only that there are effects of these mutations.

Therefore, the extracted information should include that a mutation was mentioned but lacks specific details. So in the JSON output, all fields except "Description in input context" would be marked as N.D.

            },
            "Description in input context": "Effects of Parkinson's disease-linked mutations on the structure of lipid-associated alpha-synuclein"
        }
    ]
}
