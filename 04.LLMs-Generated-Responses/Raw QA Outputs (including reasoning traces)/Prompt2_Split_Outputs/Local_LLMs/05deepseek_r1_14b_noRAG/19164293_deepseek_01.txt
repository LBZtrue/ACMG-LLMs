Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature text. Let me start by reading through the provided paragraph carefully.

The paragraph begins with a context about conversion, listing several references (like studies and articles) which don't immediately seem related to mutations. Then there's a discussion of A30P mutant α-synuclein in the figure description. It mentions that when WT seeds are added to A30P monomer, A30P fibrils with their usual conformation are formed.

Looking further down, I see several references (numbered 1 to 49) at the end of the text. Each reference seems to be a citation for a study or article related to various topics like α-synuclein, fibrillization, and prion-like behavior.

I need to identify if any part of this paragraph mentions mutations. The figure description does refer to the A30P mutation, which is a known point mutation in α-synuclein associated with Parkinson's disease. This seems relevant as it directly discusses a specific mutation (A30P) and its effects on fibrillization.

Now, looking at each reference, I see that reference 42 mentions "Effect of A30P Mutation on Fibrillization of β-Synuclein" and references studies about the mutation's role in forming fibrils. This is definitely a mutation context as it discusses how the A30P mutation affects protein behavior.

Other references might be discussing various aspects like seeding, aggregation, or structural studies but without explicitly mentioning mutations. However, since the main focus of the paragraph is on the A30P mutant and its effects, that's the key mutation information here.

I need to extract details about the gene involved (which would be α-synuclein/SNCA), the specific cDNA change (A30P corresponds to c.A30P or similar), and the protein change. The A30P mutation refers to an alanine at position 30 changed to proline.

I should structure this into a JSON format, including gene name, variants with their cDNA and protein changes, and a brief description from the context.

}
