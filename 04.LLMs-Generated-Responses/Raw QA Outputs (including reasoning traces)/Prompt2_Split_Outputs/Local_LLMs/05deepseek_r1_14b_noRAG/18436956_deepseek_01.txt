Okay, so I need to figure out if the given text paragraph contains any mutation-related information and then extract the relevant details as specified. Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.

The context is a collection of various research articles discussing different genes related to Parkinson's disease, including DJ-1 and others like PINK1 and LRRK2. Each entry seems to describe findings from studies on these genes and their mutations causing or associated with Parkinson's disease.

I'll go through each paragraph one by one:

1. **Context: structural...** This is just setting up the structure of the document, not mentioning any specific mutations. So no mutation info here.

2. **Paisan-Ruiz, 2004**: This talks about the PARK8-linked Parkinson's disease and a gene identified in Neuron. It doesn't mention specific mutations but refers to linked genes. No direct mutation data.

3. **Pankratz, 2006**: States that DJ-1 mutations are rare in familial PD. So this indicates mutations exist but may be rare. However, it's more about the frequency rather than specifics. Maybe "mutations in DJ-1 are rare" can be noted.

4. **Polymeropoulos, 1997**: Discusses a-synuclein gene mutation causing PD. Here, they mention the a-synuclein gene having mutations, so specific to that gene and its role. This is mutation info.

5. **Ramirez, 2006**: Talks about ATP13A2 mutations causing hereditary parkinsonism with dementia. So this is another mutation case in a different gene.

6. **Shendelman, 2004**: DJ-1's role as a chaperone and its inhibition of a-synuclein aggregates. No specific mutation mentioned here.

7. **Taira, 2004**: Discusses DJ-1's role in antioxidant stress. Again, no mutations mentioned.

8. **Tang, 2006**: Association between PINK1 and DJ-1 mutations conferring digenic inheritance. So they mention that both genes are involved but don't specify the mutations themselves.

9. **Tao, 2003**: Crystal structure of DJ-1 related to PD. No mutation info here.

10. **Valente, 2004**: PINK1 mutations causing hereditary early-onset PD. So this is another gene with specific mutations contributing to the disease.

11. **Wagenfeld, 1998**: About CAP1 and its role in fertilization, unrelated to PD or mutations. No relevant info.

12. **Wilson, 2003**: DJ-1 structure; no mutation info.

13. **Wishart, 1994**: Methodology on NMR techniques, not related to mutations.

14. **Zhou, 2006**: Talks about oxidation state of DJ-1 affecting its function but doesn't mention specific mutations.

15. **Zimprich, 2004**: LRRK2 mutations causing autosomal-dominant PD with pleomorphic pathology. So this is another gene with mutations linked to the disease.

16. **Malgieri and Eliezer**: The last part seems like a section or conclusion about their work but doesn't specify mutation details.

From this analysis, several paragraphs mention genes where mutations have been found (e.g., DJ-1, PINK1, LRRK2). Some provide specific details about the mutations' effects or their association with the disease, while others just state that mutations exist without specifics. Others discuss findings from studies on these genes but don't delve into mutation specifics.

For each paragraph that discusses a gene where mutations are involved, I'll need to extract the gene name and any mutation information if provided. However, in many cases, like the Paisan-Ruiz study, the mutation details might be in supplementary materials or other sections not covered here. So for each gene mentioned with an association to a mutation, I'll note that mutations exist without specific cDNA or protein changes unless explicitly stated.

For example:

- **Paisan-Ruiz et al., 2004**: Gene is PARK8 (or SNCA?), but the exact mutation details are not provided in this paragraph.
- **Ramirez et al., 2006**: ATP13A2 gene mutations are discussed, but specifics aren't given.
- **Zimprich et al., 2004**: LRRK2 mutations cause autosomal-dominant PD. The exact mutation details might be elsewhere.

So in the extraction, I'll note each gene where mutations are mentioned, and for each variant, indicate that there is a mutation but without specific cDNA or protein changes as they're not detailed here.
