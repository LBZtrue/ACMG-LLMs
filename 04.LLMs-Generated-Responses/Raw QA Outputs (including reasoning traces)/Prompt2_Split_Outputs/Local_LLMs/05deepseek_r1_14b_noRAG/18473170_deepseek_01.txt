Okay, so I need to determine if the given text contains information about mutations and extract relevant details accordingly. Let's start by carefully reading through each paragraph.

The first paragraph mentions that ORIGINAL has found mutations in patients with recessive Parkinson’s disease, specifically noting that these mutants are defective in inhibiting mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. It refers to PINK1 mutants but doesn't provide specific genetic changes like cDNA or protein alterations. So, there's a mention of mutations but without detailed info.

Moving on, the second paragraph discusses studies showing decreased activities of complex I subunits and impaired electron transport chain function in patients with NDUFS1 and NDUFS4 gene mutations. Again, it doesn't specify the exact mutations, just that these genes are involved.

The third paragraph talks about the inhibition of Complex I activity by diphenyleneiodonium but doesn't discuss mutations. The fourth mentions cardiolipin depletion affecting mitochondrial function, also without mutation details.

Looking further, there's a study on mitochondrial dysfunction in PARK6 patients, which relates to mutations in the PINK1 gene, but specifics like cDNA or protein changes are missing. Another paragraph discusses specific mutants of PINK1 and their inability to inhibit cytochrome c release, again without detailed genetic info.

Most other paragraphs cover various aspects of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and enzyme activities without mentioning mutations. Some discuss complex I subunits but not in the context of mutations.

In summary, while there are references to mutations (like PINK1 mutants, NDUFS1/4 gene mutations), none provide specific cDNA or protein changes. Therefore, I'll extract the gene names where mutations are mentioned and note that specific details like cDNA or protein changes aren't provided.
