Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants to extract mutation information from a medical literature paragraph. They're an expert in data mining and needs precise info quickly.

First, I'll read the context provided. It lists several journal articles with abstracts or key points. I need to identify if any mention mutations.

Looking at each point:
1. PINK1 mutations? No, it's about kinase activity.
2. DJ-1 gene: mentions dominant-negative mutation in PD, so that's relevant.
3. LRRK2: no mention of specific mutations here.
4. Pink1/DJ-1 interaction study—no mutations discussed.

Only the DJ-1 entry talks about a dominant-negative mutation causing loss-of-function and PD. So I'll extract gene name as DJ-1, mutation type as dominant-negative, effect on function, and context.

I need to structure this in JSON, using "N.D." where details aren't provided, like specific cDNA or protein changes since they're not mentioned.

```json
{
    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "dominant-negative mutation leading to loss-of-function and contributing to PD"
        }
    ]
}
