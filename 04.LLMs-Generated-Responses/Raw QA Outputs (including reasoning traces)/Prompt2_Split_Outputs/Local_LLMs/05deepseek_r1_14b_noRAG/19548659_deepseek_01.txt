Okay, so I need to determine whether the given text paragraph contains any information related to mutations and then extract the relevant details. The user has provided a set of context with various references and studies, but looking through each entry, most seem to be about Cu(II) binding, structural studies, or other biochemical aspects.

I'll go through each reference one by one:

1. References 1-4 discuss binding studies and thermodynamics without mentioning mutations.
2. Reference 5 talks about the role of R-synuclein in neurodegenerative diseases but doesn't mention specific mutations.
3. References 6 onwards also cover structural aspects, binding affinities, and metal ion interactions without any mutation details.

None of these references explicitly describe a mutation in terms of cDNA or protein changes. They focus more on the function and structure rather than genetic variations.

So, after reviewing all the context provided, I don't find any information related to mutations in the text.
