Okay, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. The user wants me to identify if there are any mutations mentioned and then extract specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and their descriptions.

Looking at the context, it's a paragraph from a study on PARK2 mutations in various cancers. I see several tables that list mutations found in different cancer types, especially glioblastoma and colon cancer. 

In Table 1, there are frequencies of PARK2 copy number loss, but this doesn't directly mention specific mutations. It talks about heterozygous and homozygous losses, which relate to gene dosage rather than point mutations or structural variants.

Now, looking at Table 2, this is where the actual mutation details are listed. Each row specifies the cancer type, genomic position, normal and tumor genotypes, amino acid changes, zygosity, and affected domain. For example, in glioblastoma, there's a mutation at position E344G in the IBR domain.

I need to extract each of these mutations. So for each row under Table 2, I can note down the gene (which is PARK2), the cDNA changes by comparing normal and tumor genotypes, the resulting protein changes, and any additional descriptions.

Let me go through each entry:

1. Glioblastoma: Genomic position 161889928, normal GAG vs tumor GGG leads to E344G. This affects the IBR domain.
2. Another Glioblastoma entry at 162126841 with CGG to CAG causing R275Q in the ring finger domain (this appears twice).
3. A third mutation in glioblastoma at 162542170, ACG to GCG resulting in T173A in the SH2-like domain.
4. Another at 162784379: CGT to TGT causing R42C in the ubiquitin domain.
5. Mutation at 163068687 changing ATA to GTA leads to I2V in the ubiquitin domain.
6. Two entries for exon 8, where C is replaced by T, eliminating a splice site, which likely causes an alternative splicing issue or loss of exon.
7. A truncation mutation at position E395 in glioblastoma cell line T98G.
8. Lung mutations: N254S, D243N, H279P, and A46T in the ring finger domain and ubiquitin domain.
9. Colon cell line DLD1 has two mutations: R420H and A379V.

I should structure each mutation with gene (all are PARK2), cDNA changes from normal to tumor, protein changes, and note if it's heterozygous or homozygous. The domains affected are also important for context.

Wait, I need to ensure that the cDNA changes have both ref and alt alleles along with their positions. For example, in the first entry, GAG (normal) becomes GGG (tumor), so ref is G, alt is A at position 344? Wait, no—the genomic position is given as 161889928, but how does that translate to cDNA changes?

Actually, the way it's presented might not directly give the cDNA's nucleotide positions. It shows normal and tumor genotypes. For instance, GAG becomes GGG, which is a change from AG to GG in the codon. So, the ref allele is G, alt is A at position 344? Or wait, E344G implies that the protein has an amino acid change at position 344: Glu (E) to Gly (G).

So for each entry:

- Gene: PARK2
- variants:
   - For each row in Table 2, create a new variant object.
   - cDNA Change: transcript is N.D. since the text doesn't specify which transcript it's in. Ref and alt are determined from normal vs tumor genotypes. Position would be based on genomic position if applicable, but perhaps the amino acid position is more relevant here.

Wait, the user example used c.248G>A which refers to a specific nucleotide change (cDNA). Here, the text provides amino acid changes and genomic positions but not exact cDNA nucleotide changes. So for this extraction, I might have to infer or note that the cDNA details are incomplete.

For each mutation:

- Extract gene: PARK2
- For variants:
   - cDNA Change: transcript is N.D., since it's not specified.
   - Ref allele and Alt allele from normal vs tumor genotypes.
   - Position may be based on amino acid position (e.g., E344G implies position 344). But genomic positions are given, which might correspond to exons. However, without knowing the exact transcript structure, it's challenging.

Maybe I should just capture the protein changes and note that cDNA info is limited.

In the example provided by the user, the output included cDNA changes like ref G, alt A at position 248 and protein changes with ref G and alt D at position 83. So in our case, each variant's description would include the amino acid change as per the table.

I'll proceed to create a JSON structure where each mutation has:

- Gene: PARK2
- variants array:
   - Each object includes cDNA Change (transcript N.D., ref and alt from normal/tumor, position inferred if possible)
   - Protein Change with ref and alt based on amino acid change
   - Description in input context as given in the table.

I think that's the best I can do given the information. Some entries might have limited cDNA details because it's not provided in the text.
