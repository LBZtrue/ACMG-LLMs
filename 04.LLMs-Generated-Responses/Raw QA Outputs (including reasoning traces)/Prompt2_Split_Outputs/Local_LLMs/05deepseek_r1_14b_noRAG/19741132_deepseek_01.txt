Okay, so I need to help this user who's a professional medical literature data mining expert. They want me to extract information related to mutations from the given text paragraph. The output needs to be in JSON format, and if there's no mutation info, return "N.D.".

Looking at the example provided, it seems they're looking for gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions of the mutations. So first, I'll read through the input text carefully.

The context given is about LRRK2 mutations causing Parkinson’s disease. The paragraph mentions Gly2385Arg, which is a specific mutation. It also refers to other mutations like G2019S in exon 7 and R1441C found in some patients.

I need to extract each gene's info, including the cDNA and protein changes if available. For example, LRRK2 Gly2385Arg doesn't specify the exact position but is a known risk variant. The G2019S mutation affects kinase activity, leading to neuronal toxicity.

So I'll structure the JSON with each gene as an entry under "variants", including their cDNA and protein changes if possible. If some details like transcript or exact position aren't given, I'll mark them as N.D.
