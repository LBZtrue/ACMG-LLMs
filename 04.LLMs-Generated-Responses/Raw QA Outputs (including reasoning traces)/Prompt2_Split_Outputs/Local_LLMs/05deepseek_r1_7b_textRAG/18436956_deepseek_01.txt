Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is an expert in analyzing literature data, specifically looking for mutations related to Parkinson's disease. They provided a context with two paragraphs and asked me to extract information about the mutations.

First, I'll read through the first paragraph carefully. It mentions specific mutations: L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A in the DJ-1 protein. These are all cDNA changes along with their descriptions. The context also explains that these mutations cause structural perturbations, which affect the protein's stability.

Next, I'll move to the second paragraph. It talks about genetic loci associated with familial Parkinson's disease but doesn't mention any specific mutations in this study. So, there are no mutations to extract from here.

Now, according to the user's instructions, if the text contains mutation information, I need to extract gene names and their changes. If not, I should use "N.D." for missing data. 

Putting it all together, I'll structure each mutation with its cDNA change, protein change (if applicable), and description from the context. For the second paragraph, since there are no mutations mentioned, I'll mark Gene, variants, and Protein Change as N.D.
