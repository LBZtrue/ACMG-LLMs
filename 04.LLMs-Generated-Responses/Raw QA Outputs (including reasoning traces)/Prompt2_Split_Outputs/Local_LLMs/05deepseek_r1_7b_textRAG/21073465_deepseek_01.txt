Alright, I need to figure out the role of the Y1699C mutation in the LRRK2 gene based on the provided abstract. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The abstract mentions that mutations in the LRRK2 gene are a major cause of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). It details specific mutations like R1441C/G/H, Y1699C, G2019S, and I2020T. The focus here is on the Y1699C mutation in the COR domain.

The study explores how this mutation affects GTPase activity and interactions within the catalytic core of LRRK2. They found that the GTPase activity decreased similarly to other known mutations like R1441C/G/H and T1348N. Further analysis showed that the Y1699C mutation weakens the dimerization of the ROC-COR domain because it disrupts the intra-molecular interaction between ROC and COR.

Through a competition assay, they demonstrated that the ROC:COR interaction is favored over ROC:ROC dimerization due to this mutation. This suggests that by positioning Y1699 at an intra-molecular interface, the mutation strengthens the interaction between ROC and COR, which locally weakens the overall dimerization of LRRK2, leading to reduced GTPase activity.

So putting it all together, the role of Y1699C is to disrupt dimerization by stabilizing a specific interaction within the catalytic core. This results in decreased GTPase function, which could contribute to PD pathology.

The Y1699C mutation in the LRRK2 gene plays a crucial role in disrupting the dimerization of the protein complex involved in GTPase activity by stabilizing an intra-molecular interaction within the catalytic core.
