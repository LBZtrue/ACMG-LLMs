Okay, so I need to figure out the role of PINK1 mutations in Parkinson's disease based on the provided abstract and introduction. Let me start by reading through both sections carefully.

In the abstract, it mentions that mutations in PINK1 cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PARK6). They found that PINK1 exists as a dimer in mitochondrial protein complexes that move with respiratory chain complexes when tested in sucrose gradients. Importantly, this dimerization and associated complexes aren't affected by the mutations related to PARK6.

Moving on to the introduction, it talks about PD being a neurodegenerative disorder with specific pathological hallmarks like dopaminergic neuron degeneration and Lewy bodies containing mainly a-synuclein aggregates. It also discusses mitochondrial dysfunction in other neurode generative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Amiotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, linking it to processes like protein degradation, oxidative stress, phosphorylation signaling, and mitochondrial function.

Additionally, the introduction mentions that mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in normal aging and various neurodegenerative diseases. In idiopathic PD patients, there was a 30-40% decrease in mitochondrial ETC complex I activity observed in different tissues.

Now, looking at the question: "What are the roles of PINK1 mutations in Parkinson's disease?" From the abstract and introduction, it seems that mutations in PINK1 contribute to the development of PD by affecting mitochondrial function. Specifically, the dimerization of PINK1 with other complexes is disrupted, leading to impaired respiration and ATP synthesis.

However, I don't see any direct mention of a-synuclein or Lewy bodies in relation to PINK1 mutations here. The focus seems to be more on how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to PD rather than the specific aggregation of a-synuclein caused by PINK1 mutations. So while PINK1 mutations do play a role, it's mainly through disrupting mitochondrial complexes rather than directly causing Lewy bodies.

Therefore, the answer should highlight that mutations in PINK1 are implicated in autosomal recessive PD (PARK6) due to disrupting mitochondrial dimerization and associated complexes.

The role of PINK1 mutations in Parkinson's disease is significant as they contribute to the development of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PARK6). Mutations in PINK1 disrupt its dimerization with mitochondrial protein complexes, impairing functions such as respiration and ATP synthesis. This disruption is a key factor in the pathogenesis of PD.
