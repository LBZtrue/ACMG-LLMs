Okay, so I need to figure out if there's any information about mutations in the given paragraphs. Let me start by reading through each part carefully.

First, looking at the abstract and context provided, it talks about resistin hormones in serum and adipose tissue. It mentions two forms of resistin—HMW hexamer and LMW form—and says that LMW has higher bioactivity. It also compares this to adiponectin's multimeric assembly. There's a mention of cysteine-mediated complex formation, which might be relevant, but I'm not sure if it relates to mutations.

Then there are sections about Parkinson's disease (PD). The first paragraph discusses mapping a locus for a rare familial form of PD to chromosome 1p36 and the role of PINK1. It mentions mutations in PINK1 causing the disease, specifically a truncating nonsense mutation and a missense mutation at a highly conserved amino acid. This seems directly related to mutations.

Another part talks about PINK1 being mitochondrially located and its protective effect on cells that's lost with mutations, leading to increased susceptibility to stress. These are clearly mutations affecting the gene involved in PD.

Additionally, there's a discussion of Lewy bodies and other genes like ␣-synuclein, parkin, UCH-L1, DJ-1 involved in PD pathogenesis due to protein misfolding and misfolded proteins causing inclusion bodies. This again points towards mutations as part of the disease mechanism.

So putting this together, there are multiple mentions of mutations in specific genes associated with PD, such as PINK1 having a truncating nonsense mutation and a missense mutation. Other genes involved might have their own mutations but aren't explicitly detailed here.
