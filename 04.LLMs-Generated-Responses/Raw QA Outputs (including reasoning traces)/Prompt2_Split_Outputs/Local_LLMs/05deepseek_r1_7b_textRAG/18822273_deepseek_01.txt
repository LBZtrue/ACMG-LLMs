Okay, I need to determine whether the provided paragraph contains information related to mutations and extract it if possible.

First, reading through the abstract: It mentions a novel homozygous missense mutation in the DJ-1 gene resulting in E163K. That's a mutation with 'c.248G>A (p.G83D)' but here it's different as it's E163K.

The context describes this mutation and its effects on parkinsonism, cognitive decline, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It also talks about the protein's function related to oxidative stress.

In the introduction, mutations in genes like PARK7 (DJ-1) cause early-onset PD. Various mutations including missense have been found.

Looking at the workflow steps:
1. Check for mutation terms.
2. Extract gene name, cDNA changes, and descriptions.

Extracting 'E163K' from the abstract as a missense mutation in DJ-1.

Noticing that the cDNA change isn't directly stated (they only mention E163K), so transcript would be N.D., ref is 163, alt K.

In the protein function section, it says E163K retains some properties but loses protection against oxidative stress. This should note that in the description.

Putting this together into JSON format.
