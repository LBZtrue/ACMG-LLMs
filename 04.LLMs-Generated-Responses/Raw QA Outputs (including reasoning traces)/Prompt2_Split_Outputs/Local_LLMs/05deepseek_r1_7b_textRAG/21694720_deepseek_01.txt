Alright, so I need to analyze this paragraph about the Parkin gene and extract any mutation information it contains. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.

Okay, the first sentence says that Parkin is an E3-ubiquitin ligase in a specific family and is involved in Parkinson's disease. Then it mentions autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism linked to mutations in the parkin gene. That sounds like it's talking about genetic mutations causing the disease. 

Looking further, the abstract describes howParkin functions by inhibiting autoubiquitination when working normally, but pathogenic mutations disrupt this, making it constitutively active. It also talks about ubiquitin binding in the C-terminal region for regulation. All of these points are more about the protein's mechanism and its role in the disease rather than specific mutations.

Wait, the introduction part mentions post-translational modifications by ubiquitin signaling various cellular outcomes. It explains E3 ligases, like RING types which make up 90% of known E3s. But there’s no mention of any specific mutations here either—just general descriptions about how ubiquitination works.

So, going back to the question: I need to extract gene names and any cDNA changes or protein changes along with their descriptions if they exist in the paragraph. In this abstract, I don't see any mentions like "c.248G>A" or specific mutations described for Parkin or other genes involved.

Therefore, since there are no mutation details provided—like specific variants or changes—the correct response is to return "N.D." because it doesn’t contain the required information about mutations.
