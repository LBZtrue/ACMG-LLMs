Okay, so I need to figure out the role of DJ-1 in Parkinson's disease based on the provided abstract and introduction. Let me start by reading through the given text carefully.

The abstract mentions that DJ-1 is a gene product involved in a subset of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). It doesn't explain how mutations affect its function, so I'll note that as unknown but perhaps infer it from the experiments described later.

Looking further into the introduction, it states that DJ-1 is normally expressed in the brain as part of a homodimeric complex and is involved in approximately 1-2% of recessive PD cases. That gives me an idea about its prevalence and role.

The abstract then describes specific mutations:
1. D149A: This mutation renders DJ-1 resistant to caspase-6 proteolysis but doesn't affect its protective phenotype.
2. L166P: This mutation stops DJ-1 dimerization but still allows for caspase-6 proteolysis and doesn't impair the antiapoptotic function.

So, DJ-1 has different mutations that lead to PD through distinct mechanisms—some affecting proteolysis while others disrupting dimerization. From this, I can gather that mutations in DJ-1 can cause PD via various molecular pathways related to cell death or aggregation.

Additionally, the text mentions that DJ-1 is a conserved protein involved in these processes, which supports its role as a key gene product in the disease mechanism.
