Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking for information related to mutations from a given paragraph of medical literature. They provided an example response which I should follow closely.

First, I'll read the abstract carefully. It mentions various isoforms of synuclein—alpha (a), beta (b), gamma (g), A30P mutant, and A53T mutant. The focus is on how these isoforms inhibit PLD2. However, there's no mention of any mutations in this section.

Next, looking at the introduction. It talks about synucleins being expressed in the nervous system and their presence at presynaptic terminals but doesn't discuss any mutations here either.

Now, scanning through the rest of the abstract and introduction for any mutation-related terms or descriptions. The key points are about the inhibition mechanism by these isoforms without specifying any genetic mutations beyond what's mentioned in the Introduction regarding phosphorylation.

The workflow requires extracting gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions only if they're present. In this case, there's no specific mutation details provided like "c.NNN...". The paragraph discusses inhibition mechanisms involving phosphorylation but doesn't list any particular mutations or their positions.

Since all the relevant information about mutations is missing from the provided text, according to the user's instructions, I should return "N.D." for each field. This ensures compliance with their constraints and output format.
