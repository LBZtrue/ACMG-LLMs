Alright, I need to determine if the provided paragraph contains any mutation information related to genes and their changes.

First, I'll look for keywords like gene names, cDNA mutations, protein alterations, or descriptions of mutations. In the given text, I see references to LRRK2 and specific mutants Y1699C and R1441C.

I'll extract:
- Gene name: LRRK2
- Mutations details for each:
  - Y1699C is a codon change from G to C at position 1699.
  - R1441C changes glutamic acid (E) to serine (S) at position 1441.

I'll structure this into the specified JSON format, ensuring all fields are present and accurate.

        },
