Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract information about mutations from the given paragraph about Parkin and mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Let me read through the context again.

The abstract mentions that the Parkin RING domain mutant (C289G) is studied. The authors show that this mutant doesn't redistribute to damaged mitochondria and can't induce mitophagy because of protein misfolding and aggregation. They also mention that adding HSJ1a(DNAJB2a), a chaperone, suppresses the aggregation and inclusion formation but only in J domain-dependent manner for HSJ1a. Importantly, HSJ1a didn't enhance mitophagy mediated by wild-type Parkin.

Hmm, so looking at this, I need to extract mutation details. The cDNA change is C289G. Now, position 289: the transcript isn't given, but ref and alt are G and A respectively? Wait, in the example earlier, they used "c.248G>A (p.G83D)". So here, it's c.289G>A? But I don't see that explicitly stated.

Wait no, the description is: Parkin(C289G) aggregation and inclusion formation were suppressed by HSJ1a(DNAJB2a). So maybe they're referring to a position change from G to A at 289. However, in the example, cDNA changes are shown with "c...", but here it's just described as C289G.

I'm not sure if the exact position is specified beyond that. The user provided an example where they extracted both transcript and protein changes, even if one wasn't present (N.D.). So perhaps for this mutation, since only a codon change is mentioned without specifying which part of the gene it's in, I should note "N.D." for the transcript.

So putting it together: Gene is Parkin. The variant is C289G, so cDNA change would have position 289, ref G to alt A? But wait, if it's not explicitly stated as a codon or which part of the gene (like exon vs intron), maybe I should default to N.D.

Wait no, in the example given, when they didn't have transcript info, they used N.D. So here, since only C289G is mentioned without other details, it's unclear if that refers to a codon or an amino acid change elsewhere. Maybe the best approach is to assume it's a cDNA mutation but with unknown position and type beyond that.

Wait no, looking back: in the example, they had "c.248G>A (p.G83D)". So the transcript info was given as 'c.' followed by position, ref, alt. Here, we only have C289G. I think maybe it's a cDNA change at position 289 from G to A, but since there's no indication of which part (exon or intron), perhaps I should note N.D.

Wait, in the context provided, the mutation is described as C289G without specifying if it's a codon or amino acid. So maybe for this case, position isn't specified beyond that. Hmm, but then how would we represent cDNA change?

Alternatively, perhaps it's just an amino acid substitution at position 289 from G to A, so the variant is C289G.

Wait, in the example, they had a specific position with ref and alt. So maybe here I can write the transcript as 'c.' but without knowing if it's exon or intron. Alternatively, perhaps it's more appropriate to only note that there's an amino acid change at position 289 from G to A.

Wait, no— Parkin is a protein, so the mutation would be in its amino acids. So I should probably represent this as a protein change: Ref:G to Alt:A? But wait, how do they denote which position?

Actually, given that context only mentions C289G and not any further details like codon or exon number, perhaps it's best to note the variant as C289G without specifying transcript info. So in JSON:

{
  "Gene": "Parkin",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "position": "289",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "position": "289",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A"
      }
    }
  ]
}

But wait, in the example, they had 'N.D.' if info wasn't present. So perhaps for this case, since it's a codon mutation but without knowing which part (exon or intron) is changed, maybe I should leave cDNA Change as N.D.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurate to assume that position 289 refers to the coding region and thus can be treated as a codon change. So maybe:

{
  "Gene": "Parkin",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "position": "289",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "position": "289",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A"
      }
    }
  ]
}

But since the context doesn't specify which part (exon vs intron) is being mutated, maybe it's safer to only note if any position info is given. Alternatively, perhaps cDNA change isn't mentioned, so I should use N.D.

Wait, in the example, the user provided detailed cDNA and protein changes. So for this case, since there's a mutation (C289G), but no further details on transcript or exon/intron, perhaps it's better to represent it as:

{
  "Gene": "Parkin",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "position": "289",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "position": "289",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A"
      }
    }
  ]
}

But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe it's a codon change without position info, so cDNA Change would be N.D.

Wait, looking back: in the example, they had both transcript and protein changes. So perhaps for this mutation, since we have C289G but no context on which part of the gene is mutated, I should only include what's given. Since it's a Parkin protein with an RING domain mutant causing issues, the cDNA change would be position 289 from G to A.

So maybe:

{
  "Gene": "Parkin",
  "variants": [
    {
      "cDNA Change": {
        "position": "289",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "position": "289",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A"
      }
    }
  ]
}

I think that's the most accurate based on the context provided.
