Alright, I need to analyze the given text paragraph from a medical literature abstract to extract any mutation information. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The abstract talks about Parkinson's disease (PD) and mentions the accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein as a major component of Lewy bodies. It also discusses autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction as contributing factors. The study shows that activating macroautophagy in neurons with too much α-synuclein leads to massive mitochondrial destruction, loss, and neuronal degeneration.

Now, looking for mutation-related terms: I see "mutations" mentioned at the end, but there's no specific gene or cDNA changes listed. The abstract doesn't provide any details about mutations in genes like β-amyloid (β-APP), Tau, or Parkin, which are often discussed in PD research.

Since the paragraph doesn't specify any mutation information, I'll have to return "N.D." as per the instructions.
