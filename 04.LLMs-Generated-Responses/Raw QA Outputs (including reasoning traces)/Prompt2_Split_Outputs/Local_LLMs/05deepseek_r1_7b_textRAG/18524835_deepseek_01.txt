Okay, I'm going to help this user extract mutation information from a given paragraph about Parkinson's disease and related genes. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.

So, the study looks at fibroblasts from a patient with a homozygous p.W437X mutation in PINK1, which caused early onset of parkinsonism. Interesting. They mention that mtDNA copy number didn't vary and expression levels weren't different either. But then they found new missense mutations: m.12397A.G and m.14319T.C in ND5 and ND6 genes, which are part of complex I.

I need to extract the gene names (PINK1, ND5, ND6), their variants with positions, ref/alt, and protein changes where available. Also, I should note any enzyme kinetic analysis changes mentioned but make sure it's not just a finding without mutation info.

Wait, in the question example, they included cDNA changes as 'c.248G>A' which is another way to write variants. So perhaps for mtDNA mutations, the context uses m.XXXX... notation. I'll need to adjust that accordingly.

So mapping the info: PINK1 has a missense mutation at position 437 (p.W437X). Then in ND5, it's m.12397A.G and p.T21A? Wait, maybe 'm.12397A.G' is cDNA change and the protein would be p.A.G or something else.

Wait, looking at example output: they have "c.248G>A (p.G83D)". So if it's an mRNA position with a codon change, that becomes p.XXXX. But for mtDNA mutations like m.12397A.G, I think the 'm.' indicates mutation in mtDNA at position 12397.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to represent cDNA changes as they are without converting to 'p.' notation? The example uses p. followed by amino acid change for protein mutations. So perhaps if it's a mitochondrial gene and only shows mRNA positions with A or G, I should just list them as m.XXXX... Maybe that's the correct approach.

Wait, but in the sample output provided earlier, they converted 'm.21A' to p.T21A? Or did they use c.248G>A for a protein change. Hmm. It might be more accurate to keep it as mRNA changes unless specified otherwise.

But looking at the abstract: "Sequence analysis of the patient's mtDNA presented two new missense mutations in the ND5 (m.12397A.G, p .12397A.G, p.T21A) and ND6 (m. 14319T.C, p.N119D) genes coding for two subunits of complex I."

Wait, so in the text, they wrote m.12397A.G which is a missense mutation at position 12397 as A to G? So that's cDNA change: position 12397, ref G (from c), alt A?

But earlier I thought 'm.' refers to mtDNA. Then in the example output provided by me, I had ND6 with m.14319T.C and p.N119D.

Wait, perhaps I should structure it as:

For each gene:
- Gene name (PINK1)
- cDNA change at position 437: 'm.437X' which is p.W437X?

No, wait the WT is 'W' so that's just a single letter without codon? Maybe in this context, it's considered an amino acid substitution.

Hmm. I think for this task, perhaps all mutations are presented as cDNA changes and protein implications where applicable. So if a mutation is described with a position (like m.12397A.G), that's the mRNA change: at position 12397 in the cDNA, the base changed from G to A.

Similarly, p .T21A means at position 21 in the protein, it went from T to A? Wait no, 'p.' is not clear. Maybe in this context, each line has both m and p descriptions.

Wait, let me parse:

ND5: two mutations are presented as:
m.12397A.G
p .12397A.G
p.T21A

Hmm, that might be confusing. So the first mutation is at position 12397 in ND5: mRNA change A to G (so m.12397A.G). Then another description p.12397A.G? That seems redundant but maybe for emphasis.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a typo and they meant same mutation twice. Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating; perhaps each mutation is listed once with both cDNA and protein changes if available.

So in the example output, the user provided:

For PINK1: p.W437X (position 437), so that's a single line per gene with only the gene name?

Wait, but maybe it should be structured as 'm.437W' for cDNA change or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to separate the cDNA and protein changes where provided.

In any case, I need to extract:

- Gene names: PINK1, ND5, ND6
- For each gene:
   - cDNA change(s) with position, ref, alt.
   - Protein change(s): p followed by position (if available), but in the text example, they have both m. and p. descriptions.

So for PINK1:

m.437X: So that's at position 437, changing from W to X? Or is it a single letter substitution?

Wait, I'm getting confused because sometimes 'W' can be used in place of 'T' if it comes from the mRNA (which has U instead). But since we're dealing with mtDNA mutations and looking for cDNA changes, perhaps m.437X refers to position 437: changing X.

But wait, no; in the text example provided by the user:

"Sequence analysis of the patient's mtDNA presented two new missense mutations in the ND5 (m.12397A.G, p .12397A.G, p.T21A) and ND6 (m. 14319T.C, p.N119D) genes coding for two subunits of complex I."

So they have m.12397A.G and then also p.12397A.G? That seems like a redundancy. Maybe the first is mRNA change (cDNA), second protein.

Similarly, for ND6: m.14319T.C and p.N119D.

So perhaps in this context:

- For cDNA mutations, it's 'm.xxxx' with ref/alt.
- Then a separate line indicating the protein mutation as 'p.xxx', where 'xxx' is position and alt (if any).

Wait, but looking at ND5: p.12397A.G might be redundant if already m.12397A.G.

Alternatively, perhaps they listed both mRNA and protein mutations for each site, which may not always align because some sites could only have one or the other.

In any case, I need to extract:

- PINK1: position 437 with mutation W (from p.W437X). Since it's a missense, perhaps c.437W.
But wait, in the text they say m.437X?

Wait no, looking at ND5 mutations: 'm.12397A.G' and then 'p .12397A.G'. So first is mRNA change from G to A? Or is it position 12397 in cDNA with base changing from ... Wait, perhaps the user is using m.xxxx for cDNA changes.

Alternatively, maybe each line represents a separate mutation. For example:

In ND5: two mutations:
- At position 12397, A/G (m.12397A.G)
- At position T21, A (p.T21A)

But then for ND6: at 14319, T/C and another protein change.

Wait, perhaps I should structure each mutation as a separate entry with gene name, cDNA pos/ref/alt, and any corresponding protein changes.

So the output would include:

- Gene: PINK1
   - cDNA position 437, ref W (or is it from m.437X?), which seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I should correct my approach.

In the abstract text provided, they say:

Sequence analysis of the patient's mtDNA presented two new missense mutations in the ND5 (m.12397A.G, p .12397A.G, p.T21A) and ND6 (m. 14319T.C, p.N119D) genes coding for two subunits of complex I.

Wait, so they are presenting the mutations as:

For ND5:
- m.12397A.G: which is a cDNA change at position 12397 from G to A.
- p .12397A.G: seems redundant; perhaps it's just noting that protein has same mutation (but with lowercase).
Alternatively, maybe an error in the text.

But for our purposes, I need to extract:

Gene: ND5
cDNA: 12397 A/G

Then another mutation for ND5:
Position T21, change from T to A? But that's a protein level.

Similarly, ND6 has mutations at position 14319 (T/C) and N119D.

Wait, perhaps each gene can have multiple mutations. So for PINK1:

Only one mutation: position W437X, which is likely c.437W.

For ND5:
- m.12397A.G
- p.T21A

For ND6:
- m.14319T.C
- p.N119D

Wait, but the text says "m . 14319T.C", which has a space before the dot; maybe that's a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps they intended it as 'm.14319T.C'.

In any case, I think each gene can have multiple mutations, so for ND5 and ND6 we'll list all their mutations accordingly.

So compiling this information:

- PINK1: position 437 with mutation W.
But wait, in the text it's m.437X? Or is the 'W' part of the mRNA?

No, looking at ND5:

m.12397A.G (so G to A)
p .12397A.G (protein: same position?)

And for ND6:
m.14319T.C
p.N119D

But in PINK1's case, it's m.437X? Or is that a typo?

Wait no, the first paragraph says:

"Sequence analysis of the patient's mtDNA presented two new missense mutations in the ND5 (m.12397A.G, p .12397A.G, p.T21A) and ND6 (m. 14319T.C, p.N119D) genes coding for two subunits of complex I."

So it's:

For ND5:
- m.12397A.G
- p .12397A.G
- p.T21A

Wait that seems three mutations per gene.

But wait, the abstract says 'presented' which might mean all are present in the patient's mtDNA. So for each gene:

ND5:
- m.12397A.G: cDNA change at 12397 from G to A.
- p .12397A.G: same position but protein?
Wait, that doesn't make sense because mRNA is changing.

Alternatively, perhaps the second line for ND5 was intended as a separate mutation:

So maybe it's two mutations in ND5:
- m.12397A.G
- p.T21A

Similarly, ND6 has:
- m.14319T.C
- p.N119D

But in the text provided by the user, it seems that for ND5, there are two mutations: m.12397A.G and p .12397A.G (possibly with a typo), then another mutation p.T21A.

Hmm, perhaps I should structure each gene's mutations as separate entries even if they're in the same line. But to comply with JSON structure, each mutation is its own entry under 'variants'.

So putting it all together:

- Gene: PINK1
  - cDNA change at position 437 (I'm assuming X refers to a change from G or C to T? Or perhaps W stands for something else in this context. Wait no, the text says p.W437X. So maybe that's a separate mutation not captured by m. because it's presented as 'p.W' which might be another notation.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. In ND5: they have m.12397A.G and then in brackets p .12397A.G and p.T21A. Maybe that was a formatting issue. Perhaps it's better to consider:

Each line presents a separate mutation for the gene.

So, the first line is PINK1 with cDNA change at 437.

The next lines are ND5 with two mutations: one as m.12397A.G and another p.T21A? Or perhaps three?

Alternatively, maybe each line after "ND5:" presents a separate mutation for that gene.

So:

ND5:
- m.12397A.G
- p .12397A.G (this is confusing)
- p.T21A

Similarly, ND6 has two mutations: m.14319T.C and p.N119D.

But this would mean three mutations for ND5, which may not be the case as per biological context since complex I usually has two subunits (ND5 and ND6). So maybe each gene only has one mutation in that context.

So perhaps:

PINK1: position 437 with W/X? Or is it position X?

Wait no, looking back at the user's text example for their own PINK1 line was p.W437X. Wait, no—the user didn't provide a specific example but used 'p.' notation.

In any case, perhaps I should extract:

- For each gene mentioned (PINK1, ND5, ND6):
   - Each mutation is either in cDNA or protein form.
But given the text provided by the user, it's better to structure as:

Each gene has its own entry with their mutations.

So for PINK1: position 437, X? Or maybe W?

Wait I'm getting stuck on this. Let me parse the ND5 line again:

ND5:
- m.12397A.G
- p .12397A.G (maybe same position)
- p.T21A

This seems three mutations for one gene, which is strange.

But perhaps it's just a formatting issue in the text and they meant two separate mutations: at 12397 A/G and at T21A.

So I can structure as:

For ND5:
   - cDNA: position 12397 with mutation A/G
   - protein: position T21 with mutation A

Similarly, ND6 has m.14319T.C (so C instead of T) and p.N119D.

So for PINK1:

- gene name: PINK1
   - cDNA: 437 X?

Wait but in the text it's written as p.W437X, which is protein level? Or perhaps that was a typo because W could be from mRNA (U), so m.W437T.

Alternatively, maybe I should disregard and just represent each mutation correctly.

In any case, compiling all this into JSON structure, omitting any non-findings since the user mentioned to put only findings.
