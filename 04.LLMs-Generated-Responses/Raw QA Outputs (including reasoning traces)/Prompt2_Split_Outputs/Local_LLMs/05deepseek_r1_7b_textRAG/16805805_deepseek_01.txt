Okay, I need to extract information about mutations from the given paragraphs of medical literature. Let me start by reading through each section carefully.

First, looking at the abstract provided, it talks about PINK1 gene mutations in Parkinson's disease. Specifically, they've identified PINK1 mutations and mention that PINK1 is localized to Lewy bodies (LBs) in PD brains. However, this part doesn't directly state any mutation details like cDNA changes or protein alterations, so I won't extract anything from here.

Next, looking at the Valente et al. 2004a section: It mentions that PINK1 localizes to mitochondria in mammalian cells but doesn't provide any specific mutation information such as variants or changes. So again, no mutations here either.

Then, in the background paragraph discussing Lewy bodies and mutations, it says that the major constituent is a-synuclein (PARK1) and mentions other proteins involved but does not specify any mutations related to these proteins. Therefore, this section also doesn't provide mutation data.

Putting it all together, none of the paragraphs contain specific information about mutations in terms of gene variants or protein changes. All the relevant details are more about localization and constituent proteins rather than actual mutations.

The provided text does not contain any information related to mutations.
