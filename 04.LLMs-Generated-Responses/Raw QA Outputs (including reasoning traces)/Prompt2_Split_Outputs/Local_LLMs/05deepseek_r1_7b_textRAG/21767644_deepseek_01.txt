Okay, so I need to figure out the role of α-synuclein in the early stages of Parkinson's disease based on the provided text. Let me start by reading through the abstract and introduction carefully.

From the abstract, it mentions that mutations in the N-terminus of α-syn are linked to autosomal dominant PD. It says that most PD patients develop neuropsychiatric symptoms before motor issues. The study then looks at synucleinopathy, which is first detectable in the olfactory bulb and brain stem nuclei during the premotor stage.

The researchers used a conditional transgenic mouse model with human mutant α-syn at region-specific levels. They found that expressing A30P caused increased depots of the protein in dopaminergic neurons without forming fibrillar inclusions, which are usually associated with alpha-syn pathology. They observed reduced dopamine and metabolites in the olfactory bulb, suggesting an impact on neurotransmitter content.

Further experiments showed neurodegenerative changes at ultrastructural levels and hyperactivity related to stress, odor processing, and novelty. This hyperactivity was linked to increased dopaminergic tone in midbrain regions. The conclusion is that A30P α-syn reduces dopamine signaling in olfactory interneurons, which then affects other brain regions.

Looking at the introduction, it talks about α-synuclein being a presynaptic protein involved in Lewy bodies and PD staging. It mentions mutations leading to familial PD, referencing Braak et al., 2003, and lists some families.

So putting this together: the key points are that A30P mutation leads to increased α-syn in dopaminergic neurons without inclusion bodies. This affects neurotransmitter levels (dopamine) and causes behavioral changes like hyperactivity related to stress, odor, and novelty. The ultrastructural changes suggest neurodegeneration and altered dopaminergic function.

I need to structure this information into the JSON format as specified. I'll extract the gene name α-synuclein, note the mutation A30P with its cDNA change (c.30A>Thr?) but in the text it's just given as A30P without specific position or change, so maybe N.D. for position and no cDNA change noted.

Wait, looking back at the abstract: "mutated A30P α-syn expression increased transgenic deposition into somatodendritic compartment of dopaminergic neurons." So they didn't specify a position in the gene but rather that it's mutation A30P. So for cDNA changes and protein change, I can note only what's given.

So Gene is α-synuclein (α-syn), mutations are A30P with no specific cDNA or protein detail beyond "mutated".

I'll structure the JSON accordingly, including the gene name, a variants array with as much info as extracted.
