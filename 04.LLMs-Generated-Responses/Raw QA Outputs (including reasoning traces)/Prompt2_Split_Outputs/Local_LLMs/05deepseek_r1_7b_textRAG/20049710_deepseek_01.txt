Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract information related to mutations from the provided paragraph about PINK1 and its role in Parkinson's disease. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.

The first sentence mentions that "Mutations of the mitochondrial PTEN... induced kinase1 (PINK1) are important causes..." So, they're talking about mutations in the PINK1 gene leading to PD. That seems relevant.

Next, it says "studies on loss of function and overexpression implicate PINK1 in apoptosis, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, impaired dopamine release and motor deficits." But this part is more about the functional consequences rather than specific mutations. So maybe not directly useful for extracting mutation info.

Then, they mention that using fruit fly and mouse models show PINK1 deficiency impacts Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to mitochondrial depolarization and increased sensitivity to apoptotic stress in mammalian cells and tissues. This is more about the phenotypic effects rather than mutations themselves.

Moving on, it says "In Drosophila neurons, PINK1 deficiency affects synaptic function... The reserve pool of synaptic vesicles is not mobilized during rapid stimulation." Again, this seems to describe a phenotype due to PINK1 deficiency but doesn't mention any specific mutations in the gene.

Further, they state that Complex I deficiency can be rescued by adding ATP to the synapse. This relates more to cellular function rather than mutations in the gene.

The clinical relevance part mentions that "human wild type PINK1... can rescue Complex 1 deficiency." This suggests a functional aspect but doesn't provide any mutation data on PINK1 itself.

Looking through the introduction, it talks about PD characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons and presence of Lewy bodies. It also says that PINK1 mutations are important causes, which I've already noted.

So putting this together, the only explicit mention related to mutations is in the first sentence where they refer to "mutations of the mitochondrial PTEN... induced kinase1 (PINK1)." However, they don't provide specific mutation details like cDNA changes or amino acid alterations. They just state that PINK1 mutations are causes.

Since the task is to extract specific gene names with their mutation variants if mentioned, and considering the paragraph doesn't provide any detailed mutation information beyond mentioning it's a cause, I think we should return "N.D." for the variants because there isn't enough detail provided.

The abstract discusses PINK1 mutations as important causes of PD but does not provide specific mutation details such as cDNA changes or amino acid alterations. Therefore, no mutation-related data is extracted.
