Alright, I need to help the user by extracting information related to mutations from a given paragraph of medical literature. The user has specified that they want only what's explicitly stated in the text and nothing made up or speculative.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. It discusses various parkin mutations and their effects on the disease caused by autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (ARPD). They mention different types of mutations: C-terminal deletions and N-terminal missense mutations, each affecting parkin in distinct ways. There's also a note about a smaller parkin species lacking the N-terminal UBL domain.

The user wants to know if there are any mutation details here. I'm looking for terms related to genetic mutations, such as cDNA changes or protein alterations.

Looking at the context:

1. The first paragraph talks about mutant parkins and their pathophysiology but doesn't specify exact mutations.
2. In the second part, they mention four N-terminal missense mutations within the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), which decrease parkin stability and lead to degradation by the proteasome.

So there are specific mutations identified: four N-terminal missense mutations in the UBL domain.

I need to extract this information accurately. I should include the gene involved, which is parkin, specify that it's a missense mutation (protein level), detail each mutation with its position and allele change, and describe their effects.

Putting it into JSON format as per the example given:

- Gene: parkin
- variants array containing:
  - cDNA Change: since only protein changes are mentioned, transcript info is N.D.
  - Protein Change: specify the position (e.g., "ubl1" if that's where UBL starts) and allele change.

I also need to include descriptions of the effects, like decreased stability leading to proteasomal degradation.

Double-checking for any other mutations. The first paragraph mentions C-terminal deletions and N-terminal missense but doesn't detail specific changes beyond general pathogenicity. So only the four in UBL are extractable as per the context provided.
