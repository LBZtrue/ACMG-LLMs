Alright, I'm looking at this user query where they want an expert analysis of literature data focused on mutations related to α-synuclein and Parkinson's disease. The provided abstract discusses various aspects of αS, including its role in Parkinson's, structural changes upon binding to vesicles, aggregation, and the effect of detergents on these conformations.

The user has outlined clear requirements for extracting information: they need a JSON structure that includes gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. If any part isn't mentioned, it should be marked as "N.D."

First, I check if mutations are discussed in the text. The abstract mentions three PD-linked mutations causing early autosomal dominant Parkinsonism but doesn't list specific variants or positions. So, for each mutation, we can only note that they're PD-linked and cause early onset without exact details.

Since no gene symbols (like p.G***) are provided, I mark "N.D." for both cDNA changes and protein changes under those mutations.

The description field is also filled with the information available from the text, which in this case is just stating that these mutations lead to disease. There's no more specific data here.

So, putting it all together, each mutation has a gene (marked as N.D.), cDNA and protein changes marked as N.D., and the description provided accordingly.
