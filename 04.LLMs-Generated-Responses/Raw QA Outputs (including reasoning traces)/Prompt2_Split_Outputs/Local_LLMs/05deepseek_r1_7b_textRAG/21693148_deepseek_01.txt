Okay, I need to determine if the provided paragraph contains any information related to mutations and extract it accordingly.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction carefully.

In the abstract, I see mentions of UCH-L1 protein and a mutation in familial Parkinson's disease. However, these are more about the protein rather than specific mutations within the gene.

Looking further into the introduction, there's a discussion about various proteins associated with PD, such as a-synuclein, parkin, etc., but again, no specific mutations are mentioned here either.

In the context provided under the abstract, I see mentions of mutations like A30P and A53T in different families. These are specific point mutations altering alanine to proline or threonine.

So, putting this together, there's a mention of mutations related to PD but without specific gene names and only through their effects on proteins. The context also refers to a-synuclein mutants affecting UCH-L1 secretion indirectly.
