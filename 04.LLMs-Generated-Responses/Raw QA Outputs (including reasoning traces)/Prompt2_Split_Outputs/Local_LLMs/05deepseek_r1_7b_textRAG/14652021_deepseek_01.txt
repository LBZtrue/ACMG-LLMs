Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the role of DJ-1 mutations in autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism (AR-EOP) based on the provided literature abstracts. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the abstract mentions that mutations in the DJ-1 gene are linked to AR-EOP, similar to how the Parkin gene mutation is associated with sporadic PD. It also states that DJ-1 can be a loss-of-function or gain-of-function variant contributing to the disease.

Looking at the context paragraph, it describes experiments where siRNA downregulates endogenous DJ-1, leading to increased cell death under certain stress conditions like oxidative stress and proteasome inhibition but not pro-apoptotic stimuli. This suggests that DJ-1's loss of function plays a role in neuronal cell death during these stresses.

However, the context doesn't specify any mutations in the DJ-1 gene itself. It focuses more on the functional effects of altering DJ-1 levels rather than genetic mutations causing the disease. There’s mention of over-expressing wild-type or mutant versions affecting cell death, but again, this is about protein function, not actual mutations.

The other paragraph talks about mutations in genes like Parkin (PARK2) and DJ-1 (PARK7). It explains that these are recessive mutations causing the disease. DJ-1 has been identified as a gene involved in Parkinsonism, with its mutations possibly leading to the condition through various mechanisms.

But again, without any specific mutation details provided, like cDNA changes or protein variants, I can’t extract that information from the given context.

So putting it all together, while the literature supports the existence of DJ-1 mutations contributing to AR-EOP and describes how downregulating its function affects cell death, there’s no direct mention of any specific mutations in the gene. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, I should return "N.D." for mutation information since none were explicitly stated.
