Alright, so I need to figure out the role of α-syn oligomers and their ability as ionic channels in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). From the abstract provided, it seems that α-syn forms these channels, which could be a mechanism contributing to PD. There's mention of a specific mutation, E46K, linked to a familial form of PD.

Looking at the introduction, I should check if there are any sections or keywords related to mutations specifically in this context. The abstract discusses α-syn oligomers forming ionic channels and mentions a mutant form E46K with a specific binding domain (GBD). There's also talk about interactions with glycosphingolipids like GM3.

The user is asking for information on mutations, so I need to focus on any gene names or mutation details mentioned. In the abstract, there's a reference to "mutation site 46 linked to a familial form of PD (E46K)". However, it doesn't specify which gene this refers to—does α-syn correspond to a specific gene?

In the context provided, I don't see any gene name associated with E46K. It just says α-syn is involved in channel formation. So if the user is looking for specific mutation details on a gene level, it might not be present here.

Therefore, based on the information given, there's no mention of a specific gene or its mutation (like E46K being in which gene). The focus seems to be more on the structure and function rather than the genetic mutations themselves. So I should respond that there's no NTD data related to mutations in this context.

I need to make sure my answer strictly follows the JSON template, including "Gene", "variants". Since there's no specific gene mutation mentioned, both fields would have "N.D." as placeholders.
