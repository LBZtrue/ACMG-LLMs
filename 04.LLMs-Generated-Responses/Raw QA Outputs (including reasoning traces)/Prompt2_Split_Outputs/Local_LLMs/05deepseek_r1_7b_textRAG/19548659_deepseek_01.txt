Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract about the interaction between Cu(II) ions and human R-synuclein protein, specifically looking at binding constants under different conditions.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want me to extract information related to mutations from the given paragraphs of medical literature. However, in this particular case, the paragraph doesn't mention any mutations. Instead, it's discussing the binding of Cu(II) ions to R-synuclein protein under various conditions.

So, my task here is to determine whether there are any mutation-related terms or descriptions present in the text. If there are, I need to extract that information accurately; if not, I should return "N.D." as specified.

Looking at the provided paragraph, it discusses R-synuclein binding with Cu(II) ions and mentions different binding constants under near-physiological conditions. The mutations mentioned here are A30P, A53T, and E46K in relation to Parkinson's disease. However, these are protein-related mutations or changes rather than genetic mutations like SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms).

The paragraph explains that R-synuclein has three regions: the N-terminal, a nonamyloid β component (NAC), and an acidic C-terminal. It also talks about mutations associated with familial Parkinson's diseases but doesn't specify any cDNA changes or SNP mutations.

Therefore, since there are no explicit mutation terms such as "c.**,***" or "p.***", I conclude that the paragraph does not contain information related to mutations in the context of genetic variations.

Hence, according to the user's requirements, if the input text doesn't contain any mutation-related information, the appropriate response is "N.D.".
