Okay, I need to analyze the provided text paragraph from a medical literature study to extract information related to mutations in a-synuclein. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract and context.

The abstract mentions that mutations in a-synuclein have been identified in autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically, it refers to A30P and A53T mutations but doesn't provide detailed descriptions beyond that.

Looking at the paragraph with the microarray data, it discusses transcriptional changes after a-synuclein transfection. It mentions gene products like stress response factors, apoptosis-inducing molecules, etc., but no specific mutation information is provided here.

In another part of the text, there's discussion about altered expression of dihydropteridine reductase and confirmation of mRNA downregulation for certain genes by wild-type a-synuclein. However, this doesn't detail any mutations either.

Since the user is specifically looking for mutation information related to a-synuclein in PD, I should check if there are any explicit mentions of such mutations here. The text talks about A30P and A53T mutations as part of the study but describes them generally without specifics like position changes or amino acid substitutions.

Therefore, while the study indicates that these mutations exist, it doesn't provide detailed mutation descriptions beyond their mention in the context of a-synuclein's role. Hence, I can conclude that there isn't enough explicit mutation information provided to extract specific details.
