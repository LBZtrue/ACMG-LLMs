Okay, so I need to figure out the role of ␣-synuclein and any mutations related to it from the given abstract. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.

The first paragraph talks about a novel mutation E46K in one of the KTKEGV repeats in the amino-terminal region of ␣-synuclein. It says this region, especially Glu residues, is important for polymerization into amyloid fibrils. They found that this mutation increased the ability to form fibrils but less than A53T. Also, substituting Glu 46 with Ala had an effect on assembly, leading to different ultrastructures.

The second part discusses Glu 83 in the sixth repeat, which is critical for filament assembly. Mutating it to Lys or Ala increased polymerization but messed up some mature amyloid properties.

Then there's a mention of A53T mutation being more impactful than E46K, especially when compared to other possible mutations like E46K. They also link the relative effects of these mutations to the age of disease onset and support the idea that abnormal ␣-synuclein polymerization causes pathological inclusions leading to disease.

Looking at the background info about ␣-Syn 1, it's a small protein with six KTKEGV repeats in its amino-terminal half. But I don't see any mutations mentioned there; it just describes the structure.

So focusing back on the question: extracting mutation information related to ␣-synuclein. The abstract mentions E46K and Glu 83 mutations but doesn't provide their exact positions beyond numbers like 46, K, 83, etc., or specify amino acids in terms of p.xxxx (like G83D). It just states that some mutations increased polymerization but affected amyloid properties.

I need to represent this information accurately. The user wants a JSON with gene name, variants, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

From the abstract: E46K is in the amino-terminal region of KTKEGV repeats. Glu 83 mutation (to Lys or Ala) affects polymerization but perturbs amyloid properties.

So for each mutation:

E46K:
- Gene: α-synuclein
- Position: E46, K? Or is it Glu at position 46?
Wait, the abstract says E46K as a substitution. So in cDNA terms, position 46 changes from G to K.
Protein change would be p.Glu46Arg or something similar.

Similarly, for Glu83 mutation: position 83, changing to Lys (p.Lys) or Ala (p.Ala). The abstract doesn't specify the amino acids but just mentions it's a substitution.

So I'll structure each variant with these details, ensuring that cDNA Change and Protein Change are properly filled where possible. Since exact alt codes aren't provided beyond K and L/Ala, I can use placeholders or assume based on common substitutions (like G to A for alanine).

Finally, putting it all together in JSON format as per the example.
