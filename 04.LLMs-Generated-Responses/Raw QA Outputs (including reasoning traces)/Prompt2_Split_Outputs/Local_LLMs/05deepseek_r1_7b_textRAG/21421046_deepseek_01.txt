Alright, so I need to figure out the role of PINK1 mutations in Familial Type 6 Parkinson's Disease (PARK6) based on the provided abstract and introduction. 

First, looking at the Abstract, it mentions that mutations in the PINK1 gene cause PARK6, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. The study focuses on how PINK1 acts as a mitochondrial kinase to protect SN dopaminergic neurons by maintaining ΔΨm (membrane potential) and mitochondrial structure.

The Introduction states that patients with PARK6 exhibit early-onset symptoms and have autosomal recessive inheritance [1]. It references the abstract, so I can assume the key points there are also covered here.

Now, focusing on extracting mutation information from these paragraphs. The abstract doesn't specify any particular mutations in PINK1, just stating its role and how it affects the neurons. There's no mention of specific cDNA changes or protein alterations related to PINK1.

In the Introduction, again, there's no detailed information about mutations. It talks about autosomal recessive inheritance but doesn't give specifics like which exons are involved or any particular genetic changes in PINK1.

Since both the Abstract and Introduction don't provide specific mutation details for the PINK1 gene causing PARK6, I can conclude that the literature does not contain mutation-related information regarding this particular case. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, I should return "N.D." because there's no relevant mutation data present.
