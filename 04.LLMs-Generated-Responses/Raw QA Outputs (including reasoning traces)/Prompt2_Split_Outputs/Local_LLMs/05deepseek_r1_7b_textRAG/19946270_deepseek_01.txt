Okay, so I need to analyze the given abstract and main text to extract mutation information related to PARK2. Let's start by reading through both sections carefully.

In the abstract section, it mentions that mutations in the PARK2 gene are linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease. They identified multiple somatic mutations and intragenic deletions of PARK2 in cancers. These mutations occur in the same regions as germline mutations causing familial PD. The cancer-specific mutations reduce the E3 ligase activity of PARK2, leading to issues with cyclin E ubiquitination and mitotic instability.

Looking at the main text, it describes how mutations affect different tissues beyond just neurons, including lung, colon, and testes. PARK2 interacts with other proteins like UBCH7 and UBCH8, which are involved in monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of target proteins. This activity can influence proteasome-mediated degradation.

Now, focusing on the mutation part: The abstract talks about cDNA changes but doesn't specify exact mutations. It just mentions that mutations cause loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra for familial PD. However, there's no detailed description like "c.xX>Y (p.ABCD)" here.

In the main text under the Methods section, I see a note about identifying PARK2 as a tumor suppressor on chromosome 6q25.2-q27 through mutations in cancer and family studies. But again, this is more about the genomic location than specific mutation details.

Since the provided context doesn't include any specific mutation variants (like cDNA changes or protein alterations), I can only conclude that while PARK2 has mutations associated with these disorders, there's no detailed mutation information here to extract beyond knowing it's involved in cancers and PD. Therefore, according to the user's requirements, this should be marked as "N.D." because no specific mutation details are present.
