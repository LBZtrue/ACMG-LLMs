Alright, I need to analyze the given paragraph from a medical literature excerpt and extract information related to mutations. The user has provided an abstract and introduction about mutations in the LRRK2 gene leading to Parkinson's disease.

First, I'll read through the context carefully. The abstract mentions that mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause dominant inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). These mutations are found throughout the gene, including the kinase domain, but it's unclear if the kinase activity is important for the pathogenic effects. Key findings include increased tendency to form inclusion bodies and neuronal cell death after expressing mutant protein.

The introduction provides more context: LRRK2 mutations account for 1-6% of cases in PD, particularly in apparently sporadic cases. There's a loss of striatal 18F-DOPA PET signal consistent with loss of presynaptic neurons in SNpc. Lewy bodies are often associated with these cases.

Now, I need to identify mutation-related terms. The abstract mentions mutations throughout the gene but doesn't specify particular changes like point mutations or deletions. There's no exact cDNA change or protein alteration described. The introduction also refers to mutations causing pathogenic effects and cellular phenotypes without detailing specific genetic variations.

Since there's no mention of specific mutations, such as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) or indels (insertions/deletions), the extracted information should indicate that mutation data is not available from this text. Therefore, I'll return "N.D." for gene name and variants.
