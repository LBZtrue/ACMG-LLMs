Alright, I need to extract information related to mutations from the given paragraph about α-Synuclein and Parkinson's disease. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll read the abstract thoroughly. It mentions three point mutations in αSyn that are associated with familial Parkinson's disease: A30P, E46K, and A53T. These are specific changes in the gene sequence, so they qualify as mutations.

Next, looking at the background section, it describes these mutations' effects on amyloidogenicity and vesicle-binding activity but notes there’s no clear correlation between them and neurodegeneration. This tells me that while the mutations exist, their direct impact isn't straightforward.

The abstract also references recent data about cellular toxicity being caused by a soluble oligomeric species of α-Syn which is distinct from both soluble monomers and amyloid forms. It mentions that the rate of formation of this oligomer correlates with the disease-associated mutations when considering 20S proteasome cleavage and liposomes.

I should ensure I only include information directly related to mutations, such as their names and descriptions. The other details like the role in neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity are not part of the mutation data itself but relate to the proteins' functions after mutation.

So compiling all this, the mutations are A30P, E46K, and A53T with their respective cDNA changes. I'll structure each variant as per the example provided, including 'cDNA Change' and 'Protein Change' sections for each.
