Alright, I'm going to analyze the provided text paragraph from the abstract about E3 ubiquitin ligases and parkin mutations. The user wants me to extract mutation information if present.

First, I'll read through the context carefully. I notice sections that talk about specific mutations in the parkin gene. There's mention of K48A and R42P mutations, which are point mutations. These seem relevant because they're actual changes in the genetic code.

I need to extract the gene name first. The context mentions "the protein with two causative disease mutations (K48A and R42P)" but doesn't specify which gene these mutations are in. Without the gene name, I can't provide accurate mutation details, so according to the instructions, if the gene isn't mentioned, I should mark it as N.D.

Next, looking at the context again, there's a section where they discuss the protein ubiquitin and its structure, but that doesn't relate to mutations. Similarly, other parts talk about the parkin E3 ligase function without mentioning specific mutations beyond K48A and R42P.

Since I can't find an explicit gene name associated with these mutations in the provided context, I have to conclude that there's no mutation information related to a specific gene (like TP53 or another) mentioned. Therefore, both the gene name and the cDNA/protein changes for K48A and R42P would be N.D.

I'll structure the output accordingly, ensuring it follows the JSON format specified by the user.
