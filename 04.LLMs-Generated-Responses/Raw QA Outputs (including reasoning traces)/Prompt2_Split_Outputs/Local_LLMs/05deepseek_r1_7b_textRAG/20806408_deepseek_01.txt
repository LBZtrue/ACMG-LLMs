Alright, so I need to analyze the provided abstract to extract mutation information related to DJ-1 protein. Let me read through it carefully.

The abstract starts by mentioning that mutations in the gene encoding DJ-1 protein are causal for autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism. Then there's a study reporting two novel pathogenic homozygous mutations: one is an L10P missense mutation and another is a P158 deletion. It also mentions that these specific effects on protein function haven't been studied yet.

Next, the study assesses four variants: L10P, P158DEL, L166P (which was pathogenic), along with the wild-type (WT) protein. They looked at protein stability, dimerization, solubility, subcellular localization, and protective function.

The findings show that WT, L10P, L166P, and P158DEL all have reduced protein stabilities. Proteasome-mediated degradation is a factor in each case. Unlike the L166P variant, both L10P and P158DEL retain dimerization ability with WT but can't form homodimers on their own.

Regarding solubility, these variants show altered profiles on size-exclusion chromatography and lower solubility compared to WT. In some cases, adding MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor) worsens the solubility issues.

Cells expressing L10P DJ-1 are more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, suggesting toxicity under proteasome stress conditions.

Putting this together, I need to extract the gene name, any cDNA changes if present, protein changes, and descriptions. The mutations in question are L10P (amino acid substitution) and P158DEL (residue deletion). No cDNA information is provided, so that field remains N.D.

So, my JSON should include the gene "DJ-1", a variants array with each mutation type. For L10P, it's an amino acid change from whatever to P; same for P158DEL, which deletes residue 158.

The extracted information is as follows:
