Alright, I need to determine if the provided text contains any information related to mutations and extract it accordingly.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. The text discusses how D. radiodurans bacteria are affected by high concentrations of Mn²⁺, leading to impaired radioresistance without impacting their viability under normal conditions.

It mentions that when exposed to 100 M Mn²⁺, bacteria form aggregates with noncompartmentalized structures and lose DNA toroids in some cases, showing a dispersed nucleoid structure. This suggests changes in the bacterial genome's packaging but doesn't explicitly mention any mutations or genetic alterations related to specific genes.

The abstract references repair mechanisms involving RecA proteins—specifically an efficient RecA-independent pathway followed by a RecA-dependent phase. However, this pertains to DNA repair processes and not directly to mutations.

There are also mentions about multiple genome copies and packaging differences, which could imply genetic variations but without any specifics on mutation types or locations.

Since the text doesn't detail any specific gene alterations, mutations in terms of cDNA changes, protein modifications, or detailed descriptions of genetic mutations, there's no direct information related to mutations from this paragraph.

Therefore, according to the user's requirements, I should return "N.D." because no mutation-related data is present.
