Okay, so I need to figure out if the given paragraph contains any information about mutations and extract that if it does. Let me read through the abstract carefully.

The abstract talks about increased levels of R-syn, both wild-type and a mutant A53T version. It says this is linked to Parkinson's disease and affects mitochondrial function. They used 2-D difference in-gel electrophoresis for their study but didn't mention any mutations there.

Moving on to the introduction, it discusses the diagnosis of PD around age 65, affecting about 1-3% of people over that age. It mentions loss of dopaminergic neurons and that motor function loss isn't apparent until around 70% of those cells are lost. This suggests an asymptomatic early stage in some cases.

But wait, the user is looking for mutation information specifically. The abstract doesn’t talk about any mutations other than R-syn being mutant A53T. However, when they performed Western blot analysis, they found altered levels of proteins like HSPA9, NDUFS1, DLAT, and ATP5A1. They also saw a reduction in OXPHOS 1 activity.

So the mutation here is A53T in R-syn, but I don't see any other mutations mentioned beyond that. The rest seems to be about altered protein levels due to Rsyn changes rather than specific point mutations.

Therefore, the only mutation-related information is the A53T change in R-syn. I should extract that without any additional data since nothing else in the text points to another mutation.
