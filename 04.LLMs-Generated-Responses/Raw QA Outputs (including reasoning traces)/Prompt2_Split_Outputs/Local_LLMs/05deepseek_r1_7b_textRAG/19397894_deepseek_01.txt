Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is an expert in literature data mining, specifically looking for mutations related to LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease. They provided a context with an abstract and introduction discussing two PD-associated mutations, I2020T and G2019S.

First, I need to identify if the text contains mutation information. The abstract mentions these two mutations: I2020T and G2019S in the activation loop of LRRK2. That's a clear indicator of mutations are present.

Next, extract each mutation's details. For I2020T:
- cDNA Change: Looking at position 2020, it changes from I to T.
- Protein Change: From Asp (D) to Tyr (Y), as the activation loop is involved in kinase activity.
- Description: The abstract states this mutation alters kinase activity and has higher ATP affinity.

For G2019S:
- cDNA Change: Position 2019 changes from G to S.
- Protein Change: Alanine to Serine, again in the activation loop due to its role in kinase activity.
- Description: The mutation is associated with higher kinase activity and altered ATP binding affinity.

Now, structure this information into JSON as per the user's instructions. Ensure each gene has a list of variants, each with cDNA change (transcript/ref/alt) and protein change (ref/alt). Also, include descriptions for clarity without adding speculative data.

I double-check that no other genes or mutations are mentioned to maintain accuracy. Everything seems covered, so the JSON should be precise and complete.
