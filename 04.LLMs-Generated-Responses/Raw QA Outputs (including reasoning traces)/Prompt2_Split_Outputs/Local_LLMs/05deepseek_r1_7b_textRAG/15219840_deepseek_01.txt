Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given paragraphs about DJ-1 mutations related to Parkinson's disease. The user provided an abstract and some context about their study on different DJ-1 mutants.

First, let me look at each paragraph carefully.

In the first part of the abstract, they mention that all mutants except L166P make homodimers or heterodimers with wild-type DJ-1. They have a mutant called L166P which can't scavenge reactive oxygen species and doesn't prevent H2O2-induced cell death. This seems to describe mutations but more about their interactions rather than specific mutation details.

Then, looking further down, they talk about each mutant: M26I, R98Q, D149A, and L166P. Each has a different cDNA change and protein change mentioned as C106S for protease activity in one case. These are specific mutations.

So I can extract the gene (DJ-1), each variant's position, transcript/ref/alt, and protein changes for each mutant.

But wait, D149A is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) because only position 149 is altered from A to G? Or does it change the DNA sequence?

Wait no, in the context provided, they describe M26I as an in-frame mutation with I inserted, R98Q as a point mutation, D149A as a single nucleotide deletion. C106S for protease activity might be another form.

So each mutant has their own details. Now, how do these mutations look?

M26I: position 26 in cDNA changes from I (insertion) so the variant is M26I.
R98Q: R to Q point mutation at position 98.
D149A: D to A point mutation? Wait no, it says "D149A" meaning position 149 changed from D to A. But wait, in the context above, they mention L166P and C106S.

Wait, actually looking back at the user's context:

They write: "We analyzed other mutants of DJ-1 found in Parkinson's disease patients, including M26I, R98Q, and D149A, as well as L166P . We first found that all of the mutants made heterodimers with wild-type DJ-1, while all of the mutants except for L166P made homodimers."

Then later: "NIH3T3 cell lines stably expressing these mutants of DJ-1 showed that cell lines of L166P and C106S... had no activity to scavenge even endogenously producing reactive oxygen species. These cell lines also showed that all of the mutants had reduced activities to eliminate exogenously added H 2 O 2 and that these activities, except for that of D149A, were parallel to those preventing H 2 O 2 -induced cell death."

So in this case, each mutant has specific changes:

M26I: position 26 in cDNA is I (insertion) → M26I.

R98Q: R at position 98 changing to Q → R98Q.

D149A: D at position 149 changing to A. But wait, that would mean the variant is D149A? Or maybe it's a deletion of one nucleotide, making it shorter. So if position 149 was originally D and now it's A, but perhaps in cDNA terms.

Wait no, I'm getting confused here because DNA changes are often described as 'N' for no change, '+' for insertions or deletions (indels). So M26I would be an insertion of one nucleotide at position 26. Similarly, R98Q is a replacement: replacing R with Q.

D149A could either mean substitution (changing D to A) or if it's indel-based like D149A (losing some bases). Wait, actually, in the context they have L166P which is an "L" at 166 changed to P. So that would be a point mutation.

Wait no, hold on: D149A may indicate a deletion of one or more nucleotides. Let me try to parse this correctly.

In the first paragraph, M26I has cDNA change as I in position 26, so variant is M26I → which would be an insertion (denoted by 'I') at that position.

Similarly, R98Q: Q replaces R (point mutation).

D149A: A replaces D? Or perhaps it's a deletion. Wait, actually, in the context of mutations in proteins, sometimes they are denoted as single nucleotide changes, others as indels.

But looking at L166P: "L166P" would mean position 166, Leucine changed to Proline—point mutation.

So D149A could be a point mutation from D (Ala) to A? Wait no, that's the same amino acid. So perhaps it's an indel-based change: deletion of one or two nucleotides.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look back at the user's context:

They have "M26I" which is a variant with insertion, so cDNA Change would be transcript as M26 (position) and alt as I. Similarly, R98Q: position 98 from R to Q.

D149A: position 149 changed from D to A → but that's same amino acid, so perhaps it's an indel? Wait no, because in the example they have L166P which is a substitution. So maybe D149A is a point mutation where D (Ala) becomes A (Leu)? Or was it a deletion?

Wait I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, looking at the output from their JSON example: when they had c.248G>A (p.G83D), that's an insertion of A in the cDNA.

So M26I would be position 26 in cDNA with I inserted → so transcript is M and alt is I? So in JSON, it would be "cDNA Change": {"transcript": "M", "ref": "26", "alt": "I"}.

Wait no: wait the user's example shows that for a variant like p.G83D (which is position 83, G to D), but M26I would have an insertion at cDNA position 26. So in JSON:

"variants": [
    {
        "cDNA Change": {
            "transcript": "M",
            "ref": "26",
            "alt": "I"
        },
        ...
    }
]

So, to extract each mutant's details:

1. M26I: position 26 in cDNA has I inserted (inclusion of an extra nucleotide). So transcript is M, ref is 26, alt is I.

2. R98Q: Q replaces R at position 98 → point mutation.

3. D149A: A replaces D or maybe a deletion? Wait in the context they have L166P which is substitution of Leu to Pro. So for D149A, if it's an insertion (e.g., A inserted) then transcript would be D at 149 and alt as A.

But wait no: "D" is a codon; in protein terms, D corresponds to Ala. If the variant is D149A, that might mean position 149 of the protein has an alanine (Ala) instead of arginine (Arg), but if it's substitution from D (which is also Ala?), so maybe it's a substitution.

Wait no: DNA sequences are based on codons. The DNA sequence at position 149 in the gene may have been, say, GAT for Ala, and now has an insertion or deletion.

But perhaps it's better to represent it as a point mutation from D (Ala) to A? But that would be same amino acid. So maybe this is an indel: so if position 149 had one more nucleotide inserted, making the codon change.

Alternatively, if it's M26I where I was inserted at cDNA position 26, then D149A could mean a deletion of some bases, resulting in shorter mRNA. So for example, if it's a deletion (length -1), so transcript would have one less base.

But how is this represented? In the example they had p.G83D which was point mutation from G to D at position 83. Similarly, R98Q is same: Q replaces R in position 98. So for D149A, perhaps it's a substitution of D (Ala) with A—wait but that would be same amino acid.

Wait no, perhaps I'm misreading the context. Maybe they have D149A meaning position 149 has an insertion? But then "D" in cDNA could mean something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a missense mutation (point mutation) where DNA sequence changed from ...T to ...something else.

Wait perhaps I should look at the code provided by the user. In their JSON example, they have:

"c.248G>A (p.G83D)" → which maps cDNA change G→D as a point mutation at position 83.

So similarly, M26I is an insertion of I at position 26 in cDNA.

R98Q would be Q replacing R at position 98.

D149A: if it's a substitution from D (Ala) to A—wait but that doesn't make sense since D and A both code for Ala. Alternatively, maybe it's an insertion or deletion of one nucleotide.

Wait in the context provided earlier, they have L166P which is point mutation P. So perhaps all single letters after 'L' are substitutions: e.g., P for Proline.

Similarly, M26I would be an insertion (probably as per their explanation). For D149A, if it's a substitution from D to A at position 149, but since both code for Ala, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is due to the deletion of one or two nucleotides.

Alternatively, maybe the cDNA change in D149A is just an insertion? But it's unclear without more context.

Wait actually, looking back: M26I → cDNA position 26 has I inserted. So transcript at 26 would have 'M' as codon and alt with 'I' added.

Similarly, R98Q means position 98 in mRNA is R replaced by Q (point mutation).

For D149A: perhaps it's a substitution from D to A? But that doesn't change the amino acid. Alternatively, maybe an insertion of 'A' at cDNA position 149.

But without knowing, I'll assume that each variant has its own cDNA and protein change as per their context.

So for each mutant:

M26I: position 26 in cDNA inserted I → transcript M, alt I.

R98Q: position 98 from R to Q → point mutation.

D149A: if it's a substitution or an insertion. Given that L166P is a single letter (P), so maybe D149A is substitution of A for something else? Or perhaps it's an indel?

Wait the context mentions "C106S" for protease activity, which would be position 106 changed to S. So similar pattern.

Therefore, I think each variant has a cDNA change (maybe insertion) and a protein change. So D149A is position 149 with something: if it's an insertion of A, then transcript at that position includes the 'A' added.

But given confusion in mapping whether substitution or indel, perhaps better to assume as per context:

M26I: cDNA position 26 has I inserted (like adding a nucleotide).

R98Q: point mutation from R to Q.

D149A: likely an insertion of A at position 149 in the cDNA, resulting in transcript D becoming DA?

But that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps it's just substitution with same amino acid but different codon? Unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe D149A is a missense mutation where DNA has changed from, say, T to A insertion or something else.

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed by extracting each variant as per their positions and changes.
