Okay, so I need to analyze this abstract paragraph and extract any information related to mutations. Let me read through it carefully.

The abstract starts by talking about Parkin gene product causing autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism. It mentions murine Uld as part of the 26S proteasome complex with Rpn10, which is important for ubiquitin ligase E3 activity. Then they determined the X-ray structure of murine Uld and did MD simulations on wild-type Uld and five mutants.

Looking at the mutations mentioned: K27N, R33Q, R42P, K48A, V56E. These are all single nucleotide changes in the protein sequence. The description says that these mutations were identified from AR-JP patients' genomes. So each of these is a mutation.

For each variant, I need to extract the gene name (which seems to be Parkin?), cDNA change with transcript/ref/alt and position, and the corresponding protein change if available.

Wait, in the abstract it says "five mutants... identified from AR-JP patients". But then under simulations, they mention mutations K27N, R33Q etc. So each of these is a mutation to be listed.

So I think each variant corresponds to one mutation. Let's list them:

1. K27N: position 27 in cDNA coding sequence changes from G to N? Or maybe the amino acid change?
Wait, looking at the context, it says "the side chain NηH of Lys27 on α1 helix was crucial... through three hydrogen bonds." So that's a mutation K27N. In the gene context, is Parkin the gene name?

Yes, so Gene would be Parkin. The cDNA change: position 27, transcript (cDNA) ref G to alt N? But wait, in the abstract it doesn't specify whether this is from cDNA or protein. Hmm.

Wait, actually, looking at the example provided by the user:

In Example 1, when a c.248G>A mutation is found, they note it as "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" where G and A are transcript changes and D is the protein change.

So in our case, K27N would be c.27K>N? But wait, does it specify which part of the gene?

Wait, actually, looking again: "Murine Uld consists... The MD simulations showed the K27N mutation increases structural fluctuation..." So K27 is a position in Uld. Since Uld is part of Parkin protein, perhaps the gene name would be Parkin.

But in the given example, they used "Gene" as the gene name, and then for cDNA changes: transcript, ref, alt, pos; Protein change has ref, alt, pos.

In our case, each mutation K27N etc., is a single nucleotide change. So I need to note each one with position in the cDNA or protein?

Wait, but since it's Uld, which is part of Parkin, perhaps they are considering it as part of the gene's product.

So for each variant:

K27N: position 27 in cDNA (c.27?) changing from K to N? Or wait, maybe in the context of Parkin protein.

But the example shows "c.248G>A", so transcript-based numbering. So here, perhaps each mutation is a single nucleotide change at that position.

Therefore:

K27N: c.27K>N

R33Q: c.33R>Q

Similarly, R42P: c.42R>P; K48A: c.48K>A; V56E: c.56V>E.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the numbering system here because it's a protein and they're talking about amino acids. So perhaps each position refers to an amino acid?

So for example:

K27N: Amino acid at position 27 is lysine (K), changing to arginine (N)?

But in the context of the example, c. denotes cDNA-based numbering.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing because Uld is part of Parkin's protein product, but they're referring to mutations as K27N etc., which might be in the amino acid sequence.

In any case, based on the example provided, I think each mutation should be presented with their position and change from ref (reference) to alt (alternative).

But since the abstract doesn't specify whether it's cDNA or protein level, but in the context of mutations, it could refer to either. However, since these are single nucleotide changes, it's likely at the cDNA level.

So each mutation would be noted as:

c.N[Position]X[Y]

Where N is the position, X is ref (from which base), Y is alt.

But in our case, only positions and mutations are given: K27N, etc. So perhaps we need to reconstruct it from that.

Alternatively, maybe each mutation's change can be inferred as:

For K27N: position 27, changing from lysine (K) to arginine (N)?

But without the reference, it's tricky. Hmm.

Wait, but in the context of the example given by the user, when a c.248G>A mutation is found, they note p.G83D, where G is the reference and D is the amino acid change. So similarly, K27N would be position 27, changing from K to N? But that's arginine.

Wait, lysine (K) changes to arginine (R)? Wait no, N is arginine too.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe each mutation is a single nucleotide change at a specific position in the cDNA sequence.

So for K27N: Position 27 in the coding strand changes from G to N? Or maybe it's the amino acid changing from K (lysine) to R (arginine)? Wait, no, because arginine is R. Maybe the user just used "K" and "N" as codes.

Alternatively, perhaps each mutation can be represented with their position in cDNA and the change as per the reference.

But since the abstract doesn't specify the exact bases being changed, only that these are single nucleotide mutations from AR-JP patients, I think we should assign arbitrary ref/alt for demonstration purposes. But wait, no—probably better to note that data is missing.

Wait, but in the example provided by the user, they have specific cDNA changes and protein changes if available. So perhaps each mutation here can be listed with their position and change as per the context.

Alternatively, since the abstract doesn't specify which nucleotide is changing (like G to A), maybe we should leave that part blank because it's not provided. But in the example, they had "c.248G>A", so perhaps for each mutation here, I can note their position and the change as given.

Wait, let me look again at the abstract paragraph:

"The MD simulations showed the K27N and R33Q mutations increase the structural fluctuation of these β strands including the α1 helix . Reversely, the V56E mutant restricted the spatial flexibility at the periphery of the short α2 helix by the interactions between the polar atoms of Glu56 and Ser19 residues . However, a large fluctuation of β4 strand with respect to β5 strand was induced in the R42P mutant, because of the impossibility of forming paired hydrogen bonds of Pro for Arg42 in wild Uld."

So here:

- K27N: position 27 lysine changing to arginine.

But wait, no—actually, "K" is lysine. So maybe it's a change from lysine (K) at position 27 to arginine (R)? But the mutation is denoted as N? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe in this context, K27N refers to the amino acid changing to N-terminal?

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here because without more context, it's unclear whether these are cDNA changes or protein level.

But looking at the example, they use "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", meaning that G is the reference in the coding strand and D is arginine. So perhaps each mutation can be represented as c.N[Position]X[Y], where X is ref, Y is alt, and then p.YY (protein change).

But since here we don't have the ref/alt, only the mutations K27N etc., I think it's better to note that in these cases, the exact bases are missing. So perhaps leave them as N/A.

Alternatively, maybe each mutation can be represented with the position and a generic "X" for ref/alt because we don't have the specific data.

But given the example provided by the user, they included both cDNA changes (transcript, ref, alt) and protein changes. So in our case, since the mutations are only described as single letter codes (K27N), perhaps it's better to assign N/A for transcript/alt and then write the mutation.

Wait, but K is lysine, so maybe changing from Lys to something else. But without knowing what, we can't specify ref or alt accurately.

So in this case, I think each variant will have:

- Gene: Parkin

- cDNA Change: position number (e.g., 27) with ref and alt as N/A because the specific bases are not provided.

Wait, but actually, in the example, "c.248G>A" is given, which implies that G to A is a change. So perhaps here, each mutation can be represented as:

For K27N: position 27 changing from K (lysine) to N (arginine).

Similarly for others.

But since the exact bases aren't provided, maybe it's better to represent them as:

c.27K>N

p.YY, where YY is the corresponding amino acid change.

Wait, but arginine is R in protein terms. So K27N would be lysine changing to arginine, which is K→R?

But that doesn't make sense because N is arginine. Maybe it's a different notation.

Alternatively, maybe "K" and "N" are codes for the amino acids involved, but without knowing the mapping, we can't determine. So perhaps in this case, since the example uses c.248G>A to indicate p.G83D, which is lysine (G) to arginine (D), maybe N corresponds to arginine.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to just list each mutation with their position and note that the exact changes are not provided in the abstract.

So for K27N: Gene is Parkin, cDNA change at 27 from ... to ..., but specific bases missing; protein change K→R or something.

But given the example, it's probably better to represent each mutation with their position and indicate that the exact bases are not provided. Alternatively, if we can't get them, perhaps just note N/A for transcript alt and ref as missing.

Wait, but in the context of single nucleotide mutations, they usually provide all four parts: position, reference, alternate, and the protein change (if any).

So given that, I think each mutation should be presented with their position, ref/alt, and protein change if possible.

But since only the positions are provided here, maybe we can infer some changes based on the context. For example:

- K27N: lysine at position 27 changes to arginine (since N is usually arginine).

Similarly:

R33Q: residue R33 changing to Q? Or perhaps from arginine (R) to glutamine (Q)?

Wait, maybe that's the case. So if we can map these letters to amino acids.

But I'm not entirely sure about all the mappings. However, in the example, c.248G>A corresponds to p.G83D, which is lysine to arginine.

So perhaps here:

- K27N: position 27 lysine → arginine (p.K27R)

Wait, no—because N represents arginine.

But I'm not sure if this mapping holds. Alternatively, maybe it's better to just note that the exact changes are unknown because they were only described as mutations without specifying which nucleotide is changing.

In any case, given the ambiguity and considering the example provided by the user, each mutation can be represented with their position in cDNA or protein terms, but since the abstract doesn't specify ref/alt for these mutations, perhaps it's better to note that data is missing. However, following the structure of the example, I'll list them as variants without exact changes.

So overall:

- Each variant has a position (e.g., K27N at position 27) with gene Parkin and N/A for cDNA change details because they're not specified in the abstract.
