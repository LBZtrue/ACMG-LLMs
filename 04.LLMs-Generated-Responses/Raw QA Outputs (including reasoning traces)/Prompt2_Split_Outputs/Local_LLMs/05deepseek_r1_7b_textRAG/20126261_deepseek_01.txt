Okay, so I need to figure out if the given paragraph talks about any mutations and extract that information using the JSON template provided. Let me read through the abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and Parkin causing parkinsonism and mitochondrial dysfunction. It also discusses how Parkin recognizes damaged mitochondria but doesn't explain it. They show that PINK1 expression on mitochondria is regulated by voltage-dependent proteolysis, keeping low levels on healthy mitochondria but allowing accumulation on damaged ones. This leads to Parkin recruitment and mitophagy.

Looking at the introduction part: It talks about recessive forms of familial Parkinson disease linked to mutations in Parkin or PINK1. These families have issues with mitochondrial dysfunction in the substantia nigra, a region of the brain affected by Parkinson's. There’s no known cure for the disease because of complex causes involving mitochondrial dysfunction.

So from this, I can identify that there are mutations mentioned: PINK1 and Parkin. But wait, they didn't specify any particular variant or change—just the gene names. The abstract doesn't provide specific mutation details like c.248G>A or p.G83D; it's more about the genes involved rather than specific mutations.

The JSON template requires information on gene names, variants (cDNA changes), protein changes, and descriptions in context. Since no specific mutations are mentioned beyond PINK1 and Parkin, I can only extract the gene names here.

So putting this together, I'll include "PINK1" and "Parkin" as the genes with empty variant information since there's nothing more detailed provided.
