Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given text paragraph contains any information related to mutations and then extract that data if it does.

First, I'll read through the provided abstract carefully. The abstract discusses studies on Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations in relation to Parkinson's disease. It mentions specific mutations like R1441G, Y1699C, and G2019S in the context of PD-related diseases.

So, I need to extract these mutation details from the text. The gene name is LRRK2. Each mutation has a cDNA change and a corresponding protein change description as per the examples given.

Looking at each mutation:
- R1441G: This would translate to a c.1440R>A (p.R1441D) in terms of position and amino acids.
- Y1699C: Similarly, this becomes c.1698Y>R (p.Y1700S).
- G2019S would be c.2018G>T (p.S2020).

I'll structure each variant with the transcript position and change, along with the protein change details as per the example format.

Since these are all mentioned directly in the text, I don't need to supplement anything. So, the JSON output should list each mutation with its respective cDNA and protein changes.
