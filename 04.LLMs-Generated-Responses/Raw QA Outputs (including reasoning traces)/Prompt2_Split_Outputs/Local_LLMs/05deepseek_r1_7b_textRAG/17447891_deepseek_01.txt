Okay, I need to determine if the provided paragraph contains any information related to mutations and extract it accordingly.

First, I'll read through the given text carefully. The abstract mentions that mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). It also talks about LRRK2 containing specific domains like leucine-rich repeats, GTPase domain, COR, kinase, and WD40 motifs.

Next, I notice sections discussing how LRRK2 is regulated. There are mentions of phosphorylation by an activated PD mutant of LRRK2 (G2019S), which leads to the phosphorylation of proteins like moesin at Thr 558. This suggests that there are mutations or changes in the activity related to specific amino acid positions.

I also see references to other mutations such as R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C, and T2356I affecting kinase activity. These look like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or point mutations in the LRRK2 gene.

Looking further down, there's a discussion about the catalytically active fragment of LRRK2 requiring certain domains like GTPase, COR, kinase domain, WD40 motif, and a C-terminal tail. This indicates that specific residues are involved in function but doesn't directly state any mutations unless they're part of the context.

In the section where they determined the effect of nine PD mutations on kinase activity, only G2019S stimulated kinase activity, while others inhibited it or had no effect. These are mutations at positions 2019 (G), 1441 (R replaced by C or G), 1699 (Y to C), and 2356 (T to I).

I should extract these mutation details accurately. Each variant has a position, a change from the reference (ref) to alternative (alt), which translates into amino acid changes.

For each mutation:
- cDNA Change: The transcript is N.D., but position can be extracted.
- Protein Change: The ref and alt are provided in parentheses after the cDNA change.
- Description: Each variant is a separate entry under the 'variants' array.

I need to structure this information into JSON, ensuring that only mutation-related details are included. All other parts not related to mutations will be marked as N.D.

So, compiling all this, I can create the JSON object with Gene: LRRK2 and the variants list containing each mutation found.
