Okay, so I need to analyze this given paragraph from a medical literature text and extract any information related to mutations. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the abstract mentions that mutations in the DJ-1 gene are associated with Parkinson's disease. It talks about specific point mutations like L166P and M26I. These are clearly mutation examples mentioned. Also, they discuss other variants such as R98Q which were generally stable but didn't cause issues.

The introduction part also mentions that DJ-1 is involved in interactions with the proto-oncogene c-myc and possibly has protease or chaperone activities. But I'm looking for specific mutation details here. The introduction doesn't provide any mutation examples beyond what's already mentioned in the abstract, so perhaps there are no additional mutations in this part.

So, based on this analysis, the paragraph does contain mutation information related to the DJ-1 gene with specific point mutations like L166P and M26I.
