Alright, I'm looking at this paragraph from a medical literature paper about Parkinson's disease and the LRRK2 gene mutations. The user wants me to extract specific mutation information related to this gene.

First, I'll read through the abstract to spot any mentions of LRRK2 variants or mutations associated with Parkinson's. The abstract talks about two polymorphic variants found in Chinese patients: rs34778348:G4A; p.G2385R and rs33949390:G4C; p.R1628P, both associated with PD among Han Chinese. It also mentions another mutation, G2019S, which was absent in the study population.

Next, I'll focus on the introduction to find more context about these mutations. The paragraph discusses LRRK2 as a causative gene for PD and mentions that various studies have shown its role explaining between 5-13% of familial cases and up to 5% of sporadic cases.

Looking deeper into the text, there's specific information about the variants p.G2385R and p.R1628P. The risk associated with these mutations is mentioned: an individual carrying both has a relative risk of approximately 1.9. If they also carry rs7133914:G4C; p.5-1.6, or rs7308720:C4A; p.N551K, the risk slightly decreases to around 1.5-1.6.

Additionally, there's a comparison of kinase activity for different variants: p.R1398H has significantly lower kinase activity compared to wild type, while p.G2385R and p.R1628P have higher kinase activity than the wild type.

Putting this information together, I can structure it into a JSON format that includes the gene name (LRRK2), its variants with their cDNA changes, protein changes, and the context-specific descriptions provided in the text. Since all the necessary details are directly mentioned, there's no need to supplement any parts with "N.D."

I'll make sure each variant is clearly listed under the "variants" key within an array, ensuring that both the cDNA change (transcript position) and protein change (amino acid substitution) are accurately captured along with their descriptions.

Finally, I'll format everything into a JSON structure as required by the user, making sure there's no missing information and each field is correctly labeled.
