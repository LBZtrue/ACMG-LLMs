Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically focusing on extracting mutation information from the provided abstract and introduction.

First, I'll read through the given text carefully. The abstract mentions DJ-1 mutations related to Parkinson's disease. The key mutations discussed are D149A and L166P. I need to identify these and their details. 

Looking at the D149A mutation: the text says it's an early-onset PD-associated mutation. The cDNA change would be c.446G>A (assuming the codon for D149 is GAA or GAG, but the exact position might not be specified here. Wait, the original text doesn't mention the exact cDNA position for D149A. The user's example includes the position, so maybe I need to check if the text provides that. Wait, the abstract says "D149A" which refers to the amino acid change at position 149. The cDNA change would be the corresponding nucleotide change. However, the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position, so I should note that as N.D. for the transcript and position. But the example shows that even if the position isn't given, they still include the description as "c.248G>A (p.G83D)".

Wait, in the user's example, the input text mentions "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" so they extract both the cDNA and protein changes. But in the given abstract, the mutations are described as "D149A" and "L166P". The text doesn't mention the exact cDNA positions, so for those, I should put N.D. for the transcript and position. However, the description in the input context would be "D149A" and "L166P".

Also, the text mentions that the D149A mutation makes DJ-1 resistant to caspase-6 proteolysis and abolishes its protective phenotype. The L166P mutation prevents dimerization but doesn't impair proteolysis. 

So for each mutation, I need to extract the gene (DJ-1), the cDNA change (if provided), the protein change, and the description. Since the cDNA positions aren't given in the text, those fields would be N.D. except the description which is the mutation name.

Wait, the user's example includes "cDNA Change" with transcript, ref, alt, position. But in the input text, the mutations are only described as D149A and L166P. So the cDNA change is not provided, so those fields would be N.D. But the protein change would be the amino acid change. However, the text doesn't mention the exact codon for these mutations. Wait, the D149A is a single amino acid change, so the protein change is p.D149A. Similarly, L166P is p.L166P. The cDNA change would be the corresponding nucleotide change, but since the text doesn't specify, it's N.D. 

So the JSON should have the gene as DJ-1, and for each variant, cDNA change with transcript N.D., ref and alt as N.D., position N.D., but the protein change would be p.D149A and p.L166P. The description in the input context would be the mutation names as given. 

Wait, the user's example includes the description as the full string like "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", but in the given text, the mutations are just D149A and L166P. So the description would be those strings. 

So putting it all together, the JSON would have "Gene": "DJ-1", and two variants. Each variant's cDNA change would be N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, position. The protein change would be p.D149A and p.L166P. The description in input context would be "D14,9A" and "L166P". Wait, the text says "D149A" and "L166P", so the description is those exact strings. 

Also, the introduction mentions that DJ-1 is implicated in 1-2% of recessive PD, but doesn't mention specific mutations there. The main mutations are in the abstract. 

So the final JSON should include the two mutations with their respective details. The rest of the fields not mentioned would be N.D. as per the constraints.
