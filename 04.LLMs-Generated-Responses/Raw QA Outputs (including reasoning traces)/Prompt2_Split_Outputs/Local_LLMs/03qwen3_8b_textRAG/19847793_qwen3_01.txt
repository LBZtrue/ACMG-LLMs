Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically to extract mutation information from the provided abstract and introduction.

First, I need to read through the given text carefully. The abstract mentions mutations in the PINK1 gene associated with Parkinson's disease. The study created cell lines with normal and mutant PINK1 to simulate heterozygous and homozygous states. They generated mutants in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain. The cell lines were tested under oxidative stress, and the results showed increased apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential changes in mutants.

Now, looking at the introduction part, the user hasn't provided the full text, but the abstract is the main content here. The task is to check for mutations and extract details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. 

The key points from the abstract are:
- Mutations in PINK1 are linked to Parkinson's.
- Mutants in N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain were created.
- These mutants were cloned into a vector to make stable cell lines.
- The study found that these mutants led to increased apoptosis and mitochondrial issues under oxidative stress.

But wait, the abstract doesn't specify exact cDNA or protein changes. It just mentions the regions (N-terminus, C-terminus, kinase domain) and the effect of the mutations. The example given by the user includes specific cDNA and protein changes, like c.248G>A (p.G83D). However, in the provided text, there are no such specific mutations listed. The text refers to mutants in certain domains but doesn't give exact nucleotide or amino acid changes.

So, according to the user's instructions, if the text doesn't mention specific mutations, I should use "N.D." for the cDNA and protein changes. The gene is PINK1, and the mutation descriptions are the regions mentioned. The description in the input context would be the general statement about the mutations in those regions affecting the cells.

Therefore, the extracted information should include the gene PINK1, the variants with cDNA and protein changes as N.D., and the description mentioning the regions (N-terminus, C-terminus, kinase domain) and their effects. The user's example shows that even if specific changes aren't present, the description in the input context should capture the general mutation info mentioned in the text.

I need to structure this into the JSON format as specified, making sure not to include any fabricated data. Since the text doesn't specify exact mutations beyond the regions, the cDNA and protein change fields should be "N.D.", but the description should note the regions and the effects observed. The user's example includes the description as the exact phrase from the text, so I'll follow that approach.

            "Description in input context": "Mutants in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain were generated. Cell lines expressing kinase and C-terminus mutants exhibited greater apoptosis and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) under oxidative stress. Two copies of kinase mutants showed greater apoptosis and ΔΨm decrease than one copy. Heterozygous/homozygous mutations exerted gene dosage effects, with decreased cell survival in mutant-expressing cell lines compared to wild-type."
