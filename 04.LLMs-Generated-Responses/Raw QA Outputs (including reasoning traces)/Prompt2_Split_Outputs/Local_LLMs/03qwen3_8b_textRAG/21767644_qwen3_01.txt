Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically focused on extracting mutation information from the provided text. First, I need to read through the abstract and introduction carefully.

Looking at the abstract, the first sentence mentions mutations in the N-terminus of the α-syn gene linked to autosomal dominant PD. The specific mutation mentioned is A30P. I should note that. Then, in the introduction, there's a reference to point mutations within the α-syn gene leading to familial PD, citing Krüger et al. and Polymeropoulos et al. However, the exact mutations from those studies aren't detailed in the provided text. 

The user's example shows how to structure the JSON with Gene, variants, cDNA Change, Protein Change, and Description. The key here is to extract only the mutations directly mentioned. The A30P mutation is a known mutation in α-syn, but I need to check if the text specifies it as a point mutation. The abstract says "mutations in the N-terminus" and later mentions "mutant A30P α-syn," which implies that A30P is a specific mutation. 

Wait, the abstract says "A30P α-syn" which is a point mutation where Alanine at position 30 is replaced by Proline. The introduction refers to "point mutations within the α-syn gene leading to familial PD," but the specific mutations from those studies aren't given here. So, in the provided text, the only mutation explicitly mentioned is A30P. 

I need to structure this into the JSON. The Gene is α-syn. For variants, the cDNA change would be c.97A>T (since position 30 in the protein corresponds to codon 97 in the cDNA, assuming the start is at 1). The protein change is p.A30P. The description in the context is "A30P α-syn" or "mutant A30P α-syn." 

Wait, the text says "mutant A30P α-syn," so the mutation is A30P. The original text doesn't specify the exact cDNA change, but since it's a point mutation, I can infer the cDNA position. However, the user's example includes the cDNA position, so maybe I should check if the text provides that. The abstract mentions the mutation in the N-terminus, but the exact cDNA position isn't stated. Wait, the user's example has c.248G>A, which is a specific position. In the given text, the mutation is A30P, which is a single amino acid change. To get the cDNA position, we need to know the exact location. However, the text doesn't specify the cDNA change, so maybe I should leave that as N.D. or infer based on standard knowledge. Wait, the user's instruction says to extract only what's directly mentioned. Since the text doesn't specify the cDNA position, I can't assume it. Therefore, the cDNA change might be N.D. But the example includes the cDNA change even if it's inferred. Hmm.

Wait, the user's example includes "c.248G>A" as the cDNA change. In the given text, the mutation is A30P. If the text doesn't mention the exact cDNA position, then according to the constraints, I should use N.D. for that. However, the user's example includes the cDNA change even if it's inferred. Wait, in the example, the input text says "c.24,8G>A (p.G83D)", so the cDNA change is provided. In the current text, the mutation is A30P, but the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position. Therefore, the cDNA change should be N.D. unless the text provides it. The user's instruction says to extract only information directly related to mutations. Since the text doesn't mention the cDNA position, I can't include it. So, the cDNA change would be N.D., and the protein change is p.A30P. The description in the context is "mutant A30P α-syn" or "A30P α-syn." 

Wait, the abstract says "mutant A30P α-syn," which is a protein change. The introduction mentions "point mutations within the α-syn gene leading to familial PD," but the specific mutations from those studies aren't detailed here. Therefore, the only mutation directly mentioned is A30P. 

So, the Gene is "SNCA" (the gene name for α-synuclein). The variants would have the cDNA change as N.D., protein change as p.A30P, and description as "mutant A30P α-syn". 

Wait, but the text says "A30P α-syn" which is a mutation in the protein. The cDNA change would be the codon change. Since the protein is A30P, that corresponds to a single amino acid change at position 30. The codon for Alanine at position 30 would be GCT, GCA, GCG, or GCC. Changing to Proline (Pro) would be CCA, CCG, CCC, or CCA. So the cDNA change would be something like c.97G>A (assuming the start codon is at 1, and position 30 is codon 97 if the protein is 129 amino acids long). However, the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position, so according to the user's constraints, I should use N.D. for cDNA change. Therefore, the JSON would have the Gene as SNCA, variants with cDNA change N.D., protein change p.A30P, and description as "mutant A30P α-syn". 

Wait, the user's example includes the cDNA change even if it's inferred. But in this case, the text doesn't mention the cDNA position, so I can't infer it. Therefore, the cDNA change should be N.D. 

So the final JSON would have Gene: "SNCA", variants with cDNA change N.D., protein change p.A30P, and description as "mutant A30P α-syn".
