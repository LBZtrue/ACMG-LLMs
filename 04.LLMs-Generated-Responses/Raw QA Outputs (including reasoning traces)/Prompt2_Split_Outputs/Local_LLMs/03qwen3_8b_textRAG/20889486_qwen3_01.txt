Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided abstract and introduction. 

First, I need to read through the given text carefully. The abstract mentions a Parkin RING domain mutant, C289G. That's a specific mutation. The gene here is PARK2, which encodes Parkin. The cDNA change would be c.289G>A, since the mutation is C289G. Wait, the mutation is written as C289G, which refers to the protein. To get the cDNA change, I need to consider that the codon for the specific amino acid change. But the abstract says "Parkin RING domain mutant (C289G)", so the protein change is from C to G at position 289. However, in the cDNA, the change would be from G to A if the original codon had a G at that position. Wait, maybe the cDNA change is c.289G>A leading to the protein change p.C289G. But the user's example shows that for c.248G>A, the protein is p.G83D. So, the cDNA change is written as c. followed by the position and the nucleotide change. 

In the abstract, they mention Parkin(C289G), which is the protein change. The gene is PARK2. The cDNA change would be c.289G>A, assuming that the original codon had a G at position 289, and the mutation changes it to A, leading to the amino acid change from C (which is codon for C) to G. Wait, but the protein change is C289G. So the original amino acid is C (cysteine), and the mutation changes it to G (glycine). So the cDNA change would be a substitution at position 289. Let me check the example again. In the example, c.248G>A leads to p.G83D. So the cDNA position is 248, and the protein position is 83. So the cDNA change is c.289G>A would correspond to p.C289G. 

Then, the introduction mentions mutations in PARK2 associated with familial Parkinson's disease. The example given in the introduction is mutations in PARK2, the gene encoding Parkin. So the gene is PARK2, and the mutation is C289G. 

Wait, but in the abstract, the mutation is described as Parkin RING domain mutant (C28,9G). The user's example uses c. and p. notation. So in the extracted information, the gene is PARK2, the variants would include the cDNA change and protein change. The cDNA change is c.289G>A, leading to p.C289G. The description in the input context is "Parkin RING domain mutant (C289G)". 

Additionally, in the introduction, it mentions that mutations in PARK2 were linked to autosomal recessive juvenile onset Parkinsonism. But the specific mutation isn't mentioned there. The example in the introduction is about the gene PARK2, but the specific mutation is only in the abstract. 

So, the extracted information should include the gene PARK2, the variant with cDNA change c.289G>A and protein change p.C289G, and the description from the input context. The other parts of the introduction don't mention specific mutations beyond the gene PARK2 being associated with familial cases. 

I need to make sure that the JSON structure is correct, with Gene, variants array, each variant having cDNA Change, Protein Change, and Description. The other fields like transcript in cDNA Change should be N.D. since the transcript isn't specified. 

So the final answer should have Gene: PARK2, variants with the cDNA change and protein change as described, and the description from the input. The introduction mentions PARK2 mutations but doesn't specify the exact mutation, so only the abstract's mutation is included.
