Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically to extract mutation-related information from the provided abstract and introduction.

First, I'll read through the given text carefully. The abstract mentions "autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism, which is one of the most common familial forms of the disease, is directly linked to mutations in the parkin gene." So here, the gene is parkin, and the mutation is associated with this specific form of Parkinson's. However, the abstract doesn't specify the exact type of mutation, like cDNA or protein changes. It just says mutations in the parkin gene are linked to the disease.

Looking further, the introduction talks about the ubiquitination process and E3 ligases but doesn't mention specific mutations. The key part is in the abstract where they discuss pathogenic Parkin mutations disrupting autoinhibition. The term "pathogenic" implies that these mutations are disease-causing, but again, there's no detailed description of the mutations themselves, such as specific nucleotide changes or amino acid substitutions.

The user's examples show that if specific details like cDNA changes or protein changes aren't present, they should be marked as "N.D." In this case, the literature only mentions the gene (parkin) and the fact that mutations are linked to the disease, but no specific variants. Therefore, the extracted information should include the gene name and note that mutations are involved, but leave the variants, cDNA, protein changes, and descriptions as N.D. since they aren't specified in the text.

I need to make sure I don't add any information that's not explicitly stated. The answer should strictly follow the JSON format, with "Gene" as "parkin" and the rest of the fields set to "N.D." because the specific mutation details aren't provided in the input text.
