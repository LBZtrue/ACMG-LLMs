Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as an expert in extracting mutation information from medical literature. The input is an abstract and introduction from a study about LRRK2 mutations and Parkinson's disease.

First, I need to scan through the provided text to find any mentions of mutations. The abstract starts by talking about LRRK2 mutations being the most common genetic cause of parkinsonism. It specifically mentions the G2019S variant as the most common, but in Asia, G2385R is more frequent. Then they discuss generating transgenic Drosophila with various LRRK2 alleles, including wild type, G2019S, Y1699C, and G2385R. The results show that the variants G2019S, Y1699C, and G2385R cause late-onset DA neuron loss, while wild-type doesn't. They also mention reduced lifespan and sensitivity to rotenone. Coexpression of parkin protects against neurodegeneration in G2019S flies.

In the introduction, PD is linked to mutations in genes like LRRK2. The text states that LRRK2 mutations are the most common genetic cause of parkinsonism and lists several mutations identified.

Now, I need to extract the relevant details. The genes mentioned are LRRK2. The variants are G2019S, Y1699C, G2385R. For each variant, I should note the cDNA and protein changes. 

For G2019S: The cDNA change is likely c.2019G>A, leading to p.G2019S. The abstract mentions G2019S as the variant, so I need to check if the exact cDNA position is given. The text says "G2019S variant" but doesn't specify the exact cDNA position. Wait, in the abstract, the variants are listed as G2019S, Y1699C, and G2385R. The user's example includes cDNA and protein changes. Since the text doesn't explicitly state the cDNA positions for these variants, maybe they are standard. For example, G2019S is a known mutation in LRRK2, typically c.2019G>A. Similarly, Y1699C would be c.1699C>A, leading to p.Y1699C. G2385R is c.2385G>A, p.G2385R. However, the original text doesn't mention the exact cDNA positions, so I should check if they are provided. 

Wait, the abstract says "G2019S variant" but the user's example includes cDNA and protein. Since the original text doesn't specify the cDNA positions, maybe they are not provided. However, in the example, the user included the cDNA change as "c.248G>A" even though the original text might not have specified. Wait, looking back at the example, the input text was "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", and the extracted info included that. So if the original text mentions the variant as G2019S, but doesn't specify the exact cDNA, maybe the user expects us to extract the variant name as the protein change, but the cDNA might be missing. However, the user's example includes both cDNA and protein changes. 

Wait, in the problem statement, the user's example includes the cDNA change and protein change. So in the current case, the abstract mentions the variants as G2019S, Y1699C, G2385R. These are protein changes. To get the cDNA changes, I need to infer. For example, G2019S would correspond to a cDNA change where the codon at position 2019 is changed from G to A (since G is the reference, and S is the amino acid, which is serine). But the exact cDNA position might be different. However, since the original text doesn't specify, perhaps the cDNA change is not provided. But the user's example includes cDNA changes even if they are not explicitly mentioned. Wait, in the example, the input text had the cDNA change, so the user's example is based on that. 

But in the current case, the input text doesn't mention the exact cDNA positions. The abstract says "G2019S variant" but doesn't specify the cDNA. So according to the user's constraints, I should extract only what's directly mentioned. If the text doesn't mention the cDNA, then "N.D." for cDNA. However, in the example, the user included the cDNA even if the input text didn't have it. Wait, no. The example input text did have the cDNA change. Let me check again. The example input was: "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression." So the input text includes the cDNA change. The extracted info includes that. So in our case, the input text mentions the variants as G2019S, Y1699C, G2385R. Are these the protein changes? Yes. So the protein changes are G2019S, Y1699C, G2385R. The cDNA changes would be the corresponding codon positions. But since the input text doesn't mention the cDNA positions, perhaps they are not provided. However, the user's example includes the cDNA change. Wait, the example input has the cDNA change, so the extracted info includes that. So if the input text doesn't mention the cDNA change, then we should put N.D. for cDNA. 

Wait, the user's instruction says: "extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions." So if the input text doesn't mention the cDNA changes, then the cDNA change field should be N.D. But in the example, the input text did mention the cDNA, so the extracted info includes that. Therefore, in our case, the input text mentions the variants as protein changes (G2019S, etc.), but doesn't mention the exact cDNA positions. So the cDNA change would be N.D. unless the text provides it. 

Wait, the abstract says "G2019S variant" but doesn't specify the exact cDNA. However, in the medical literature, G2019S is a known mutation in LRRK2, which is c.2019G>A (p.G2019S). But the original text doesn't mention this. The user's instruction says to extract only what is explicitly stated. Therefore, the cDNA change would be N.D. unless the text provides it. 

So, for each variant, the protein change is given (G2019S, Y1699C, G2385R), but the cDNA change is not mentioned. Therefore, in the JSON, the cDNA change would be N.D. for each variant. However, the user's example includes the cDNA change even though the input text had it. So in our case, since the text doesn't mention the cDNA, we should leave it as N.D. 

Wait, but the user's example includes the cDNA change as part of the description. So in the example, the input text has the cDNA and the protein change. So in our case, the input text mentions the protein changes but not the cDNA. Therefore, the cDNA change is N.D. 

So, the extracted information would be:

Gene: LRRK2
Variants: 
- cDNA Change: N.D.
- Protein Change: G2019S
- Description: G2019S variant
Similarly for Y1699C and G2385R.

Wait, but the user's example includes the cDNA change as part of the variant description. So if the text mentions "G2019S variant", the description would be "G2019S variant", and the protein change is G2019S. The cDNA change is N.D. because it's not mentioned. 

So the JSON would look like:

{
    "Gene": "LRRK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "S",
                "position": "2019"
            },
            "Description in input context": "G2019S variant"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "Y",
                "alt": "C",
                "position": "1699"
            },
            "Description in input context": "Y1699C"
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "G",
                "alt": "R",
                "position": "2385"
            },
            "Description in input context": "G2385R"
        }
    ]
}

But wait, the abstract mentions "G2019S variant" and others. The user's example includes the cDNA change as part of the description. However, in our case, the text doesn't mention the exact cDNA positions, so the cDNA change fields are N.D. 

But maybe the user expects that the cDNA change is inferred from the protein change. For example, if the variant is G2019S, the cDNA change would be c.2019G>A. However, the user's instruction says to extract only what's explicitly stated. Therefore, unless the text provides the cDNA, we can't assume. 

Therefore, the correct approach is to list the protein changes and note that the cDNA changes are not mentioned. However, the user's example shows that if the input text includes the cDNA, it's extracted. So in our case, since the input text doesn't mention the cDNA, the cDNA change is N.D. 

Thus, the JSON would have the Protein Change with the ref and alt, and the cDNA change as N.D. Also, the "Description in input context" would be the variant name as given. 

Another thing to check: the introduction mentions "LRRK2 mutations are currently recognized as the most common genetic cause of parkinsonism." So the gene is LRRK2. The variants are G2019S, Y1699C, G2385R. 

So the final JSON should include all these variants with their respective protein changes and N.D. for cDNA changes.
