Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically focusing on extracting mutation information from the provided abstract. 

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main topic is Parkinson's disease (PD) and mitochondrial dysfunction, with mentions of PINK1 and Parkin genes. The question is about identifying mutations related to these genes.

Looking at the text, there are several mentions of mutations. For example, it says "PD-associated genes, PINK1 and Parkin" and later refers to "disease-associated piNK1 mutations." Also, there's a part about "PD-linked piNK1 mutations" and how they affect binding to Parkin. 

I need to check for specific mutation details. The abstract mentions "disease-associated piNK1 mutations" and "PD-linked piNK1 mutations," but it doesn't specify the exact cDNA or protein changes. However, there's a part that says "PD-associated parkin mutations interfere with the process of mitophagy at distinct steps." But again, no specific mutations are listed here. 

Wait, the user's example includes cDNA and protein changes, but the abstract here doesn't provide those details. The text refers to mutations in PINK1 and Parkin but doesn't give specific variants like c.248G>A. So, in this case, the abstract mentions the existence of mutations in these genes but doesn't specify the exact mutations. 

Therefore, according to the constraints, if the text doesn't mention specific cDNA or protein changes, I should use "N.D." for those fields. The gene names are PINK1 and Parkin, and the descriptions mention that mutations in these genes are associated with PD and affect mitophagy. 

So, the extracted information should include the genes, and under variants, since there are no specific cDNA or protein changes, those fields will be N.D. But the description in the input context should note that the mutations are disease-associated and affect Parkin's function. 

Wait, the example shows that even if the text mentions a mutation without specifics, like "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", it's included. But in this case, the abstract doesn't have such specifics. So, for each variant, the cDNA and protein changes are N.D., but the description in the input context would be the general statement about the mutations. 

However, the user's example includes a specific variant. Since the abstract here doesn't mention any specific variants, I should note that under the "variants" array, each entry would have "cDNA Change" and "Protein Change" as N.D., but the "Description in input context" would be the general mention of the mutations. 

But the user's example has a single variant. Here, the abstract mentions mutations in PINK1 and Parkin, but perhaps each gene has its own variants. However, the text doesn't specify any particular variants, so each gene's variants would have N.D. for cDNA and protein changes. 

Wait, the text says "disease-associated piNK1 mutations" and "PD-associated parkin mutations." So, for PINK1, the mutations are disease-associated, and for Parkin, the mutations interfere with mitophagy. But no specific variants are given. 

So, in the JSON, the "Gene" would be PINK1 and Parkin. Each gene would have a variant with N.D. in cDNA and protein changes, and the description would be the respective mentions. 

But the user's example has one gene with one variant. Here, there are two genes, each with their own mutations. So, the JSON should have two entries under "variants" for each gene. 

So, the final answer would list both genes, each with their own variants, where cDNA and protein changes are N.D., but the description in the input context is the relevant part from the text.
