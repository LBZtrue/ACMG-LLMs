Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically to extract mutation information from the provided text. The input is two paragraphs discussing PARK2 gene mutations in both Parkinson's disease and cancer.

First, I need to read through the abstract and the main Parkinson's disease paragraph carefully. The goal is to identify any mentions of mutations, gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. 

Starting with the abstract: It mentions PARK2 mutations in cancer, both somatic mutations and intragenic deletions. It also states that these mutations occur in the same domains and sometimes the same residues as germline mutations causing Parkinson's. The mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects and reduce E3 ligase activity, affecting ubiquitination of cyclin E leading to mitotic instability. 

In the main paragraph about Parkinson's, it talks about germline mutations in PARK2 causing early-onset PD, leading to loss of dopaminergic neurons. It also mentions PARK2's role in ubiquitination with UBCH7 and UBCH8, and its substrates like cyclin E, which is important for preventing excitotoxicity. However, the main paragraph doesn't mention specific mutations beyond the germline ones causing PD. 

So, the first part of the answer should focus on the mutations in cancer. The abstract mentions "inactivating somatic mutations" and "intragenic deletions" of PARK2. The exact cDNA or protein changes aren't specified, so those fields would be "N.D." But the description in the context would note the types of mutations. Also, it mentions that mutations in cancer occur in the same domains and residues as germline mutations causing PD. 

For the Parkinson's section, the germline mutations are mentioned, but without specific cDNA or protein changes. The example given in the user's prompt includes a specific mutation (c.248G>A), but in this case, the text doesn't specify exact positions, so those would be "N.D." However, the description would note that germline mutations in PARK2 cause PD, leading to early-onset loss of neurons. 

I need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. Each gene (PARK2) will have variants. For the cancer-related mutations, the variants would include the types of mutations (somatic, intragenic deletions), and the description mentions the domains and residues overlapping with PD mutations. The Parkinson's part would have the germline mutations, but without specific cDNA or protein changes, so those fields are N.D. 

Wait, the user's example includes "cDNA Change" and "Protein Change" with "N.D." if not mentioned. So, in the cancer section, since the text doesn't specify exact cDNA or protein changes, those fields would be N.D., but the description in the context would note the types of mutations (somatic, intragenic deletions) and their effects. 

Similarly, the Parkinson's section mentions germline mutations causing PD, but again, no specific cDNA or protein changes are given. So those would be N.D., but the description would state that germline mutations in PARK2 are the cause. 

I need to make sure that all fields are filled according to the JSON structure. Let me check each part again. The abstract mentions "inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic deletions of PARK2 in human malignancies." So, for the variants in cancer, the cDNA and protein changes are N.D., but the description includes those mutation types. Also, the part about mutations in cancer occurring in the same domains and residues as PD mutations would be part of the description. 

In the main paragraph, the germline mutations are mentioned as causing PD, but again, no specific changes. So, the variants under PARK2 would include the germline mutations, but without cDNA or protein details. 

Putting it all together, the JSON should have two entries for PARK2, one for cancer-related mutations and one for germline mutations in PD. Each variant would have the respective descriptions. Let me structure that accordingly.
