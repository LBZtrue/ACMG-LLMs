Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically to extract mutation information from the provided text.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction carefully. The abstract mentions mutations like E46K, A30P, and A53T in the α-synuclein gene. These are all specific mutations. The introduction also talks about these mutations causing autosomal dominant LBD. 

Looking at the abstract, the mutations are listed as E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A5, which is a combination. The wild type is mentioned as WT. The study uses various methods to examine the aggregation processes of these mutations. 

I need to extract the gene name, which is α-synuclein. The cDNA changes are the specific mutations. For each mutation, I'll note the cDNA change and the protein change. For example, E46K would have cDNA change at position 46, with G to A? Wait, no. Wait, the mutation is E46K, which is a substitution of glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K) at position 46. But in terms of cDNA, the exact change might be different. Wait, the user's example shows that for c.248G>A, the protein change is p.G83D. So the cDNA position is 248, with ref G and alt A. Then the protein position is 83, with ref G and alt D. 

But in the given text, the mutations are E46K, A30P, A53T. Let me think. For E46K, the amino acid change is E to K at position 46. The cDNA change would be the codon that codes for E at position 46 being changed to the codon for K. However, the exact cDNA position might not be specified here. Wait, the text says "mutations such as E46K, A30P and A53T in the αS gene". The example in the user's prompt uses cDNA positions, but here the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position. So in this case, the user's example includes the cDNA position, but the input text here might not. Wait, the input text in the question is the abstract and introduction provided. Let me check again.

The abstract says: "Mutations such as E46K, A30P and A53T in the αS gene cause autosomal dominant LBD in a number of kindreds." So the mutations are E46K, A30P, A53T. The text doesn't mention cDNA positions or specific nucleotide changes, only the amino acid substitutions. 

In the example provided by the user, the cDNA change includes the position, ref, alt, etc. However, in the current input text, the mutations are described as amino acid changes (E46K, etc.), not as cDNA changes. Therefore, the cDNA change might not be specified here. But the user's example shows that even if the cDNA is not mentioned, they can still extract the protein change. Wait, in the example, the input text mentions c.248G>A (p.G83D). So the user's example includes both cDNA and protein changes. 

In the current input text, the mutations are described as E46K, A30P, A53T. These are amino acid substitutions. Therefore, the protein change would be E46K, A30P, A53T. However, the cDNA change isn't provided here. The text doesn't mention the exact nucleotide positions. Therefore, for the cDNA change, the user's example includes "transcript": "N.D.", but in the input text, since the cDNA position isn't given, we should set "transcript": "N.D.", and similarly for ref and alt. 

But the user's example shows that if the cDNA change is not mentioned, they still include the protein change. So for each mutation, the protein change is present. The cDNA change would be "N.D." because the text doesn't specify. 

So, the gene is α-synuclein. The variants are E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T. Wait, the text mentions "A30P/A53T mutations" as well. So that's a combination mutation. 

Therefore, the JSON should include all these mutations. For each variant, the cDNA change would be "N.D." because the text doesn't specify the exact nucleotide positions, only the amino acid changes. The protein change would be the amino acid substitution. 

So the extracted information would have the gene as α-synuclein, and variants with the respective protein changes. The description in input context would be the mutation names as given. 

I need to make sure that the JSON structure matches the example. For each variant, the cDNA Change has transcript, ref, alt, position. But since these are not provided, they are set to N.D. The protein change would have ref and alt, and position. 

Wait, the example shows that for c.248G>A, the protein change is p.G83D. So the position in the protein is 83, which corresponds to the cDNA position 248. But in our case, the text doesn't mention the cDNA position, so we can't assign that. Therefore, for the cDNA Change, all fields would be N.D., and the protein change would have the amino acid substitution. 

So the final JSON would have the gene as "α-synuclein", variants array with each mutation's details. For each variant, cDNA Change is N.D., and the protein change is the amino acid substitution. The description in input context would be the mutation name as given. 

Also, the A30P/A53T is a compound mutation, so it's included as a separate variant. 

So the answer should be structured accordingly.
