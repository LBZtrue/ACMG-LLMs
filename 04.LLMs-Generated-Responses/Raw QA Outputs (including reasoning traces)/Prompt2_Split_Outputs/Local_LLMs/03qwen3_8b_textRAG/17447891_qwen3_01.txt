Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically focused on extracting mutation information from the provided abstract. The goal is to determine if the text contains mutation-related details and extract them in a structured JSON format. If not, return "N.D.".

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. The main topic is about LRRK2 gene mutations causing Parkinson's disease. The abstract mentions several mutations, so I need to identify each one.

Looking at the first part, it states that mutations in LRRK2 cause late-onset PD. Then, the study used a KESTREL screen to identify proteins phosphorylated by the G2019S mutant. The G2019S mutation is a known PD-associated mutation. 

Next, the text discusses nine previously reported PD mutations of LRRK2. It specifies that G2019S stimulated kinase activity, while four others (R1941H, I2012T, I2020T, G2385R) inhibited activity. The remaining four (R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C, T2356I) didn't affect activity. 

I need to extract each mutation's details. For each mutation, I'll check the gene name, cDNA change, protein change, and description. The abstract doesn't mention specific transcripts, so "transcript" will be "N.D." for all. 

Let me list each mutation:

1. G2019S: The abstract mentions this as an activated mutant. The description includes that it's a PD mutation. The cDNA change is likely c.2019G>A, but the abstract doesn't specify the exact cDNA position, so I need to check. Wait, the abstract says "G2019S" which is a protein change. The cDNA change would be c.2019G>A since G to A would result in S (Serine) at position 2019. But the abstract might not explicitly state the cDNA position. Wait, the original text says "G2019S" as a mutation, which is a protein change. The abstract might not have the exact cDNA position, so I have to infer based on standard notation. However, the user's example includes both cDNA and protein changes. Since the abstract doesn't specify the exact cDNA position, maybe it's not provided. Wait, looking back, the abstract does mention "G2019S" as the mutation. The example in the user's prompt shows that the cDNA change is given as c.248G>A. So in the abstract, the mutation is described as "G2019S", which is a protein change. Therefore, the cDNA change would be c.2019G>A, but the abstract might not specify the exact position. Wait, the abstract says "G2019S" which is a protein change (G to S at position 2019). The cDNA change would be c.2019G>A. However, the abstract might not explicitly state the cDNA position. Wait, the text says "G2019S" is the mutation. But the example in the user's query shows that the cDNA change is given as c.248G>A. So in this case, the abstract doesn't mention the exact cDNA position for the mutations, only the protein change. Wait, the original text says "G2019S" is a mutation. However, the example in the user's prompt includes both cDNA and protein changes. The user's example input had "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", so the cDNA change is specified. 

But in the abstract provided, the mutations are listed as G2019S, R1941H, I2012T, I2020T, G2385R, R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C, T2356I. These are all protein changes. The abstract doesn't mention the exact cDNA positions, so for each mutation, the cDNA change would be inferred based on the protein position. For example, G2019S would be c.2019G>A (assuming the codon for G at position 2019 is G, so changing to A would result in S). However, the abstract might not specify the exact cDNA position, so perhaps the cDNA change is not provided. Wait, the user's example includes the cDNA change as "c.248G>A", which is the exact position. In the given abstract, the mutations are described as G2019S, etc., but the cDNA positions are not explicitly stated. Therefore, the cDNA change would be "N.D." unless the abstract provides it. But the abstract does mention "G2019S" as a mutation, which is a protein change. So for the cDNA change, since the abstract doesn't specify the exact position, perhaps it's not provided. Wait, the example in the user's prompt includes both cDNA and protein changes. In the given abstract, the mutations are listed without cDNA positions, only the protein changes. Therefore, the cDNA change would be "N.D." unless the abstract provides more details. However, the user's example shows that even if the cDNA position isn't specified, the cDNA change is given. Wait, the example input says "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" which includes both. So in the abstract, if the mutation is described as "G2019S", then the cDNA change would be c.2019G>A. But the abstract doesn't state this explicitly. Therefore, the cDNA change is not provided, so it should be "N.D."?

Wait, the user's instructions say to extract "cDNA Change" and "Protein Change". The abstract mentions the mutations as G2019S, which is a protein change. The cDNA change would be inferred based on the position. For example, the protein position 2019 corresponds to a specific codon. However, without knowing the exact codon, it's impossible to determine the exact cDNA change. Therefore, the cDNA change is "N.D." unless the abstract provides it. Since the abstract doesn't specify the exact cDNA positions, all cDNA changes would be "N.D.".

Wait, but the user's example has the cDNA change as "c.248G>A" and the protein change as "p.G83D". So in the abstract, the mutations are described as protein changes (e.g., G2019S), but the cDNA change is not explicitly stated. Therefore, for each mutation, the cDNA change is "N.D.", and the protein change is the given amino acid change. 

So for each mutation listed in the abstract, the cDNA change is "N.D.", the protein change is the amino acid substitution, and the description in the input context is the mutation name (e.g., G2019S). 

Therefore, the extracted information would include each mutation with the gene name LRRK2, cDNA change N.D., protein change as the amino acid substitution, and the description as the mutation name. 

Now, let's structure this into the JSON format as per the example. Each variant should have "cDNA Change" with "transcript", "ref", "alt", "position", and "Protein Change" with "ref", "alt", "position". However, since the abstract doesn't specify the exact cDNA positions, the "position" in cDNA change would be "N.D." and the "transcript" would also be "N.D.".

Wait, the example shows that the cDNA change includes the transcript (N.D.), ref, alt, position. So for each mutation, the cDNA change is N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, and position. Similarly, the protein change has ref and alt as the amino acids, and position as the position number. 

So for the mutation G2019S, the protein change would be ref: G, alt: S, position: 2019. The cDNA change would be transcript: N.D., ref: N.D., alt: N.D., position: N.D. 

But the user's example includes the cDNA change as "c.248G>A", so the position is 248. In the given abstract, the mutations are listed as G2019S, etc., but the cDNA positions are not provided. Therefore, the cDNA change for each mutation would be "N.D." in all fields except the description, which is the mutation name. 

So the JSON would have the gene as LRRK2, and each variant would have the cDNA change with N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, position, and the protein change with ref, alt, and position. 

Let me check the abstract again. The text mentions "nine previously reported PD mutations of LRRK2" and lists them: G2019S, R1941H, I2012T, I2020T, G2385R, R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C, T2356I. These are all protein changes. The abstract does not mention the exact cDNA positions, so the cDNA change fields would be N.D. 

Therefore, the extracted information would include all these mutations with their respective protein changes and the description as the mutation name. 

So the final JSON would have the gene as LRRK2, and each variant with cDNA change N.D. and protein change as the amino acid substitution with the position. 

I need to make sure that all mutations are included, even if some details are missing. The user's constraints say to use "N.D." for content not mentioned. So in this case, since the cDNA positions are not provided in the abstract, they are marked as N.D. 

Thus, the answer should be a JSON with the gene LRRK2 and the variants listed with their respective details.
