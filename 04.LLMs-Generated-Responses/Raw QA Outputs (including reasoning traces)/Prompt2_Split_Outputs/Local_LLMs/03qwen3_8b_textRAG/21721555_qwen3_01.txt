Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically to extract mutation information from the provided abstract. 

First, I need to read the abstract carefully. The main topic is about the differences in α-synuclein aggregation between human and mouse, and how mutations like A53T and S87N affect this. 

The user's instructions are clear: if there's mutation info, extract gene, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. If not, return "N.D." in the required JSON format. 

Looking at the abstract, the key mutations mentioned are A53T and S87N. The gene here is α-synuclein, which is typically referred to as SNCA in the literature. The A53T mutation is a single amino acid change from Alanine to Threonine at position 53. The S87N is another substitution, Serine to Asparagine at position 87. 

I need to check if the abstract specifies cDNA changes. The abstract mentions the amino acid substitutions but doesn't provide the exact cDNA positions. However, in the context of α-synuclein, the positions are usually referenced in the protein sequence. But sometimes, the cDNA position might be different. Wait, the abstract says "A53T substitution" which refers to the amino acid position. The cDNA change would be the corresponding nucleotide position. However, the abstract doesn't mention the cDNA position. So for the cDNA Change, the transcript is N.D., since it's not specified. 

The protein change is straightforward: A53T and S87N. The description in the input context would be the exact terms used, like "A53T substitution" and "S87N substitutions". 

The user's example shows that if the cDNA position isn't mentioned, it's set to N.D. So in this case, the cDNA Change's transcript, ref, alt, and position are all N.D., except the protein change. 

Wait, the abstract mentions "A53T substitution" which is the protein change. The cDNA change would be the corresponding nucleotide change. However, the abstract doesn't specify the exact cDNA position, so we can't include that. Therefore, for the cDNA Change, all fields are N.D. 

The Gene field should be SNCA, as that's the gene name for α-synuclein. 

So the JSON structure would have Gene: SNCA, and under variants, two entries for A53T and S87N. Each variant's cDNA Change is N.D., and the Protein Change has the respective amino acids and positions. The Description in input context would be the exact phrases from the abstract. 

I need to make sure there are no other mutations mentioned. The abstract only talks about A53T and S87N. The rest of the text discusses the effects of these mutations but doesn't mention other mutations. 

So the final JSON should include Gene: SNCA, two variants with their respective protein changes and descriptions. The cDNA changes are all N.D. since they aren't specified in the text. 

I should also check if the user's example uses "p." notation for protein changes. In the example, it's p.G83D. Here, the mutations are A53T and S87N, so the protein changes would be p.A53T and p.S87N. But the abstract doesn't use the "p." notation, so maybe just the amino acid and position. However, the example uses "p." so perhaps it's better to follow that format. Wait, the example's "Description in input context" is "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", so the format is cDNA change followed by the protein change in parentheses. 

In the abstract, the mutations are described as "A53T substitution" and "S87N substitutions". So the Description in input context would be those exact phrases. 

Therefore, the JSON should have variants with cDNA Change as N.D. and Protein Change as the respective amino acids and positions. The Description in input context is the exact terms from the abstract. 

I think that's all. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.
