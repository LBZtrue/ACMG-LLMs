Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically extracting mutation information from the provided abstract and introduction.

First, I'll start by reading through the given text carefully. The context mentions several mutations related to Parkinson's disease, particularly focusing on LRRK2 gene mutations. The key mutations discussed are I2020T and G2019S. 

Looking at the abstract, it states that these mutations are associated with late-onset autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. The mutations are in the LRRK2 gene, which encodes a kinase. The text explains that these mutations affect ATP affinity and kinase activity. For example, G2019S has lower ATP affinity compared to wild-type, while I2020T has higher ATP affinity. The kinase activity assays show different sensitivities to inhibitors based on these mutations.

In the introduction, it's mentioned that G2019S is the most common genetic cause of PD, both familial and non-familial. The I2020T mutation is noted to have lower kinase activity in substrate phosphorylation assays but variable results in autophosphorylation assays. The text also refers to previous studies showing altered ATP K m,app for G2019S.

Now, I need to extract the relevant details into the specified JSON format. The gene is clearly LRRK2. For each variant, I need to note the cDNA change, protein change, and any descriptions from the text. 

For G2019S: The cDNA change would be at position 2019, with G to S (since the protein change is G2019S). The description mentions it's the most common known genetic cause of PD, associated with both familial and non-familial cases. Also, it has higher kinase activity and altered ATP K m,app.

For I2020T: The cDNA change is at position 2020, T to I (since the protein change is I2020T). The description includes that it's a PD-associated mutant with lower kinase activity in some assays but higher in others. Also, it's more resistant to ATP-competitive inhibitors at 1 mM ATP.

I should check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The text mentions other mutations in the LRRK2 gene scattered across the protein, but the specific ones discussed are G2019S and I2020T. The other mutations are not detailed, so their cDNA and protein changes are N.D. unless specified. Since the user's example includes "N.D." for unspecified details, I should use that for any other mutations not detailed here.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the gene as LRRK2, with two variants. Each variant includes cDNA and protein changes, and their descriptions from the text. The other mutations are mentioned but without specific details, so they are marked as N.D. except for the two main ones. Also, ensure that all required fields are present and that the format matches the example provided.
