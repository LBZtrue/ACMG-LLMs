Alright, let's break down the problem here. The user has provided a paragraph from medical literature and wants to extract mutation information related to PINK1. My task is to carefully analyze this paragraph and determine if it contains any relevant mutations.

First, I'll read through the provided abstract to understand the context. It mentions that mutations in PINK1 cause recessive familial PD. The gene PINK1 has eight exons and encodes a 581 amino acid protein with specific structural domains. It also explains how some PD-related mutations affect this protein.

Now, I'll look for any terms related to mutations. I notice the phrase "mutations in PINK1" which directly refers to genetic changes within this gene. There's also mention of specific amino acid changes like "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", but these are not mutations but specific changes in the protein sequence, typically referred to as codon changes or point mutations.

The paragraph doesn't mention any actual mutations but rather discusses the genetic encoding and structural implications of PINK1's mutations affecting PD. There's no explicit mutation description like SNP codes (like SNCA) mentioned here, only one gene that is part of PINK1-related mutations.

Since the goal is to extract mutation information, I'll check if there are any mutations directly described or implied in the text. In this case, while the paragraph discusses genetic changes within PINK1 and their effects on PD, it doesn't provide specific mutation codes or annotations as seen in databases like Genbank or the NCBI's Mutation Bank.

Therefore, after analyzing the provided text, I conclude that there isn't explicit mutation information extracted. The literature does not mention any mutations directly related to PINK1 except for a single gene involved in its coding, which isn't labeled as a mutation code but rather as a gene causing disorder.

So, applying the user's instructions, since no relevant mutation details are found in the text, I should return "N.D." indicating that mutation information is not extracted.
