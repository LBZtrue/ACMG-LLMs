Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'm supposed to analyze a paragraph from medical literature about mutations and extract relevant information. The user provided a specific example where they extracted details related to cDNA changes in the TP53 gene. Now, my task is to go through another paragraph from the same context and do the same.

First, I need to carefully read the provided abstract to understand the main topic. It talks about alpha-synuclein, which is a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). The study focuses on how endogenous brain cytosolic factors regulate alpha-syn solubility and its role in neuronal membrane interactions, particularly in PD-related mutations.

The background section mentions that alpha-syn has three missense mutations: A30P, A53T, and E46K. These are associated with autosomal dominant familial forms of PD. The mutations cause defects in Lewy bodies accumulation in neurons and impaired brain cytosolic factors' effects on alpha-syn binding.

Now, the task is to extract mutation information from this paragraph. I need to identify which mutations (A30P, A53T, E46K) are mentioned and see how they're described. Let's go through each mutation one by one.

1. **A30P Mutation**:
   - The paragraph mentions that this is a missense mutation in alpha-syn gene involved in PD.
   - It states that these mutations cause defects in Lewy body accumulation.
   - There are no direct mentions of the 'A' residue here, but I need to check if it's part of the mutation description. Typically, mutations have lowercase letters for amino acid residues (e.g., A30P). Since this is a missense mutation with an 'A', I should clarify whether that's considered part of the mutation name or just the description.
   - In some contexts, mutation names are in uppercase like TP53 or G54H, but when described as A30P, it might be better to consider it as part of the mutation details rather than the core gene name.

2. **A53T Mutation**:
   - Again, this is a missense mutation in alpha-syn.
   - The paragraph mentions that E46K and A53T are associated with familial PD forms.
   - There's no mention of 'T' here, but considering the standard naming convention, it might be part of the mutation name or part of the description.

3. **E46K Mutation**:
   - Similar to the above, this is another missense mutation in alpha-syn.
   - The paragraph mentions that E46K is associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial PD.
   - No explicit mention of 'K', so perhaps it's part of the description or a minor detail.

Now, considering standard medical literature terminology, mutations are often described as either missense (changing a single amino acid residue) or coding (changing a codon). Since all these mutations involve changing an amino acid residue, they're all considered missense mutations. However, in some sources, coding mutations are also noted with uppercase letters.

To be thorough, I should note that the mutation names are often in uppercase (e.g., TP53) or lowercase (e.g., a1b), depending on the context and how it's described. If 'A' or 'T' are part of the mutation name, they may not be considered as residues but rather part of the gene identifier.

Next, I should identify the descriptions within the paragraph that explain what these mutations do in terms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The paragraph mentions that E46K and A53T mutations are associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial PD. It also says that E46K is impaired, particularly affecting memory function.

Therefore, I can extract mutation details such as:
- Mutation names (e.g., TP53 for alpha-syn).
- Missense residues: A in A30P, T in A53T, K in E46K.
- Descriptions of how these mutations contribute to PD, specifically affecting Lewy bodies and memory function.

It's important to note that the mutation names are not necessarily the same as their identifiers. For example, TP53 is the gene name, but when described as a missense mutation like A30P, it's part of the description rather than the core gene name.

Finally, I'll format this information into a JSON structure following the specified template. The JSON will include an array of mutations with their respective details.
