Okay, so I need to extract information about mutations from the given abstract. Let's start by reading through it carefully.

The abstract talks about mutations in protein DJ-1 being associated with Parkinson's disease. It uses solution state NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy on five different parkinsonian diseases linked mutations: L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A.

They compare the data with wild-type protein results. So here's what I notice:

- TheWild type has some structural perturbations.
- When the L166P mutation occurs, it leads to severe and global destabilization of the protein structure.
- E64D is nearly unperturbed, meaning little change there.

The remaining three mutants (M26I, A104T, D149A) have different degrees of structural perturbations. Also, their thermodynamic stability is reduced.

So from this, I can identify the specific mutations and their effects on protein structure and stability. This seems directly related to mutation information in the context of Parkinson's disease.

I don't see any mention of cDNA changes or protein changes in the abstract. It focuses more on the structural perturbations resulting from these mutations rather than variations in coding sequences like point mutations (variants).

Therefore, while there is mutation information regarding the structural effects, it doesn't include details about cDNA, protein changes, or variant descriptions.
