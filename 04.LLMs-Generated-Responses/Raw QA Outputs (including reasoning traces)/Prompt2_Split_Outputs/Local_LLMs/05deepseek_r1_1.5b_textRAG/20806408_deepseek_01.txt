Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract information about mutations related to the DJ-1 protein from this medical literature excerpt. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions that there are two novel mutations in the DJ-1 gene: one is a missense mutation causing L10P substitution, and the other is a deletion mutation resulting in P158 deletion. It also talks about comparing these mutants to wild-type (WT) proteins and their pathogenic variants, which includes an L166P variant.

The text then discusses protein stability by looking at degradation mediated by the proteasome. It notes that these mutations reduce protein stability, especially when other factors like MG-132 are present. Additionally, size-exclusion chromatography results show altered profiles and reduced solubility compared to WT. The cells expressing L10P showed increased susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors, suggesting potential toxicity.

Okay, so the key points here are:

1. **DJ-1 protein variants**: The two mutations studied are L10P and P158DEL.
2. **Protein stability**: Both mutants show reduced stability compared to WT and have higher degradation mediated by the proteasome.
3. **Subsolubility issues**: Deletion mutant P158DEL has increased solubility issues when MG-132 is present, while the deletion itself doesn't affect solubility as much.

Given that, I need to extract information about these mutations, specifically their names and any changes in protein stability or subcellular localization. Since the text isn't explicitly mentioning specific mutation types beyond the missense (L10P) and deletion (P158DEL), I should focus on what's clear.

I'll structure my JSON response with "Gene" field for DJ-1, including each mutant's name, their impact on protein stability, and any issues related to subcellular localization. Even though the text doesn't mention specific types of mutations beyond missense and deletion, listing both makes sense because they're distinct changes.

I should ensure that all relevant details are included accurately. The degradation part is important for understanding the pathogenicity, so I'll make sure that's captured even if it's not explicitly stated as a type of mutation in this context.

Finally, since the user didn't mention any other types of mutations or additional effects beyond what's described, I'll stick to listing the two mutants as specified.
