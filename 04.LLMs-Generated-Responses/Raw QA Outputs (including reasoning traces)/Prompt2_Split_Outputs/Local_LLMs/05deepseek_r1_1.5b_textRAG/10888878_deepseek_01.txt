Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The task is to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. First, I need to understand what exactly constitutes a mutation in the context of genetic studies. From what I know, mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can occur during cell division, leading to deviations from an individual's normal or average sequence. These deviations can affect gene expression and often result in diseases.

The provided paragraph discusses Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP), a common familial form of Parkinson's disease. It mentions that parkin, the gene product corresponding to a mutation in PARK2, is involved in protein degradation as an ubiquitin-protein ligase. Mutant parkins from AR-JP patients show loss of this activity.

The key part here is discussing mutations related to PARK2. In the context of genetic studies, mutations are often represented by changes in specific gene names or by describing changes in codons (variants) within those gene names.

Looking at the paragraph:

"In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

Here, "c.248G>A" indicates a codon change where residue G is changed to A at position 248 of the TP53 gene. This is a common notation used to describe codon changes. The phrase "(p.G83D)" follows, which stands for point mutation and description in input context, indicating that there's also an amino acid change—residue D instead of G—in position 83.

In another part:

"In a study of AR-JP patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with loss of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity."

This repeats the codon change and mutation description, reinforcing the genetic aspect.

I need to identify all mutations mentioned. In the first sentence:

- "c.248G>A"
- "(p.G83D)"

These represent changes in the amino acid sequence of the gene's coding sequence. The term "c." stands for codon change and is used to describe each position where a mutation occurs.

So, to summarize, I've identified two mutations:

1. **codon change (c.248G>A):** This indicates that residue G in position 248 of the TP53 gene is changed to A.
2. **amino acid change (p.G83D):** The residue D in position 83 of the amino acid sequence becomes G.

These are codon changes because they describe a change within a specific nucleotide position (codons) of a gene's coding sequence. Codon changes can lead to various types of mutations, including frameshifts and other genetic alterations that affect protein function.

In the context of this paragraph, these mutations are described in the input text along with their effects on the parkin gene product. Specifically, mutant parkins from AR-JP patients lose ubiquitin-protein ligase activity due to the loss of this specific mutation.

The extracted information should include both the codon and amino acid changes and their associated details as per the JSON format specified.
