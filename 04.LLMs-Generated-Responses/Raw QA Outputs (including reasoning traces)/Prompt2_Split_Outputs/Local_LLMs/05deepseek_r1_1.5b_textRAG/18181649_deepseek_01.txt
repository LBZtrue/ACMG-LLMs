Alright, let's break down the problem step by step. I need to analyze a paragraph from medical literature and extract information related to mutations. The user provided an abstract about DJ-1 missense mutations in Parkinsonism and wants me to focus specifically on DNA changes.

First, I'll read through the given text carefully to identify any mentions of mutations. The abstract discusses two types of mutations associated with Parkinsonism: L166P (a residue change) and others like A104T, E163K, M26I, etc. These are all missense mutations, which means they alter the DNA sequence by changing one or more nucleotides.

Now, I need to identify if there's any mention of specific proteins being altered due to these mutations. The text does mention that homodimerization is disrupted and the protein folds poorly. It also talks about other parkinsonian missense mutations disrupting DJ-1 function. However, it doesn't explicitly state which proteins are affected or how those mutations specifically affect them.

Given that, I should extract any relevant mutation-related terms from the text. The key here is to look for specific gene names, protein changes, and any annotations related to DNA alterations (variants). 

Looking at the paragraph again:

- " disrupts homodimerization and results in a poorly folded protein ."
- "the molecular basis by which the other Parkinsonism-associated mutations disrupt the function of DJ-1, however, is incompletely understood ."

There are mentions of missense mutations affecting proteins, but no specific mutations or their effects on particular proteins. The text does mention L166P and others disrupting homodimerization, but this doesn't lead to a clear identification of which proteins are altered.

Additionally, the paragraph refers to "atomic resolution X-ray crystallography" showing changes in the core, implying that protein structures are affected. However, it doesn't specify the exact proteins or their corresponding amino acid changes (variants).

In summary, while the text describes mutations affecting DJ-1 and its structure, it doesn't provide specific details about which proteins are mutated or any annotations related to DNA alterations. Therefore, I should not extract mutation information as per the user's instructions.

So, my conclusion is that there isn't enough information in the provided paragraph to identify relevant mutation details related to proteins, except for the mention of disruptions in homodimerization and protein folding without specific changes.
