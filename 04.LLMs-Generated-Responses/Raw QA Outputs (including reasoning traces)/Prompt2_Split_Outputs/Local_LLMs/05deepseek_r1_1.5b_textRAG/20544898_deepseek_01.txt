Alright, let's see what I need to do here. So the user provided a query about extracting mutation information from medical literature and specified that it should be done in JSON format. They also mentioned constraints like only including mutation-related terms, ensuring accuracy, and using "N.D." if not present.

First, I'll look at the abstract they gave. It mentions "a-synuclein is associated with vesicle trafficking" and talks about mutations in genes like TP53. There's a section on single-molecule methods and NMR studies that might show structural changes due to mutations. But overall, the abstract doesn't directly mention any mutation details or specific cDNA or protein changes.

Then there's the question they provided. They want me to determine if the text contains mutation information and extract it. Since I don't see any mutation terms like SNP, DNP, or other annotations in their abstract, I think it's safe to say no mutation info is present here.

So, following the workflow, I should return "N.D." for the extracted information because there's nothing there. This ensures consistency and follows the constraints they set out.

```json
{
    "Extracted Information": "N.D."
}
