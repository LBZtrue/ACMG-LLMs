Okay, so I need to figure out the role of a medical literature data mining expert and help extract mutation information from a given paragraph. The user provided an abstract about loss of parkin function in ARPD and some specific mutations in PD.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. It mentions parkin mutants with C-terminal deletions abrogating their association with cellular membranes. That sounds like a mutation where the C-terminal region is altered.

Next, there are N-terminal missense mutations within the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) that affect stability and degradation of parkin. This would involve changes in the UBL sequence causing these effects.

There's also evidence from a smaller parkin species showing no N-terminal UBL. So that seems like another mutation related to lack of this functional region.

I need to make sure I'm focusing only on mutations, not the other aspects. Since the user wants "N.D." if there's no mutation info, I should double-check each part for any mutation details.

In the first sentence about C-terminal deletions, it's specifically mentioning a deletion in the C-terminal region, which likely causes the mutation in parkin function. The second point talks about UBL changes causing degradation and rapid aggregation. That sounds like another mutation within the UBL domain. The third mention of a smaller species without N-terminal UBL is definitely a mutation.

I should list these mutations clearly with their gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, etc., just like in the example provided. That way, it's easy to see and analyze further.

I also need to ensure I don't miss any parts where mutations are explicitly stated but might be more general or less directly relevant. It's important to stick strictly to what's mentioned in the abstract for accurate extraction.

So, summarizing my approach: Identify all mentions of mutations (gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, etc.), extract them into a structured JSON format, and ensure no part is missing since the user emphasized that.
