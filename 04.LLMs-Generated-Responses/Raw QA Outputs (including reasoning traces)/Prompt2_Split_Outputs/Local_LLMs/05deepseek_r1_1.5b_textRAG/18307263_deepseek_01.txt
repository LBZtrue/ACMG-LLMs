Alright, let's dive into this query. I'm faced with extracting mutation information from a medical literature abstract. The user has provided a detailed context about compound heterozygous PINK1 mutations and a specific patient case.

First, I need to identify if there are any mentions of mutations in the text. Scanning through the abstract, it does talk about "compound heterozygous mutations" specifically mentioning p.A244G and p.V317I. These details directly relate to genetic alterations that could be considered mutations or cDNAs.

Next, I'll extract relevant details. The genes involved are PINK1 with mutations in specific positions. Each mutation is described as eliminating the wild-type's protective effect against staurosporine-induced apoptosis. This part indicates functional changes within the gene product.

Additionally, it's mentioned that both mutations abolish the wild-type's effect. While this seems more like a functional consequence rather than an explicit mutation (like a substitution), I'll include it to show the broader impact on PINK1's function.

The study involves a patient with late onset PD and rapid progression. This information isn't directly related to mutations but gives context about the phenotype, which could be useful for future research or discussion in the literature.

I should structure this information clearly, ensuring each mutation is listed with its respective gene name and position details. The functional impact is important enough to include, even if it's a secondary effect.

Finally, I'll format this data into a JSON object as per the user's specifications, making sure all fields are included and accurately represent the extracted information. If no mutations were found or mutation-related terms weren't present, the output would be "N.D.", but in this case, there is clear mutation information.
