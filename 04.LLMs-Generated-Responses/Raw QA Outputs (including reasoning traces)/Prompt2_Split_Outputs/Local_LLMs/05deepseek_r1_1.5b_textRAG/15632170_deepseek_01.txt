Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed abstract from a medical literature and is asking for the extraction of mutation information related to specific gene repeats in the amino-terminal region of -synuclein.

First, I need to understand what exactly constitutes a mutation within the context of protein sequences. A mutation typically refers to a change in one or more nucleotides in the DNA sequence that affects the resulting protein structure and function. In this case, the focus is on KTKEGV-type repeats, which are found in the amino-terminal region of -synuclein.

Looking at the abstract provided, it discusses two specific mutations: E46K (Glutamic Acid to Leucine) and A53T (Asparagine to Asparaguanine). Both mutations affect certain residues within these repeats. The abstract also mentions that Glu residues in these repeats may play a significant role in regulating the ability of -synuclein to polymerize into amyloid fibrils.

The goal is to extract relevant mutation details, specifically focusing on gene names and any cDNA changes or protein changes associated with these mutations. However, it's important to note that the user wants only mutation-related information, not general medical literature data.

To proceed, I'll start by identifying all terms related to mutations in the provided text. The word "mutation" is present multiple times, but I need to look for more specific details like gene names and residue changes.

Next, focusing on gene names, I see that KTKEGV-type repeats are mentioned as being distributed throughout most of the amino-terminal half of -synuclein. This suggests a focus on these repeats as potential targets for mutations or changes in their structure.

Regarding cDNA changes, the abstract refers to the change from A53T (Asparagine to Asparaguanine) to E46K (Glutamic Acid to Leucine). I need to extract any specific cDNA variants associated with these mutations. From what's provided, there are no other cDNA changes mentioned beyond the two specific mutations.

For protein changes, the abstract mentions that Glu residues in these repeats may be important in regulating the ability of -synuclein to polymerize into amyloid fibrils and further indicate their significant effects on assembly. However, it doesn't specify any particular protein changes or alterations beyond what's already mentioned about Glu residues.

Since the user specifically asked for mutation details related to gene repeats in KTKEGV-type repeats, I should focus only on extracting information that pertains directly to mutations within these repeats. The abstract provides enough context to note the specific mutations but doesn't include any additional mutation-related data beyond what's already mentioned.

Given this analysis, while there is mutation information provided, it doesn't meet the criteria of specifically extracting details related to KTKEGV-type repeat mutations or cDNA changes in gene names. It also doesn't provide any new mutation details beyond the two specific ones discussed.

Therefore, based on the user's instructions and the content provided, I should indicate that there isn't enough information to provide a complete extraction of mutation details as per their request. The appropriate response would be "N.D." (Not Determined) since the required mutation-related information isn't present in the text.
