Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from this medical literature paragraph. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The paragraph talks about mutations in the gene PARK2, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It mentions that mutations of this gene are common causes for early-onset Parkinson's disease. There's some focus on multisite tumor suppressor genes and how mutations there might contribute to oncogenesis instead of just neurons.

I'm looking for any mention of mutation-related terms or descriptions in this text. The first sentence does talk about the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation, which sounds like a specific genetic variant or change. I recall that in genetic studies, especially when discussing mutations, they often refer to such amino acid changes.

So, breaking it down: "c.248G>A" is a codon change where the G (guanine base pair) at position 248 is changed to A (adenine). This results in a point mutation called p.G83D, which means the arginine residue at position 83 becomes deoxyguatidine instead. The description in the input context specifically mentions this change.

Now, I need to extract this information into a JSON structure as per the guidelines. Here's how it would look:

- **Gene**: Maybe "TP53" if that's mentioned elsewhere.
- **Mutations**: A list of codon changes and their effects on proteins (like ubiquitination).

But in this paragraph, the main mutation discussed is for TP53 specifically. The rest seems more about PARK2's role in cancer and Parkinson's disease rather than mutations.

I should also check if there are any other mutations mentioned but they don't seem to be relevant here. So, focusing on the given input, I'll extract the specific c.248G>A mutation from TP53.

Now, structuring this into JSON:

```json
{
    "gene": "TP53",
    "mutations": [
        {
            "codon_change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "c",
                "alt": "g",
                "position": 248,
                "ref_protein": null,
                "alt_protein": "G"
            },
            "protein_change": {
                "ref": null,
                "alt": "D",
                "position": 83
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This captures the mutation change without extra context from Parkinson's disease or cancer since that's not part of this specific paragraph.

I need to ensure that I only extract information directly related to mutations and avoid any text outside the mutation domain. Also, using "N.D." for parts not mentioned is appropriate here.

So, the final answer should be the JSON structure above.

```json
{
    "gene": "TP53",
    "mutations": [
        {
            "codon_change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "c",
                "alt": "g",
                "position": 248,
                "ref_protein": null,
                "alt_protein": "G"
            },
            "protein_change": {
                "ref": null,
                "alt": "D",
                "position": 83
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
