Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text paragraph about mutations and asks me to extract mutation-related information. First, I need to understand the key terms related to mutations mentioned in that paragraph.

Looking at the example given, they defined "variant" as a change in nucleotide sequence in DNA or RNA. So mutations are changes in these sequences, which can affect gene function and lead to disease.

In the text provided, there are two variants: G2019S and Y1699C. These appear to be specific cDNA changes where certain nucleotides replace others. For instance, G2019S means the G nucleotide at position 2019 is changed to S.

Next, I need to identify how these mutations impact other entities mentioned. The paragraph talks about transgenic flies expressing different LRRK2 alleles and their effects on dopaminergic neurons in DA loss clusters. Additionally, it mentions reduced lifespan and increased sensitivity to rotenone, a mitochondrial inhibitor.

The user wants me to extract details related to these mutations. Since the text doesn't explicitly mention gene names or protein changes beyond the specific variants, I can infer that the main focus is on identifying the mutation types—specific cDNA changes—and their locations in the genetic sequence.

I should not include any information about other factors like mitochondrial sensitivity unless it's directly linked to the mutations discussed. Since the text doesn't provide details on how these mutations affect mitochondria, I won't extract those aspects.

Therefore, the extracted information will focus on recognizing the mutation types and their nucleotide changes, as outlined in the example provided.
