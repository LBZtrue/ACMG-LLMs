Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a detailed abstract and question about mutations related to Parkinson disease and the A30P mutant. My task is to extract mutation information from the given text.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully to identify any mention of mutations or specific cDNA changes. Scanning through the paragraphs, I see mentions like "A30P mutant accelerates nucleation-dependent fibrillization of wild type (WT) ␣-synuclein." That sounds like a potential mutation context.

Next, looking for cDNA changes within these statements: The text refers to "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" in the TP53 gene and mentions specific amino acid substitutions in ␣-synuclein. Both of these are clear signs of mutations related to the A30P mutation.

I also notice that the abstract discusses the effects on fibrillization, which could relate to signaling pathways affected by the mutation, though this isn't directly a mutation itself but more about protein interactions.

There's no mention of specific gene names or cDNA changes outside of TP53 and ␣-synuclein. So I won't extract any additional information beyond what's already identified.

Since there are mutations mentioned, I need to format the data accordingly as per the JSON template. Extracting the relevant details like the A30P mutant cDNA change and its effect on wild type proteins should be included in the output.

Finally, after organizing everything into the required JSON structure without any additional comments or fields omitted, I'll present it as the answer.
