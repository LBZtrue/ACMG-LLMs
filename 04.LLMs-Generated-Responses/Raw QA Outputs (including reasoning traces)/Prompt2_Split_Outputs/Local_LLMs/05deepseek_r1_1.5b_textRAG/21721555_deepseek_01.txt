Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. The user provided an abstract and an introduction about alpha-synuclein misfolding and Parkinson's disease. My goal is to determine if there are any mutations mentioned there.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. It talks about human and mouse alpha-synuclein aggregation differences. The mention of PD in the introduction already points towards potential mutations in their proteins.

I notice that the abstract discusses growth kinetics, lag times, secondary structure propensities, substitutions like A53T and S87N. These are all mutations related to amino acids changes altering protein structures or function.

The question is about whether mutation information is present. Looking at specific terms: there's an A53T substitution and an S87N substitution. These are both known amino acid substitutions affecting protein structure, which could lead to conformational changes (like in the human-mouse chimeras mentioned).

However, the focus seems more on the effect of mutations rather than the mutation itself. The abstract doesn't mention specific cDNA changes or protein alterations but rather how mutations affect growth rates and secondary structures.

So, based on this analysis, there are mutations related to amino acid substitutions (A53T and S87N) that influence Parkinson's disease in humans and their transgenic counterparts.
