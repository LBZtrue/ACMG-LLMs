Okay, I need to analyze the given paragraph and extract information related to mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). First, I'll read through the paragraph carefully to understand what it's saying.

The paragraph begins by introducing that mutations in LRRK2 are common causes of late-onset autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. It mentions that some disease-associated mutations directly affect LRRK2 kinase activity and inhibition of LRRK2 is viewed as a potential therapeutic treatment.

Next, the author demonstrates by both binding assays and enzymatic assays that alterations in kinase activity are due to changes in ATP affinity. Binding assays show G2019S has approximately 2-fold lower ATP affinity compared to wild-type LRRK2, while I2020T shows a 6-fold increase. Using an in vitro kinase activity assay at cellular ATP levels (1 mM), I2020T is about 10-fold more resistant to ATP-competitive inhibitors than wild-type, whereas G2019S is only 1.6-fold more sensitive.

This information pertains directly to the mutations G2019S and I2020T in LRRK2 kinase, focusing on their effects on ATP affinity. It also discusses how these changes impact kinase inhibitor potency in vitro or in cellular models.

I need to extract specific details:
- The gene names of the mutations: G2019S and I2020T
- Changes made by the mutations (variants)
- Protein changes caused by the mutations
- Any specific mutations or alterations described

After reviewing all this, it's clear that the paragraph provides detailed mutation information for G2019S and I2020T in LRRK2 kinase. The focus is on how these mutations affect ATP affinity and kinase inhibitor responses, which are key points related to the role of mutations in PD.

I should format this information accurately in JSON structure as specified:
- "Gene": List containing all relevant gene names
- "variants": An array of objects with "cDNA Change", "Protein Change", and "Description in input context"

It's important to ensure that all relevant mutation details are captured without including any non-relevant or unrelated information.
