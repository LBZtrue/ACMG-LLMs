Alright, so I need to figure out whether the paragraph contains mutation information and extract relevant details about mutations. Let's start by reading through the provided abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and talks about its role in autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease. It also discusses a novel molecular feature of the I2020T mutant LRRK2, which has higher susceptibility to post-translational degradation compared to wild-type LRRK2.

Next, it goes on to talk about the protective effect of I2020T LRRK2 against hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. It notes that when proteolysis inhibitors are allowed to treat the protein, the protective effect is impaired. However, without proteolysis inhibition (knocking down), the protective effect becomes enhanced.

Furthermore, it confirms that a decrease in intracellular protein level of wild-type LRRK2 by knocking down results in reduced protection against apoptosis. These findings suggest that higher susceptibility of I2020T mutant LRRK2 to cellular degradation may be part of the neurodegeneration associated with this LRRK2 mutation.

Now, looking through these sentences, I don't see any mention of mutations specifically or detailed genetic changes. All the discussion revolves around the molecular feature and some functional studies involving LRRK2, including kinase mutations (I2020T) and proteolysis effects on apoptosis and protein levels. There's no information about specific gene alterations, cDNA changes, protein changes, or mutation descriptions.

Given this, I don't see any mutation-related information in the paragraph. It seems to focus more on LRRK2's role in Parkinson's disease, its mutations (like I2020T), and functional studies involving proteolysis effects on apoptosis.
