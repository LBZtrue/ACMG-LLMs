Okay, so I'm trying to understand how this person is going to extract mutation information from a medical literature paragraph. The user has provided a detailed JSON template, which means they want the answer structured in that specific format. They also mentioned it's all about professional data mining, so I need to ensure my approach aligns with their standards.

First, let me look at the example provided. It seems like they're extracting gene names and variants related to mutations. The input text has a mutation where there’s a cDNA change and a protein change. In this case, it's TP53 (gene), c.248G>A (variant), and p.G83D (mutation). The output shows the gene name and two specific variant details.

Now, applying that to the given paragraph:

The paragraph talks about missense mutations in a-synuclein causing diseases like Parkinson's and dementia. It specifically mentions E46K mutation in a-synuclein being described for an inherited form of dementia with Lewy bodies. The key part here is "E46K" – that’s the cDNA change they're looking for.

I need to identify all instances where mutations are described, especially those related to amino acid changes (cDNAs) in a-synuclein, as these lead directly to protein mutations. In this case, it's an E46K mutation in a-synuclein.

So, my plan is:

1. Read the paragraph carefully and identify mentions of missense mutations in a-synuclein.
2. Extract gene names for a-synuclein from each mention.
3. Identify the specific amino acid changes (cDNA) that are described as mutation changes in the a-synuclein context.

In this case, the only mention is E46K in a-synuclein causing increased binding to negatively charged liposomes and similar filament assembly rates. This should be extracted with its gene name.

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other mutations related to a-synuclein mentioned elsewhere in the paragraph. But from what's provided, it seems like E46K is the only relevant mutation here.

Also, following the user’s instructions, if there are no relevant mutations, I should return "N.D." instead of N.A. but that doesn't apply here since we found a mutation.

Finally, structuring this information according to the JSON template provided: Gene and variants.

Let me make sure I don’t include anything unrelated or just extra information in case there's more mutation data elsewhere, but based on what’s given, it's only E46K.
