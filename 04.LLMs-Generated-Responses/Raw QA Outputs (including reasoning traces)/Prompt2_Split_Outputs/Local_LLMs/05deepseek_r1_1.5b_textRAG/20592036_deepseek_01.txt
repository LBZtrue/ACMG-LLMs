Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a detailed context and an abstract from medical literature about synuclein and Parkinson disease. They specifically want to extract mutation information related to the PD-linked mutations.

First, I need to identify any mention of mutations in the text. The abstract discusses the three PD-linked mutations that lead to early-onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism. There's also a background mentioning the role of these mutations in neurodegeneration and their association with specific genes.

I should look for terms like "point mutations," "S point mutations," or any other descriptions related to amino acid changes within the mutations. In this case, the PD-linked mutations have three S point mutations that cause the early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism.

Since none of the text directly mentions a cDNA change (a synonymous substitution) in the context of these mutations, I need to consider whether the user is expecting information about protein or genetic changes. However, the user's profile and goals suggest they're interested in amino acid changes, so including the point mutations related to the PD-linked issues makes sense.

I should structure this information clearly, listing each mutation along with its specific details, especially any cDNA changes if mentioned. Since there are no actual cDNA changes noted, I'll focus on the amino acid variations described by the PD-linked mutations.

Finally, I need to format this as per the user's examples. Each mutation will be listed under a "Gene" field with "variants" containing the specific details about each mutation. If they're missing, like in this case, I should supplement with "N.D." but not include it unless there's actual information.
