Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if there's any mutation information in the provided text about LRRK2 and its 14-3-3 isoforms. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.

Okay, the abstract talks about mutations in LRRK2 being significant but little understood regarding their regulation or function. It then goes on to discuss that 14-3-3 protein isoforms interact with LRRK2 and that endogenous LRRK2 from Swiss 3T3 cells or various mice shows a relationship with 14-3-3 isoforms.

Wait, but none of these parts mention mutations at all. They're just talking about the role of 14-3-3 in interacting with LRRK2. There's no mention of any mutations or changes to genes or protein activity here. So, it seems like this paragraph doesn't contain any mutation information.

Since I'm trying to find out if there are mutations related to LRRK2 and its isoforms based on 14-3-3 binding, and the abstract itself doesn't discuss that, I don't think there's any mutation data here. It would be a bit confusing for someone who's looking for specific mutations related to this interaction.

I remember that in medical literature, especially when discussing mutations, you usually see terms like "mutations", "codon changes", or "specific gene names". In this case, though, the abstract doesn't mention any of those. It just describes how 14-3-3 interacts with LRRK2 and looks at the endogenous forms from different sources.

So, putting it all together, there's no mutation information in the provided paragraph that I'm looking at. It seems like this text is more about the relationship between 14-3-3 isoforms and LRRK2 rather than any mutations or changes within LRRK2 itself.

The provided abstract does not contain any mutation information related to LRRK2 or its interaction with 14-3-3 protein isoforms. It focuses on the role of 14-3-3 in interacting with LRRK2 and examining the endogenous forms from various sources. There is no mention of mutations, gene changes, or specific mutation descriptions within this text.
