Alright, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given paragraph about LRRK2 mutations. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, I'll look for any mention of genetic mutations related to LRRK2. The paragraph talks about disease-associated mutations such as R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T. These mutations were found to reduce interaction with Akt1 and phosphorylate it, suggesting a possible neurodegenerative mechanism.

Next, I'll examine the specific mutations:

- **R1441C**: This mutation changes Leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) from LRR to RC. It's mentioned in the context of LRRK2 signaling and phosphorylation.
  
- **G2019S**: Here, Gln is changed to Ser. The paragraph mentions that one of the amino acids essential for Akt1 activation is Ser473, which was the target site for LRRK2. This implies that this mutation affects activation of Akt1.

- **I2020T**: Ileine-rich repeat kinase (IIP) is affected in this mutation, which also interacts with and phosphorylates Akt1. The interaction is noted, showing a possible link between IIP mutations and neurodegeneration.

Additionally, the paragraph notes that knockdown experiments using intact cells demonstrated LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt1 on Ser473, indicating that Akt1 is a strong candidate for its physiological substrate. It also mentioned that R1441C and G2019S mutations reduced interaction with Akt1.

I need to structure this information in the specified JSON format, extracting gene names, variants (cDNA changes), protein changes, and mutation descriptions. I'll make sure not to include any "N.D." unless specific information is missing.

So, for each mutation:

- **R1441C** affects LRRK2's structure.
- **G2019S** alters Leucine-rich repeat kinase (IIP) kinase activity.
- **I2020T** also impacts IIP kinase and activation of Akt1.

The JSON should include a "Gene" field with the appropriate names and a "variants" object that lists each mutation's cDNA change, protein change, position, etc. Each variant should have its own entry in the array.

Let me draft this out clearly to ensure all necessary details are captured accurately.
