Alright, let's dive into this. The user is asking about the role of mutations related to DJ-1 gene in early-onset Parkinsonism. I need to look through the provided abstract and see if there are any mentions of these mutations.

Starting with the first paragraph: It talks about how mutations in DJ-1 lead to AR-EOP, which is a type of early onset Parkinsonism with autosomal recessive inheritance. The abstract also mentions that the PAK2 gene (which I think is Parkin) plays a role in this condition and that DJ-1 interacts with SUMO proteins, possibly acting as an antioxidant.

Now, looking at the second paragraph: This seems to be about the effects of DJ-1 on cell death under various stresses like oxidative stress, ER stress, proteasome inhibition, etc. It also mentions a PAK1 mutation in juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP). 

The third and fourth paragraphs discuss specific experiments where they used siRNA to down regulate DJ-1 and then observed changes in neuronal cell line apoptosis or death induced by other stresses. They found that over-expressing wild-type DJ-1 rescued apoptosis caused by PAK1, which is a Parkin-related gene product.

Looking through the whole text, I don't see any mention of mutations specifically related to DJ-1 or PAK2/PAK1 genes. Most talks are about the role and effects of these proteins on cell death and Parkinsonism, not the specific genetic mutations associated with them.

So, based on this analysis, there's no mutation information in the literature provided for DJ-1 gene in AR-EOP or Parkin gene in AR-JP. Therefore, I should return "N.D." as per the guidelines.
