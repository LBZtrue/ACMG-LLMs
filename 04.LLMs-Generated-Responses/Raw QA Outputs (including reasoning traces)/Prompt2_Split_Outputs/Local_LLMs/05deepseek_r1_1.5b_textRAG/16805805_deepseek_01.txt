Alright, so I'm looking at this query where the user is asking about mutations related to PINK1 gene mutations in Parkinson's disease. First, they provided some text from a study by Valente et al. 2004b. From what I can see, the paragraph discusses how PINK1 protein localization relates to Lewy bodies (LBs) in PD brains. It mentions that PINK1 cleaves and localizes to mitochondria through specific N-terminal targeting motifs.

Now, the user is specifically interested in mutation information. They want to know if any mutations are mentioned. Scanning through the text again, I don't see any mention of cDNA changes or protein changes related to PINK1. The paragraph talks about PINK1's localization but doesn't delve into any mutations associated with it.

I need to determine if this mutation information is present at all. Since there's no mention of any mutations in the provided text, I should respond accordingly by returning "N.D." as instructed. However, just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check if any terms like "mutations," "point mutations," or "cDNA changes" appear. But upon review, they don't seem to be included.

So, my conclusion is that there's no mutation information in the provided paragraph related to PINK1 gene mutations in PD. Therefore, I'll provide "N.D." as the extracted information.
