Alright, let's dive into this problem. The user has provided a text paragraph from medical literature and is asking if there are any mutations mentioned. They've given specific instructions on how to extract this information using JSON format.

First, I need to carefully read the input text. It's about parkin gene mutations in Parkinson's disease. I'll look for terms related to mutations—words like "point mutants," "cDNA changes," or other mutation-specific terms.

I notice that the paragraph talks about point mutants of parkin and their effects on enzyme activity, protein aggregation, etc. However, it doesn't mention any specific mutations with their gene names or cDNA changes. It's mostly about how these mutations affect parkin's function rather than identifying particular genetic variants.

Since the user is looking for mutation details like gene names, cDNA changes, and protein alterations, I'll check if such information exists. From my reading, there are no explicit mutations listed with their specific gene identifiers or detailed cDNA change data. The focus is more on the outcomes of these mutations rather than pinpointing which mutations occur.

Therefore, based on the provided text, there isn't enough mutation-related information to extract any relevant details. The user wants accurate extraction, and since that's not possible here, I'll return "N.D." to indicate no DNA found.
