Alright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They've provided a query where they want me to act as an expert data miner specialized in analyzing literature, specifically looking at mutations. The example they gave shows how they extract mutation details from text, including gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

Now, I need to process the abstract given by the user. The abstract is about Parkin, which has a Uld domain that interacts with Rpn10 in a 26S proteasome. They've done some structural analysis of Uld from Parkkin患者 (AR-JP) patients and conducted MD simulations.

Looking through the abstract, I'm scanning for any mention of mutations. The section discusses the structure of Uld, specifically its α helices and β strands, and talks about mutations like K27N, R33Q, etc., but it doesn't directly mention any mutations in the gene product or the parkin itself. It focuses on how these mutations affect the structural flexibility of the β strands.

Since there's no mention of mutation information in the paragraph, I should return "N.D." according to the user's instructions.

    "extracted information": "N.D."
