Alright, let's break down how I approached this task.

First, I needed to understand what was being asked. The user provided a paragraph from medical literature and asked if it contains information about mutations. If it does, they wanted specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions. If not, they wanted "N.D.".

So, I started by reading the paragraph carefully to look for any mention of mutations. The paragraph talked about Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease and Dementia with mutations in the αS gene, specifically E46K, A30P, and A53T mutations. It mentioned that these mutations affect oligomerization and affect seed formation.

Next, I checked if any parts of this text referred to specific genes or mutations. The paragraph refers to genes like TP53 but doesn't mention any mutation details beyond the cDNA changes associated with the E46K and A30P mutations.

I didn't find any direct mention of mutations in a specific gene besides those mentioned. So, I concluded that there wasn't mutation information in this paragraph. Therefore, I filled that section with "N.D." to indicate no detailed mutation data was present.
