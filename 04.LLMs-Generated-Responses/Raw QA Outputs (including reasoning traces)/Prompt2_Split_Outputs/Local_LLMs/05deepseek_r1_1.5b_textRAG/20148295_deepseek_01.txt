Alright, let's dive into this task. So, the user provided a detailed query about extracting mutation information from medical literature. They want me to act as an expert in analyzing academic sources and dissecting specific details.

First, I need to understand exactly what they're asking for. They mentioned a JSON template format, so my response should be structured in that way. The goal is to extract any mutation-related terms or descriptions from the provided text. If there are no mutations found, I have to return "N.D."

Now, looking at the example they gave: 

"In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with tumor progression."

I see how mutations are identified here. The variant "c.248G>A" includes a change from G to A at position 248, which is a classic genetic marker for specific conditions.

Given that, I need to carefully read each paragraph of the provided text and look for mentions of mutations. If any mutation terms or descriptions are found within a sentence, they should be extracted in JSON format with the necessary details.

I also notice that if there's no mention of mutations, simply returning "N.D." is appropriate. So, I must ensure my extraction only reports mutations when found and doesn't include the "N.D." placeholder otherwise.

It's important to note that the user wants accurate and comprehensive information, so I need to be meticulous in extracting precise details about each mutation—gene names, changes, protein alterations, etc.

I'll proceed by reading through the provided text, identify any mutation terms, extract them accurately, and present it neatly in JSON format as specified. If no mutations are found, clearly state "N.D.".

```json
{
    "mutations_found": false,
    "mutations_list": []
}
