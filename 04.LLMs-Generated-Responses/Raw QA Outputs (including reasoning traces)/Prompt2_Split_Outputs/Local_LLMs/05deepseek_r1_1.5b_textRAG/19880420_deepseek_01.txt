Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from a given paragraph about Parkinson disease and parkin/pink1 mutations. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context of the paragraph. The abstract mentions that mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) or parkin cause autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson disease (PD), but how these mutations trigger neurodegeneration is poorly understood. There are some research findings here.

The paragraph also talks about PINK1 regulating the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase function of parkin through direct phosphorylation, which enhances parkin-mediated ubiquitin signaling. The ability of PINK1 to promote parkin phosphorylation and activate parkin-mediated ubiquitin signaling is impaired by PD-linked pathogenic PINK1 mutations.

Okay, so looking at this, I need to identify any mentions of mutations specifically related to parkin or pink1. Let me go through each sentence one by one.

1. It says that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in TP53 is associated with tumor progression. This seems like a genetic variant but not directly about mutation-related pathways involving parkin or pink1.

2. PINK1 regulates E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase function of parkin through direct phosphorylation. Here, both PINK1 and parkin are mentioned in the context of their interaction. This part might indicate that mutations in either could affect signaling via pinks.

3. The ability of PINK1 to promote parkin phosphorylation is impaired by PD-linked pathogenic mutations. Again, this mentions PD-related mutations but not specifically about mutations in pinks or pink1.

4. Furthermore, the ability of PINK1 to promote parkin phosphorylation and activate parkin-mediated ubiquitin signaling is impaired by PD-linked pathogenic PINK1 mutations. This reinforces that the focus here is on PD pathogenic mutations involving pinks.

Now, looking for mutations in the context of parkins or pink1:

- The initial paragraph talks about genetic variants (like c.248G>A) but doesn't mention any mutations themselves.
- There's a specific variant mentioned: c.248G>A (p.G83D), but it's part of a larger genetic change rather than a mutation itself.

Are there any other mentions? Not that I can see right now.

The paragraph does discuss pathways involving pinks but doesn't provide information on mutations themselves—merely talking about the functions and impairments caused by PD-linked pathogenic mutations in pinks.

So, based on this analysis, I don't find any direct mutation information related to parkins or pink1 mentioned. All references are either genetic variants, signaling pathways, or the effects of specific mutations rather than detailing any actual mutations themselves.

Therefore, extracting mutation information from this paragraph isn't possible.
