Okay, let me start by reading through the provided abstract carefully. The user wants to know if there's any mutation information mentioned here. The question is about extracting mutation details related to alpha-synuclein and Parkinson's disease.

Looking at the first part, the abstract mentions that alpha-synuclein is associated with Parkinson's disease. Then, there's a sentence that says, "the identification of single point mutations and gene duplication/triplication that are causally linked to early-onset familial PD." The references here are 5-8. So, it's talking about mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene leading to PD. 

Now, I need to check if specific mutations are mentioned. The text says "single point mutations and gene duplication/triplication." However, it doesn't list any specific mutations like c. or p. changes. The terms used are general: "single point mutations" and "gene duplication or triplication." There's no mention of exact positions or nucleotide changes. 

The user's example shows that if specific mutations are present, they should be extracted. But here, the abstract only refers to types of mutations (point mutations, duplication, triplication) without specifying any. So, the answer should be "N.D." for each part since there's no concrete mutation data provided beyond the general terms. 

I need to make sure the JSON is filled out with "N.D." for all fields since the required information like gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions aren't specified. Even though the abstract mentions mutations, it's too vague to extract specific details. Therefore, the correct response is to return "N.D." for each component.
