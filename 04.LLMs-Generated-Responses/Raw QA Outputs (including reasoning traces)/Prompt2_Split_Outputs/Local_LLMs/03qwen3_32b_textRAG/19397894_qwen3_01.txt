Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the literature. The context is about LRRK2 mutations in Parkinson's disease.

First, I need to check if there are any mentions of mutations. The abstract and introduction mention two specific mutations: I2020T and G2019S. These are located in the kinase domain's activation loop. 

Looking at the gene name, it's clearly stated as LRRK2. Now, for the variants. The first mutation is I2020T. Let's break that down. The protein change is from Isoleucine (I) at position 2020 to Threonine (T). The cDNA change isn't specified here, so I'll have to put N.D. for the transcript, ref, alt, and position in cDNA. 

The second mutation is G2019S. Similarly, the protein change is Glycine (G) at position 2019 to Serine (S). Again, the cDNA details aren't provided, so those fields will be N.D. 

The description in the context for I2020T mentions it's in the activation loop of the kinase domain and has lower kinase activity. For G2019S, it's also in the activation loop, associated with higher kinase activity. The text also notes their effects on ATP affinity and inhibitor sensitivity, which are part of the mutation's impact. 

I need to structure the JSON with the gene name and variants array. Each variant should have cDNA and protein changes. Since the cDNA changes aren't mentioned, those fields will be N.D. The protein changes are clear from the mutation notations. 

I should make sure not to include any extra information beyond what's directly stated. The examples provided show that even if some fields are missing, they should be filled with N.D. So, the final JSON should list both mutations with the available protein changes and N.D. for cDNA parts.
