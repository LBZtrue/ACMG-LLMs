Okay, let's start by looking at the provided context. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the given text.

First, I need to check if there are any mentions of mutations. In the abstract, the last sentence says, "The disease-associated mutations, R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T, exhibited reduced interaction with, and phosphorylation of, Akt1..." So those are the mutations listed here.

Now, I need to map these mutations into the required JSON format. The gene here is LRRK2, as that's the gene being discussed. Each mutation has a protein change. The format for the protein change is p.[ref][position][alt]. So R1441C would be R at position 1441 changing to C. Similarly for the others.

For the cDNA changes, the text doesn't mention any specific cDNA changes, so I'll put N.D. there. The transcript is also N.D. since it's not provided. The description in the input context is just the mutation name as given.

I need to make sure each variant is a separate object in the variants array. Let me structure each mutation accordingly. Also, check that all required fields are filled, using N.D. where information is missing.

So the final JSON should have the gene as LRRK2, and three variants with their respective cDNA and protein changes, along with the descriptions.
