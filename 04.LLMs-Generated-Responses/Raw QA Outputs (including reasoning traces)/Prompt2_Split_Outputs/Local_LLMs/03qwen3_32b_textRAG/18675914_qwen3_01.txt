Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to check if there are any mutations mentioned.

Looking at the abstract and introduction, the gene in question is LRRK2. The text mentions specific mutants: Y1699C and G2019S. Also, R1441C is mentioned in the introduction. 

For each mutation, I need to note the gene, cDNA changes, protein changes, and the description. However, the text doesn't provide cDNA changes (like the exact transcript, reference, alternate bases, or positions), so those will be "N.D." The protein changes are given as Y1699C, G2019S, and R1441C. 

The description in the context would be phrases like "Y1699C or G2019S mutants" and "Expression of LRRK2 mutant genes, such as Y1699C and R1441C".

I need to structure each variant as an object in the variants array. Make sure to use "N.D." where information isn't provided. Check the example to match the format exactly. Also, ensure the JSON is valid with proper commas and brackets.
