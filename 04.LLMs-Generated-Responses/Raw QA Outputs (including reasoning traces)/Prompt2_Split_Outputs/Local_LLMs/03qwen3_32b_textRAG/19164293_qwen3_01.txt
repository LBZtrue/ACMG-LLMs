Okay, let's start by reading through the provided abstract carefully. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information. The main focus here is on α-synuclein and its mutations, specifically the A30P mutant.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of gene names. The abstract talks about the α-synuclein gene, so the gene name is SNCA. 

Next, looking for cDNA changes. The mutation is described as A30P, which refers to an amino acid substitution. The format c.90G>C would correspond to position 90 in the cDNA (since A is the 30th amino acid, each amino acid is 3 nucleotides, so 30*3=90). The reference nucleotide is G, and the alternative is C. 

For the protein change, it's p.A30P. The reference amino acid is Alanine (A) at position 30, and it's changed to Proline (P). 

The description in the context is the A30P mutation. The abstract mentions that this mutation accelerates fibrillization and has distinct conformational changes. Also, it's linked to Parkinson's disease. 

I need to ensure that all fields are filled. The gene is SNCA. The variants include the cDNA change with transcript as N.D. since it's not specified. The protein change details are present. The description in the context is the A30P mutation. 

No other mutations are mentioned, so the variants array will have only this entry. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure to use "N.D." where information is missing, like the transcript ID for cDNA change.

A30P fibrils act as seeds for WT α-synuclein fibrillization, and the mutation affects both WT and A30P fibril conformation."
