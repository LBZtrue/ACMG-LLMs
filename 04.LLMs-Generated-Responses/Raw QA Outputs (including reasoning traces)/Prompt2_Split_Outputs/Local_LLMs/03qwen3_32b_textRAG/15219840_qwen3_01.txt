Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information from the provided medical literature abstract. First, I need to read through the abstract carefully to identify any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the first paragraph, the authors mention several mutants of DJ-1 found in Parkinson's disease patients: M26I, R98Q, D149A, and L166P. These are all protein changes, specifying the amino acid positions and the substitutions. So, each of these is a mutation in the DJ-1 gene. 

I need to note that the gene in question is DJ-1. For each mutation, I should extract the protein change details. The cDNA changes aren't provided here, so I'll have to leave those as "N.D." since the abstract doesn't mention them. 

The second paragraph talks about DJ-1's role in oncogenesis and other diseases but doesn't mention any specific mutations beyond what's already listed. So, all the mutation information is in the first paragraph. 

I should structure each variant with the protein change details. The cDNA Change will have "N.D." for transcript, ref, alt, and position. The description in the context is given as the mutation names like M26I, R98Q, etc. 

I need to make sure there are no other mutations mentioned. The text also refers to C106S, which is a protease activity mutant, but it's not listed as a Parkinson's disease mutation. However, in the context, it's mentioned as another mutant, so I should include it as well. Wait, the first paragraph says they analyzed other mutants including M26I, R98Q, D149A, and L166P. Then later, when discussing cell lines, they mention C106S. The question is whether C106S is a mutation found in Parkinson's patients. The text says "C106S, a mutant for protease activity" but doesn't state it's from PD patients. The initial analysis was about mutants found in PD patients. The C106S is part of the cell lines study but not listed as a PD mutation. So maybe C106S isn't part of the variants from PD patients. The user's question is about mutations found in Parkinson's disease patients. The first paragraph lists the four mutants (M26I, R98Q, D149A, L166P) as found in PD patients. The C106S is a different mutant, possibly not from PD. So in the JSON, should I include C106S? The example in the user's prompt includes all mutations mentioned in the context, not just those from PD. The first paragraph says they analyzed mutants found in PD patients, including the four, and then later mentions C106S as another mutant. The user's goal is to extract all mutation info from the text, regardless of whether they are PD-related. So C106S should be included as another variant. 

Therefore, the variants are M26I, R98Q, D149A, L166P, and C106S. Each of these has a protein change. The cDNA changes are not mentioned, so they remain N.D. Each variant's description in the context is their mutation name. 

I need to structure each variant in the JSON with the Gene as DJ-1 and each variant's details. Let me verify each one again. Yes, the first four are from PD patients, and C106S is another mutant used in the study. The user's example includes all mutations mentioned, so including C106S is correct here.
