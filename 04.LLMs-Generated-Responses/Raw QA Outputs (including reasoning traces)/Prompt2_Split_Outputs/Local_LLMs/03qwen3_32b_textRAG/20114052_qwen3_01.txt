Okay, let's start by reading through the provided abstract carefully. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information if present.

The abstract mentions α-synuclein (α-syn) and a specific mutation site, E46K, linked to a familial form of Parkinson's disease. The term "E46K" refers to a substitution where glutamic acid (E) at position 46 is replaced by lysine (K). 

Now, I need to structure this into the required JSON format. The gene involved here is α-synuclein, which is often denoted as SNCA in gene nomenclature. However, the abstract just refers to it as α-syn. I'll use SNCA as the gene name since that's the standard symbol.

For the variant, the cDNA change isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll put "N.D." for transcript and any missing cDNA details. The protein change is E46K, so the reference amino acid is E (Glutamic acid), the alternative is K (Lysine), and the position is 46. 

The description in the context is given as "E46K," which is straightforward. I need to make sure all other fields are filled with "N.D." where information isn't provided. The user's example shows how to handle missing data, so I'll follow that. 

I should double-check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The abstract also talks about Lys34 and Tyr39 substitutions in synthetic peptides, but those are part of experimental manipulations (alanine substitutions) and not actual mutations in the protein. The E46K is the only mutation described as a variant associated with PD. 

So, the final JSON should include the gene as SNCA, the variant details with the protein change E46K, and the description. All other fields not mentioned are "N.D."
