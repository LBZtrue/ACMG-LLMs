Okay, let's start by reading the provided text carefully to identify any mutation-related information. The user wants me to extract details about mutations, specifically gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions if present.

First, the abstract mentions that mutations in the parkin gene are linked to Parkinson's disease. The gene name here is clearly "parkin". The text talks about "point mutants of parkin" which retain catalytic activity. The study analyzed 22 parkin point mutants. 

Now, I need to check if the text provides specific cDNA or protein changes. The example given in the user's prompt includes specific positions and changes like c.248G>A (p.G83D). However, in the provided literature, the mutations are described in a general sense. It mentions that over half of the mutations (22 in total) affect solubility and aggregation. But there are no specific cDNA or protein changes listed. The mutations are referred to as "point mutants" and "missense/nonsense mutations" without specifying the exact nucleotide or amino acid changes.

The text does not provide any specific examples of cDNA changes (like c.123A>T) or protein changes (like p.Arg45Gly). Instead, it discusses the effects of mutations in general terms. Therefore, the "cDNA Change" and "Protein Change" fields would need to be filled with "N.D." since there are no specific details provided. The "Description in input context" can be filled with the general description given, such as "parkin point mutants (22 in total)" and mentions of missense/nonsense mutations.

So, the gene is "parkin", and the variants section will have entries with "N.D." for cDNA and protein changes, but the description can include the information about the 22 mutants and the types of mutations.
