Okay, let me start by reading through the provided literature abstract carefully. The user wants to extract mutation information if present.

Looking at the background section, it mentions "Three missense mutations (A30P, A53T and E46K) in the α-syn gene are associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial PD." So right away, I see three mutations listed here. 

First, I need to identify the gene. The gene in question is α-synuclein, which is abbreviated as α-syn. The full name would be SNCA, as that's the standard gene symbol for α-synuclein. 

Next, the mutations listed are A30P, A53T, and E46K. These are all missense mutations. Each of these corresponds to a specific change in the protein. Let's break them down:

- A30P: Alanine at position 30 is replaced by Proline.
- A53T: Alanine at position 53 is replaced by Threonine.
- E46K: Glutamic acid at position 46 is replaced by Lysine.

Now, for each mutation, I need to extract cDNA changes and protein changes. However, the abstract doesn't provide the specific cDNA changes (like nucleotide positions and the actual nucleotide changes). The information given is only at the protein level. So for cDNA changes, the transcript, position, ref, and alt would all be "N.D." since they aren't mentioned.

Each mutation is described as a "missense mutation" in the context. The user's example shows that if the cDNA change isn't present, we should use "N.D." for those fields. The protein changes are straightforward based on the given amino acid substitutions.

I need to structure each variant as an object in the "variants" array. Each object should have the cDNA change (with N.D. where missing) and the protein change with the correct ref, alt, and position. The description in the input context would be the mutation name as listed (A30P, etc.), as well as the mention of them being associated with familial PD.

I should make sure that the gene is correctly identified as SNCA. Also, check that all three mutations are included as separate entries in the variants array. Since there's no mention of any other mutations in the text provided, these are the only ones to include.

No other mutations are discussed in the abstract, so the rest should be N.D. where applicable. The key is to stick strictly to what's mentioned in the literature without adding any inferred information.
