Okay, let's start by reading the provided text carefully. The user wants to extract mutation-related information from the literature. The context given is about Parkinson's disease and the A30P mutation in α-synuclein (aS). 

First, I need to check if there are any mentions of mutations. The abstract and introduction both mention the A30P mutation. The introduction also lists other mutations like E46K and A53T. 

The main focus here is on the A30P mutation. The question is about whether the mutation changes the structure of amyloid fibrils. The answer in the abstract says it doesn't, but the user is interested in extracting the mutation details.

Looking at the A30P mutation: it's a substitution where Alanine (A) at position 30 is replaced by Proline (P). The gene involved is α-synuclein, which is often abbreviated as SNCA. The cDNA change would be from G to C at position corresponding to codon 30. However, the text doesn't specify the exact cDNA change (like c.89G>C), so I have to note that as N.D. for transcript and position. 

The protein change is straightforward: p.A30P. The description in the context is "A30P mutation". The other mutations mentioned in the introduction (E46K, A53T) are part of the background but not discussed in detail in the current study, so they might not need to be included unless the user's query specifically asks for all mentioned mutations. However, the example provided only includes the mutation discussed in the context. The user's example shows that only the mentioned mutation is extracted, so I should focus on A30P here.

I need to structure the JSON according to the example. The gene is SNCA. The variants array includes the cDNA and protein changes. Since the cDNA details (transcript and position) aren't specified, they get "N.D." The protein change has ref (A), alt (P), and position (30). The description is "A30P mutation".

I should make sure there are no other mutations mentioned in the text that need extraction. The introduction mentions three mutations (A30P, E46K, A53T), but the current study focuses on A30P. The example given in the user's prompt only extracts the specific mutation discussed. So, I'll only include A30P here.
