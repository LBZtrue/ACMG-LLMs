Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants to extract mutation-related information. The context is about UCH-L1 and its role in Parkinson's disease. 

First, I need to look for mentions of specific mutations in the text. In the abstract, it mentions a mutation in UCH-L1 in familial Parkinson's disease. Then there's the D30K UCH-L1, which lacks ubiquitin binding activity. The C90S UCH-L1 is mentioned as lacking hydrolase activity. 

Looking at the introduction, they discuss mutations in a-synuclein like A30P and A53T. However, the question is about UCH-L1 mutations. 

In the abstract, the Parkinson's disease-associated mutation I93M is noted, which decreases secretion. Also, PD-linked a-synuclein mutants affect endogenous UCH-L1 secretion. 

So, the relevant mutations here are D30K, C90S, and I93M in UCH-L1. The A30P and A53T are in a-synuclein, which the user might not be interested in unless specified, but the question is about UCH-L1. 

The JSON structure requires Gene, variants with cDNA and protein changes. The user example shows cDNA as c.248G>A. However, the text here doesn't provide cDNA changes, only protein changes. So for D30K, it's p.D30K, C90S is p.C90S, and I93M is p.I93M. 

The cDNA changes are not mentioned, so those fields should be N.D. The description in context would be the mutation names as given. 

I need to make sure that only the UCH-L1 mutations are included. The a-synuclein mutations are in the introduction but not related to UCH-L1. 

So, the final JSON should list UCH-L1 as the gene with three variants: D30K, C90S, and I93M, each with their protein changes and descriptions. The cDNA parts are N.D. since they're not provided.
