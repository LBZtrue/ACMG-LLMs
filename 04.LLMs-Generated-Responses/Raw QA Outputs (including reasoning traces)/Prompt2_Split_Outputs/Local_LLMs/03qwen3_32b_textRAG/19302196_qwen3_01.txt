Okay, let me start by reading through the provided abstract carefully. The user wants me to determine if there's mutation information here and extract the relevant details.

The abstract mentions "Autosomal dominant mutations in the human Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene" as the most common monogenetic cause for Parkinson's disease. So right away, the gene name is LRRK2. 

Looking further, it talks about specific mutations like G2019S. The G2019S refers to a substitution where the 2019th amino acid, glycine (G), is replaced by serine (S). That's a protein change. The cDNA change isn't directly mentioned here, so I'll have to mark that as N.D. 

The abstract also states that the G2019S mutation is responsible for a certain percentage of cases in specific populations. The other mutations mentioned are in the context of being associated with Parkinson's disease, but the specific details are only given for G2019S. 

I need to check if there are other mutations mentioned. The text says "Autosomal dominant mutations in the LRRK2 gene" but doesn't list others beyond G2019S. So the only variant to extract is G2019S. 

For the cDNA change, since the position 2019 is in the protein, the cDNA position isn't provided, so it's N.D. The transcript is also not mentioned. 

The protein change is clearly G2019S. The description in the context is "G2019S" as the most prevalent mutation. 

I should structure the JSON with the gene name LRRK2 and the variant details. Since there's only one variant mentioned, the variants array will have a single entry. The other fields not mentioned will be N.D. 

I need to make sure that the JSON follows the example structure provided. The cDNA Change includes transcript, ref, alt, position. The Protein Change includes ref, alt, position. The description is the exact text from the context. 

Double-checking the references and the exact wording to ensure accuracy. No other mutations are specified, so only G2019S is included. All other fields where information is missing are filled with N.D.
