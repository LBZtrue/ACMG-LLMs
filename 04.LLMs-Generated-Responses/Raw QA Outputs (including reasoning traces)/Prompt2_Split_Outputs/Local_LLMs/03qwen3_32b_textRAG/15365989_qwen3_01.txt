Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to check if the text contains any mutation details.

Looking at the abstract, the first paragraph mentions the parkin gene mutations causing Parkinson's. Then it talks about the DJ1 gene with two mutations as PARK7. The specific mutation they found is c.192G4C (p.E64D). That's a clear cDNA and protein change. 

In the introduction, they discuss genetic factors in PD but don't mention specific mutations, so I can ignore that part. The main focus is on the DJ1 gene. The mutation c.192G4C translates to a protein change of E64D. 

I need to structure the JSON with the gene name as DJ1. The variants array should include the cDNA change with transcript as N.D. since it's not specified. The position is 192, ref is G, alt is C. The protein change is position 64, ref E, alt D. The description in the context is "c.192G4C (p.E64D)".

I should also check if there are other mutations mentioned. The text mentions two previously described mutations in DJ1, but the user is asking for the third one identified in the study. So only the c.192G4C is relevant here. 

Make sure to use "N.D." where information isn't provided, like the transcript in cDNA change. Also, confirm that the JSON structure is correct and matches the example given. No other genes or mutations are discussed in the provided text, so the answer should focus solely on DJ1 and the specified mutation.

    ]
