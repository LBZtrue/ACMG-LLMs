Okay, let's start by reading through the provided abstract and introduction to identify any mentions of mutations. The user is specifically interested in mutations related to the PINK1 gene, as indicated in the question.

First, the abstract mentions that "Mutations of the mitochondrial PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) induced kinase1 (PINK1) are important causes of recessive Parkinson disease (PD)." So right away, we know the gene involved is PINK1. 

Next, the abstract states, "clinical mutations impact on the function of Complex I..." and later, "human wild type PINK1, but not PINK1 containing clinical mutations, can rescue Complex 1 deficiency." This indicates that there are clinical mutations in PINK1. However, the specific details like cDNA changes or protein changes aren't provided here. The text doesn't include specific variants like c.248G>A or p.G83D as in the example. Instead, it refers to "clinical mutations" in general terms without specifying the exact mutations.

Looking at the introduction, it discusses PD's pathology but doesn't mention any specific mutations. The focus is on the role of PINK1 in the disease mechanism rather than specific mutations.

Since the task is to extract mutation details, but the provided text doesn't specify any particular cDNA or protein changes, the correct approach is to note that the gene is PINK1 and that clinical mutations are involved. However, for the cDNA and protein changes, since they aren't detailed, we should mark them as "N.D." as per the constraints. The description would be "clinical mutations" as that's what's mentioned in the text.

I need to ensure that the JSON structure is correctly filled out with "N.D." where specific information is missing. The example given uses "N.D." for transcript and other unspecified fields, so following that, the transcript, ref, alt, and position for cDNA and protein would be "N.D." since they aren't provided in the literature excerpt.
