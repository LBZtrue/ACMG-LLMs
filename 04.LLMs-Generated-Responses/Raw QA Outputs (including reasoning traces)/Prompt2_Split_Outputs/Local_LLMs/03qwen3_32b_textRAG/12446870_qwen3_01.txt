Okay, let's start by reading the provided abstract carefully. The user is asking if there's any mutation information mentioned here. My job is to check for terms related to mutations, such as gene names, specific DNA changes, protein alterations, etc.

Looking at the abstract, the main focus is on Deinococcus radiodurans and its DNA repair mechanisms, particularly the role of DNA toroids and the effect of Mn²+ ions. There's mention of recA-deficient mutants. The term "recA-deficient" stands out here. In genetics, when a gene is described as "deficient," it usually means a mutation that knocks out the gene's function. So "recA-deficient D. radiodurans mutants" implies that the recA gene is mutated in these mutants. 

I need to confirm if this is a mutation. Yes, "recA-deficient" suggests a loss-of-function mutation in the recA gene. The abstract states that these mutants can perform the RecA-independent repair phase but not the RecA-dependent one. So the mutation in recA is causing the deficiency. 

Now, extracting the relevant details. The gene is "recA". The variant would be a mutation leading to a deficiency. However, the abstract doesn't specify the exact DNA change (like cDNA or protein changes) but just mentions the deficiency. So for cDNA and protein changes, I should put "N.D." as those details aren't provided. The description in context would be "recA-deficient D. radiodurans mutants". 

I need to make sure there are no other mutations mentioned. The rest of the abstract discusses DNA toroids, Mn²+ effects, and repair phases without mentioning other genes or mutations. So the only mutation-related info is the recA-deficient mutants. 

Therefore, the JSON should include the gene "recA", the variant description, and note that specific cDNA and protein changes are not detailed.
