Okay, let's look at the provided text. The user wants to extract mutation-related information. The first paragraph mentions alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation in Parkinson's disease and specifically points out the pathogenetic point mutation A30P. Then there's a mention of a triplication of the α-syn gene linked to early-onset familial PD. 

The A30P mutation is a clear example here. The gene in question is α-synuclein, which is often abbreviated as SNCA. The mutation A30P refers to the protein change where Alanine at position 30 is replaced by Proline. 

Looking at the cDNA change, the text doesn't specify the exact nucleotide change, so that would be "N.D." The transcript version isn't mentioned either. The protein change is explicitly stated as A30P. The description in the context is "A30P" as a point mutation. 

The triplication of the gene is mentioned but it's not a mutation in the sense of a point mutation or a substitution. Since the user's example focuses on mutations like c.248G>A (p.G83D), the triplication might be a different type of genetic alteration. However, the question is about mutations, and triplication is a copy number variation. The example given in the workflow doesn't include copy number variations, so I should focus on the A30P point mutation.

So, the gene is SNCA. The variant has a cDNA change with N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, and position. The protein change is A (Alanine) at position 30 to P (Proline). The description is "A30P" as a pathogenetic point mutation. The triplication is noted but since it's not a mutation in the required format, it's left out. 

Therefore, the JSON should include SNCA with the A30P mutation details.
