Okay, let me start by carefully reading the provided text to identify any mention of mutations. The user is specifically interested in extracting mutation-related information, so I need to look for terms like gene names, specific mutations in cDNA or protein, and any descriptions of these mutations.

In the first paragraph, I see the mention of "wild type or mutant α-synuclein." The term "mutant" here refers to a mutation in the α-synuclein gene. However, the text doesn't specify the exact gene name beyond the protein (α-synuclein), so I'll need to note that. The gene associated with α-synuclein is SNCA. 

The text also states that the presence of mutant α-synuclein exacerbates Fe²⁺-mediated toxicity. However, there's no specific information about the cDNA changes, protein changes, or the exact mutation description. The example provided in the user's prompt includes details like cDNA change (e.g., c.248G>A) and protein change (p.G83D), but in this case, the literature only mentions the presence of mutant α-synuclein without specifying the exact mutations. 

Since the user's constraints require extracting only directly mentioned information and using "N.D." for missing parts, I need to structure the JSON accordingly. The gene here is SNCA, but the variants section will have "N.D." for cDNA and protein changes because they aren't specified. The description in the context would be the mention of mutant α-synuclein. 

I should check if there's any other part of the text that might have more details. The second paragraph talks about oxidative stress and the Fenton reaction but doesn't mention specific mutations. Therefore, the only mutation-related information is the reference to mutant α-synuclein without specific variants. 

So, the final JSON should include the gene as SNCA, and under variants, the cDNA and protein changes will be "N.D.", with the description being the context provided in the text.
