Okay, let's start by reading through the provided abstract and introduction to identify any mention of mutations related to the Parkin gene. The user's goal is to extract mutation information if present.

In the abstract, the first sentence mentions that Parkin is involved in Parkinson's disease and that mutations in the parkin gene are linked to autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism. The key sentence here is: "Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism... is directly linked to mutations in the parkin gene." However, it doesn't specify any particular mutations, like cDNA changes, protein changes, or specific variant descriptions. 

Looking further in the abstract, it discusses pathogenic Parkin mutations disrupting autoinhibition but doesn't provide specific mutation details. The introduction talks about E3 ligases and their regulation but doesn't mention mutations either.

The example given in the query includes specific mutations like c.248G>A, which are detailed. However, in the provided text, there's no such specific information. The literature mentions mutations in the parkin gene in the context of causing the disease but doesn't list any specific variants. 

Therefore, while the text does mention that mutations in the parkin gene are associated with the disease, it doesn't provide the cDNA changes, protein changes, or detailed variant descriptions. The user's constraints require extracting only what's explicitly stated. Since specific mutation details aren't provided, the correct response is to note that the information isn't mentioned and return "N.D." for those fields.
