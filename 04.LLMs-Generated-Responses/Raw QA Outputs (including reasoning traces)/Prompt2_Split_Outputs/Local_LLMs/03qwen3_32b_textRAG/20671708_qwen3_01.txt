Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information from the abstract. The main focus here is on LRRK2 mutations causing Parkinson's disease.

First, I need to identify any mention of specific mutations. The abstract mentions "gain-of-function mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)" which causes PD. Then, later on, it refers to "pathogenic LRRK2" and specifically names two mutations: dLRRK(I1915T) and hLRRK2(G2019S). 

Looking at the first mutation, dLRRK(I1915T), this is in Drosophila LRRK2. The notation I1915T means the 1915th amino acid is isoleucine (I) and it's mutated to threonine (T). The second mutation is hLRRK2(G2019S), which is in human LRRK2, where glutamate (G) at position 2019 is replaced by serine (S). 

I need to map these to the JSON structure. The gene is LRRK2 in both cases. For the cDNA changes, the text doesn't specify the transcript ID, so that's N.D. The positions and ref/alt amino acids are given. The descriptions in the context are the mutation notations as mentioned. 

I should make sure there are no other mutations mentioned. The rest of the text talks about other genes like e2f1 and dp, but those are targets of miRNAs, not mutations. The Dicer knockout mice are mentioned, but that's a different gene and not a mutation in the context of the question. 

So, the two mutations are the key here. Each should be a separate variant in the JSON array. All required fields are present, so no N.D. except where applicable. The output should include both mutations with their details.
