Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to check if there are any mutations mentioned.

Looking at the abstract and introduction, the main focus is on PINK1 gene mutations causing Parkinson's disease. The abstract mentions specific mutations: G309D, L347P, and W437X. These are PD-linked mutations in PINK1. 

Now, I need to map these mutations to the required JSON format. The gene is PINK1. Each variant has a cDNA change and a protein change. However, the text doesn't provide cDNA changes (like c. notation), so those fields should be N.D. The protein changes are given as G309D, L347P, and W437X. 

For each variant, I need to extract the amino acid change and position. For example, G309D means glycine at position 309 becomes aspartic acid. Similarly for the others. The description in the context is "PINK1 G309D, L347P, and W437X mutations".

So, the JSON should list each variant with the gene, variants array containing each mutation's details. Since cDNA changes aren't provided, those are N.D. The protein changes have the ref (original amino acid), alt (mutated), and position. The description is as mentioned in the text.
