Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user is asking me to determine if there's any mutation information present and extract the relevant details.

First, the abstract mentions that mutations in PARK2 cause AR-JP. The gene is clearly PARK2. Then, it says that mutant parkins from AR-JP patients show loss of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. However, the text doesn't specify any particular cDNA or protein changes. There's a mention of "mutant parkins," which implies that there are mutations, but the exact variants aren't described here. The examples given in the workflow include specific mutations like c.248G>A (p.G83D), but in this case, the literature only states that mutations exist without providing details on the specific nucleotide or amino acid changes. 

So, I need to check if there are any cDNA changes (like positions, ref/alt bases) or protein changes (positions, ref/alt amino acids). The text doesn't provide any of these specifics. Therefore, for the variants array, each required field (cDNA Change and Protein Change) would need to be filled with "N.D." as per the constraints. The description in the input context would be the part where it mentions "mutant parkins from AR-JP patients show loss of the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity."

I should structure the JSON accordingly, making sure that all fields are present and that missing information is replaced with "N.D." to maintain the format. The key here is that while mutations are discussed, the specific variants aren't detailed, so the extraction stops at the gene level with the general description.
