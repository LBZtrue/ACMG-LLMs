Okay, let's start by reading through the provided context to see if there's any mutation information. The abstract mentions that mutations in PINK1 cause an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's disease, PARK6. So that's a gene involved here.

Looking at the introduction, it talks about PD and mitochondrial dysfunction but doesn't specify any particular mutations in terms of cDNA or protein changes. The abstract does mention that PARK6-related mutations don't affect dimerization but doesn't provide specific mutation details like c. notation or amino acid changes. 

The question is about extracting mutation details if present. The example given in the user's prompt includes specific cDNA and protein changes, but in the provided text, there's no such detailed information. The text refers to mutations in PINK1 leading to PD, but without specifying the exact variants. 

So, the gene is PINK1, but there's no cDNA change or protein change details provided. The description is general, just stating that mutations in PINK1 cause the disease. Therefore, the variants section would have "N.D." for the missing fields. The user's constraints require using "N.D." where information isn't mentioned. 

I need to make sure that the JSON structure is followed. The gene is PINK1, and under variants, each field that isn't specified should be "N.D." So the cDNA Change and Protein Change will all have "N.D." since the specific mutations aren't described in the text. The description in the input context would be "Mutations in PINK1 cause an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's disease (PARK6)".
