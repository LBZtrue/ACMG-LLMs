Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user is asking to extract mutation information from the given paragraph. My first step is to look for any mention of mutations, gene names, or specific changes.

Looking at the paragraph, there's a section that says: "Strong genetic and experimental data have linked several autosomal dominant parkinsonian syndromes to three human mutations in the gene encoding for a-synuclein (Polymeropoulos et al. 1997): A53T and A30P point mutations in a German kindred, and an E46K mutation in a Spanish family (Kruger et al. 1998)." 

So here, three mutations are mentioned. The gene involved is a-synuclein. The mutations are A53T, A30P, and E46K. These are protein changes where the amino acid at a specific position is altered. For example, A53T means Alanine at position 53 is changed to Threonine. 

Next, I need to structure this into the required JSON format. The gene is "a-synuclein". For each variant, I need to note the cDNA change and protein change. However, the text here only mentions the protein changes (A53T, A30P, E46K) and doesn't provide cDNA changes (like c. positions). So for cDNA changes, I'll have to put "N.D." for not mentioned. 

Each mutation is a separate variant. The description in the context is the mutation name as given in the text. Since there's no transcript information provided for cDNA changes, those fields will be "N.D." as well. 

I should check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The rest of the paragraph talks about heme oxygenase enzymes but doesn't mention other mutations. So only the three listed are relevant here. 

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the gene name and three variants with the respective protein changes and descriptions. All cDNA fields will be "N.D." as they aren't specified in the text.
