Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants to know if there's any mutation information here. The abstract mentions "three ␣S point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism." So, there are mutations in the α-synuclein (αS) gene.

The main gene here is α-synuclein, which is often denoted as SNCA in gene nomenclature. The text refers to three PD-linked mutations but doesn't specify the exact cDNA or protein changes. The example given in the user's instructions shows that if specific mutations are mentioned, they should be extracted. However, in this case, the mutations are only described generally without the specific nucleotide or amino acid changes. 

I need to check if the text provides any cDNA or protein changes. The abstract states there are three point mutations but doesn't list them. The known mutations in SNCA associated with Parkinson's disease are A53T, A30P, and E46K. However, the user's instruction says to extract only information directly mentioned. Since the text doesn't specify these, I can't include them unless they are explicitly stated here. 

The text does mention the gene (αS) and that there are three point mutations, but without the exact positions or changes. Therefore, for the cDNA and protein changes, we have to put "N.D." because they aren't provided. The description in the context would be "three ␣S point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism." 

So the JSON structure should include the gene as SNCA (since α-synuclein is SNCA), and under variants, each variant entry will have "N.D." for cDNA and protein changes, with the description provided.
