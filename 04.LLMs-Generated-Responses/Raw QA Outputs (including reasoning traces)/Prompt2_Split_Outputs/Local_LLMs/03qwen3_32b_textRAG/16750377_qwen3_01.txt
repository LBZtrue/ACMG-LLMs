Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information from the provided text. First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations. 

Looking at the abstract and introduction, the main focus is on the LRRK2 gene and its mutations causing Parkinson's disease. The abstract mentions that mutations are found throughout the gene, including the kinase domain. The introduction also talks about dominant mutations in LRRK2.

Now, I need to extract specific details. The gene is clearly LRRK2. The text refers to "pathogenic mutations" and "mutant dardarin," but it doesn't specify particular variants like c. or p. changes. The examples given in the user's prompt include specific cDNA and protein changes, but in this case, the literature doesn't provide those exact terms. 

The user's example shows that if the information isn't present, I should use "N.D." So, for cDNA Change and Protein Change, since there are no specific nucleotide or amino acid positions mentioned, I'll put N.D. in those fields. The mutation description in the context is "pathogenic mutations" and mentions the kinase domain, but again, no specific variants. So the description would be "pathogenic mutations" and "mutant dardarin."

Putting this all together, the JSON should have the gene as LRRK2 and the variants array with the appropriate N.D. entries and the descriptions found. I need to make sure not to include any fabricated data and strictly use what's in the text.
