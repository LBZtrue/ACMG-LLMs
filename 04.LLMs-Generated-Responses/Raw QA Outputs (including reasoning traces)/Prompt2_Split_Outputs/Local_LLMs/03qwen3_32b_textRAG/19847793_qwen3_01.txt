Okay, let's start by reading through the provided abstract carefully. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information if it exists in the text. 

First, I need to check if there are any mentions of mutations. The abstract starts by stating that mutations in the PINK1 gene are associated with Parkinson's disease. So, that's a clear mention of mutations.

Next, the study created cell lines with normal and mutant PINK1 to simulate heterozygous and homozygous states. The methods section mentions generating mutants in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain. However, specific cDNA or protein changes aren't detailed here. The focus is on the regions of the gene affected, like the kinase domain, but there are no specific nucleotide or amino acid changes provided.

The results discuss the effects of these mutants, such as increased apoptosis and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. But again, the exact mutations aren't specified beyond the regions (N-terminus, C-terminus, kinase domain). There's no mention of specific cDNA changes like c.123A>T or protein changes like p.Arg45Gly. 

Since the abstract doesn't provide specific mutation details beyond the affected regions and the fact that mutants were used, the required fields for cDNA and protein changes would be N.D. The gene is clearly PINK1, and the variants are described in terms of their locations and effects, but without specific nucleotide or amino acid substitutions. 

I need to structure the JSON accordingly, listing the gene as PINK1 and the variants with the regions as the description. Since there's no specific cDNA or protein change information, those fields will be N.D. The description in the context would mention the regions (N-terminus, C-terminus, kinase domain mutants).
