Okay, let's start by reading through the provided abstract carefully. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information if present. The abstract discusses parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and mentions two specific mutations: K48A and R42P. 

First, I need to identify the gene involved. The text refers to "parkin," which is the gene name, so that's straightforward. 

Next, looking for cDNA changes. The mutations are described as K48A and R42P. These are protein-level changes, not cDNA. The abstract doesn't mention any specific cDNA changes like nucleotide positions or transcripts. So for cDNA Change, I should note "N.D." since it's not provided.

For the protein changes, K48A means lysine at position 48 is replaced by alanine, and R42P is arginine at position 42 replaced by proline. The descriptions in the context are given as "K48A mutation" and "R42P mutation." 

I need to structure this into the JSON format. Each variant should be an object in the variants array. The cDNA Change will have "N.D." for transcript, ref, alt, and position. The Protein Change will include the amino acid changes and positions. The Description in input context will be the mutation names as mentioned.

I should double-check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The abstract only discusses these two, so no more variants to extract. Making sure all fields are filled correctly, using "N.D." where information isn't present. Everything looks good. Time to format the JSON accordingly.
