Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user is asking to extract mutation-related information from the given paragraphs. First, I need to check if there's any mention of mutations in the context.

Looking at the abstract and introduction, the first paragraph mentions that "Mutations in PINK1 were shown to cause recessive familial PD." So right there, we know the gene involved is PINK1. The next part talks about the structure of the PINK1 gene and protein but doesn't specify any particular mutations. The introduction also discusses PINK1's structure and localization but again, no specific mutations are listed. 

The question is specifically about extracting mutations. The text does state that mutations in PINK1 are associated with PD, but it doesn't provide any specific cDNA changes, protein changes, or detailed descriptions of the mutations beyond mentioning that some PD-related mutations have been modeled. For example, the sentence "some evidences that help to explain the effect of some PD-related mutations in this protein's function" indicates that mutations exist but doesn't specify which ones.

Since there are no concrete examples of mutations like c.248G>A or p.G83D as in the example, the variants section would need to be filled with "N.D." for not mentioned. The gene is definitely PINK1, but without specific details on the cDNA or protein changes, those fields remain N.D. The description in the input context is the general mention of mutations in PINK1 causing PD.

So the final JSON should list the gene as PINK1 and the variants with all their subfields as N.D. because the text doesn't provide specific mutation details beyond the gene name and their association with PD.
