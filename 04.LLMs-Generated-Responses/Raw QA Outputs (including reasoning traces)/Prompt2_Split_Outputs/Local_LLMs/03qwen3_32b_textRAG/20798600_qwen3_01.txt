Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text to identify any mentions of mutations. The user is looking for information related to mutations in the context of Parkinson's disease genes, specifically PINK1 and Parkin.

First, the abstract mentions PD-associated genes PINK1 and Parkin. It states that PD-associated Parkin mutations interfere with mitophagy. Then, it says that PD-linked PINK1 mutations compromise the selective degradation of mitochondria. The text also notes that PD-associated Parkin mutations interfere with mitophagy at distinct steps and that PD-linked PINK1 mutations abrogate autophagy. 

Looking for specific mutation details: the text refers to "disease-associated PINK1 mutations" and "PD-associated Parkin mutations," but there are no specific cDNA or protein changes provided, like c.248G>A or p.G83D. The descriptions are general, mentioning that these mutations affect their functions (e.g., decreased physical binding activity of PINK1 mutations to Parkin). 

Since the examples require specific cDNA and protein changes, and the text here doesn't include those, I need to extract what's available. The gene names are PINK1 and Parkin. The variants are described as "disease-associated" and "PD-associated," but without specific nucleotide or amino acid changes. The descriptions in the context mention interference with mitophagy and decreased binding activity. 

So, for each gene, I'll note the gene name, and under variants, each mutation will have "N.D." for cDNA and protein changes since they aren't specified. The descriptions will be the phrases from the text that describe how the mutations affect function. 

I need to structure this into the JSON format as per the example. Each variant entry under "variants" will have cDNA Change and Protein Change with "N.D." where details are missing, and the description will be the relevant sentence from the text. 

Double-checking to ensure no specific mutations are missed. The text does mention "mutations" but doesn't provide the exact changes. Therefore, the answer should include the gene names and the general descriptions without specific variant details.
