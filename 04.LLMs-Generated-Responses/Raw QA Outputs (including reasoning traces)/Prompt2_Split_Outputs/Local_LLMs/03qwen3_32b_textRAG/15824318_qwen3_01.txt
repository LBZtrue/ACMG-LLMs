Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants to extract mutation information from the literature. The context is about PINK1 gene mutations related to Parkinson's disease.

First, I need to check if there are any mutations mentioned. The abstract mentions two point mutations: G309D and L347P. These are protein changes where the amino acid at position 309 changes from Glycine (G) to Aspartic acid (D), and at position 347, Leucine (L) becomes Proline (P). 

Looking for gene names, the main one here is PINK1. Now, checking for cDNA changes. The text doesn't specify any cDNA changes, like nucleotide positions or transcript versions. The examples provided use "N.D." when information is missing, so I'll apply that here.

Protein changes are clearly G309D and L347P. The description in the context for these mutations is given as "G309D" and "L347P", which matches the format. 

I should structure the JSON with the gene as PINK1 and the variants array containing each mutation. Each variant will have cDNA change as N.D., protein change with the respective positions and amino acids, and the description as per the text. 

Wait, the example shows "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", which includes both cDNA and protein changes. Here, the text only mentions the protein changes, not the cDNA. So for cDNA Change, I'll use "N.D." for both. 

Also, the user's example uses "N.D." for missing parts. So the final JSON should have Gene as "PINK1", and under variants, two entries for each mutation with the appropriate details. 

I need to make sure that the JSON structure is correct, with the right keys and that all required fields are present. The "transcript" in cDNA Change is "N.D." since it's not mentioned. 

Yes, that should cover all the necessary information from the text provided. No other mutations are mentioned, so only these two variants are included.
