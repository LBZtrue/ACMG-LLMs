Okay, let's start by reading through the provided context and introduction to identify any mentions of mutations in the DJ-1 gene. The user wants me to extract specific mutation details if present.

First, the abstract mentions that mutations in the DJ-1 gene are associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease. It specifically talks about the L166P and M26I point mutations. The L166P mutation destabilizes the protein, leading to gene knockout. The M26I mutation is also unstable but less so. The R98Q variant is noted as stable. 

Looking at the structure of the answer required, I need to list each variant with their cDNA and protein changes. However, the provided text doesn't mention cDNA changes like c.248G>A in the example. Instead, it refers to protein changes directly (e.g., L166P, M26I, R98Q). 

Since the user's example includes both cDNA and protein changes, but the current text only provides protein changes, I should note the cDNA change as "N.D." for not described. The protein changes are straightforward: for each mutation, the position and amino acid change are given. 

I need to ensure that each variant is correctly formatted. The description in the context should reflect how the mutation is mentioned. For example, "L166P" is described as destabilizing the protein, and "M26I" is unstable but less so. The R98Q is stable. 

I'll structure the JSON with the gene as "DJ-1" and each variant entry with their respective protein changes, setting cDNA change to "N.D." since the transcript details aren't provided. The descriptions will be based on the text's explanations of each mutation's effect.
