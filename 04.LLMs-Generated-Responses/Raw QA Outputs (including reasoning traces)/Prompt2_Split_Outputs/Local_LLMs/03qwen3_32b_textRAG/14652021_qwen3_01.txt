Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to extract mutation-related information. 

The abstract mentions DJ-1 gene mutations linked to AR-EOP. There's a specific mutation mentioned: L166P. That's a protein change where leucine at position 166 is replaced with proline. 

Looking at the first paragraph, the text says "L166P mutant DJ-1" and mentions that over-expression of wild-type DJ-1 rescues cell death but not the mutant. So the gene is DJ-1, and the variant is L166P. 

In the second paragraph, it talks about Parkin gene (PARK2) mutations in AR-JP. The DJ-1 is another causative gene (PARK7). The mutations in DJ-1 include a large deletion, leading to loss of protein or function. The L166P mutation is specifically noted. 

So, the gene is DJ-1 (PARK7). The variant is L166P. The cDNA change isn't provided, so I'll put N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, and position if missing. The protein change is ref: L, alt: P, position: 166. The description in the context is "L166P mutant DJ-1". 

I need to make sure there are no other mutations mentioned. The text also refers to a large deletion in DJ-1, but since it's not specified, I can't extract details. The example given in the user's prompt only included the L166P mutation, so I'll focus on that. 

So the JSON should have Gene as DJ-1 (PARK7), variants with cDNA as N.D. and protein change as L166P. The description is "L166P mutant DJ-1". 

I should check if there are other genes. The Parkin gene (PARK2) is mentioned, but the user's example didn't include that. The query is about mutations in the given text, so if the user is focusing on DJ-1, then that's the main gene here. 

Therefore, the final answer should include DJ-1 with the L166P variant.
