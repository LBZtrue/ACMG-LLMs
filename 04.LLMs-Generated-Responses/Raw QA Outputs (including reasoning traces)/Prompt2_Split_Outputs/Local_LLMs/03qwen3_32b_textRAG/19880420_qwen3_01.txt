Okay, let's start by carefully reading the provided text. The user wants me to check if there's any mutation information mentioned in the abstract and introduction.

Looking at the abstract first, the first sentence mentions mutations in PINK1 or parkin causing autosomal recessive PD. It also states that PD-linked pathogenic PINK1 mutations impair the ability of PINK1. Then in the introduction, it says homozygous mutations in parkin and PINK1 are causes of early-onset PD, and heterozygous mutations in these genes are risk factors for late-onset PD. However, specific mutations like c.248G>A (p.G83D) in the example are not present here. The text refers to mutations in general terms without specifying the exact cDNA or protein changes. 

The example given in the user's query had specific variants, but in this case, the literature only talks about mutations in PINK1 and parkin leading to PD, without detailing the exact nucleotide or amino acid changes. The terms used are "mutations" in general, not specific variants. So, according to the constraints, if the specific cDNA or protein changes aren't mentioned, those fields should be filled with "N.D.".

Therefore, the gene names are PINK1 and parkin. The variants would be listed, but since there are no specific cDNA or protein changes provided, those fields get "N.D." The description in the input context would be the general mention of mutations causing PD. So the JSON structure should include "PINK1" and "parkin" as the genes, each with their respective variants entries where the specific details are not present.
