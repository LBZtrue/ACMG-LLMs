Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from this given medical literature paragraph. The user has provided a specific JSON format they want the answer in, and if there's no relevant info, I should use "N.D.".

Looking at the input text, the first part mentions that DJ-1 deletion and point mutations (specifically L166P) are responsible for familial Parkinson’s disease. That seems important. The study talks about how these mutations make cells susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cell death because DJ-1 normally helps eliminate hydrogen peroxide by oxidizing itself.

So, I can see that the gene involved is DJ-1. Now, the mutation mentioned is L166P. Since it's a point mutation, the cDNA change would be at position 166. But the paragraph doesn't specify what the exact nucleotide change is—like from which base to which. It only mentions the protein change (Leu to Pro). Therefore, in the JSON, I should note that for cDNA Change, the transcript and ref/alt bases are N.D., but include the position.

The protein change is clear: L166P, so Leucine at position 166 changing to Proline. The description from the input context would be "L166P" mutation.

I should structure this into the JSON format as specified. Under "variants", each variant should have cDNA and protein changes with their respective details. Since the cDNA ref, alt, and transcript aren't given, I'll set them to N.D. while noting the position is 166 for both.

Also, the description in context is directly from the input, so that's "L166P" mutation of DJ-1 responsible for familial PD.

I think that covers all required fields without making any assumptions beyond what's provided.
