Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraph. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The article is about LRRK2 and its role in Parkinson's disease. The abstract mentions that the I2020T mutant has higher susceptibility to degradation and impaired protective effects against apoptosis compared to wild-type LRRK2. This suggests a mutation causing a functional change.

In the introduction, it's stated that the Sagamihara family patients have the I2020T mutation in the kinase domain of LRRK2. So, this is definitely a mutation related to Parkinson’s disease.

I need to identify specific elements: gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions from the context.

The gene here is clearly LRRK2. The mutation mentioned is I2020T, which refers to an isoleucine (I) changing to threonine (T) at position 2020 in the kinase domain.

Looking for cDNA details, the text doesn't provide specific nucleotide changes or transcript information—it only mentions the protein change. Similarly, there's no detailed description of the mutation beyond its location and effect on degradation and apoptosis.

So, I'll structure the JSON with Gene as LRRK2, add a variant object. The cDNA section will have N.D., and the Protein Change will be I2020T at position 2020. The context description will include this mutation and its effects as stated in the text.

I need to make sure no fields are omitted and everything is accurate based on what's given.
