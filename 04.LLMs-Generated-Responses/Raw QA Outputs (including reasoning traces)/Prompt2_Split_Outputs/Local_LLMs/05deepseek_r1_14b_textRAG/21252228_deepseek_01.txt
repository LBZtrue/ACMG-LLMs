Okay, I need to figure out how to extract mutation-related information from the provided literature paragraph. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The first sentence mentions "mutant A53T -Synuclein." That definitely sounds like a mutation. The term 'mutant' clearly indicates a genetic alteration here. 

Now, breaking down "A53T," I recognize that this follows the standard nomenclature for mutations: the amino acid at position 53 has changed from alanine (A) to threonine (T). So, in terms of gene and protein changes, we're looking at a point mutation.

Looking into the text further, there's no mention of the specific cDNA change. The focus is more on the protein level—how the mutant -Synuclein affects neuronal death by increasing mitochondrial autophagy. Therefore, the cDNA change remains unspecified in this context.

The literature doesn't provide any other mutations beyond A53T. It primarily discusses the effects of this specific mutation rather than other possible variants or additional genetic changes.

Putting it all together, the key mutation is A53T in the -Synuclein gene (SNCA). The description given in the context directly references this mutation as causing neuronal death through mitochondrial issues.
