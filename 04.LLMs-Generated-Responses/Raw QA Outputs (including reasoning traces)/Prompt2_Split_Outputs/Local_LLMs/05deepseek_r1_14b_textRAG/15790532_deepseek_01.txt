Alright, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given paragraph about DJ-1 gene mutations and their effects on protein stability and subcellular localization. 

First, I'll read through the paragraph carefully to identify any mutation-related terms. The abstract mentions "mutations in the DJ-1 gene," which immediately signals that there's relevant info here.

Looking further, specific mutations are listed: L166P, M26I, R98Q. These are point mutations, so I should note each one with their cDNA and protein changes. 

For L166P, the original study says it destabilizes the protein, effectively causing a knockout. So I'll include this effect in the description.

M26I is mentioned as being unstable but less dramatic than L166P. It also notes that proteasome inhibition partially rescues the protein levels. Additionally, M26 retains dimerization ability, which is an important functional aspect. This info should be included in its description.

R98Q is described as generally stable, indicating a different effect compared to the other mutations. I'll make sure to highlight this stability in its entry.

I don't see any other mutations mentioned beyond these three. The paragraph doesn't provide further details on each mutation's exact cDNA or protein changes except what's listed, so for any missing info like transcript or position specifics, I'll use "N.D."

Subcellular localization is discussed too, noting that under oxidative conditions, DJ-1 tends to localize in mitochondria more. However, this isn't directly about mutations but their effects, so it might be included in the descriptions if applicable.

I need to structure all this into a JSON format as specified, ensuring each mutation has its own entry with cDNA and protein changes, along with a brief description from the context.
