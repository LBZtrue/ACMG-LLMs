Okay, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions mutations in α-synuclein such as E46K, A30P, and A53T. These are known missense mutations associated with Lewy body diseases like Parkinson's disease. The introduction also references studies where these mutations were found to cause familial cases of PD and DLB.

Looking at the variants section in the example, it shows how to structure the information. Each variant has cDNA and protein changes. In the provided text, E46K is an amino acid change from Glu (E) to Lys (K) at position 46. Similarly, A30P changes Ala (A) to Pro (P) at position 30, and A53T changes Ala (A) to Thr (T) at position 53.

The literature doesn't provide the specific cDNA positions for these mutations, only the amino acid substitutions. So in each variant, the transcript will be marked as N.D., while the protein change is explicitly stated.

I should include all three mutations listed: E46K, A30P, and A53T. Each will have their respective protein changes but no cDNA information available from the text.

Finally, I'll structure this into JSON format, ensuring that each mutation has its gene (α-synuclein) and the relevant variant details.
