Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph about Parkinson’s disease. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, I notice that the abstract and introduction sections mention UCH-L1 and a-synuclein mutations in relation to Parkinson’s disease. The abstract specifically talks about D30K and C90S mutants of UCH-L1, as well as the I93M mutation. Also, it mentions that Parkinson's disease-linked a-synuclein mutants reduce the secretion of endogenous UCH-L1.

I need to extract gene names, their variants (cDNA changes), protein changes, and any descriptions related to these mutations. Let me identify each mutation mentioned:

1. D30K in UCH-L1: This is an aspartic acid to lysine change at position 30.
2. C90S in UCH-L1: This is a cysteine to serine change at position 90.
3. I93M in UCH-L1: This is an isoleucine to methionine change at position 93.

Additionally, the text refers to Parkinson’s disease-associated mutations in a-synuclein. However, it doesn't specify the exact mutations (like which amino acids are changed), only that they are linked to PD and affect UCH-L1 secretion.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format. For each mutation, I'll include the gene name, cDNA changes if available, protein changes, and a brief description from the text context.

For the a-synuclein mutants, since no specific variants are mentioned, I'll note it as "N.D." where necessary.

Let me make sure that all fields are included, even if they're not specified. For example, transcript information is often part of cDNA changes but isn't provided here, so I'll mark those as "N.D."

I think that's all the mutation-related info in the text. Now, I'll format this into JSON.
