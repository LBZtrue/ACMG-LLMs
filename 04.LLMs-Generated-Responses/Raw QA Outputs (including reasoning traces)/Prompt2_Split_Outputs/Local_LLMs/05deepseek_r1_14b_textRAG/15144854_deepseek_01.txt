Alright, let's tackle this query. The user is asking me to act as a professional medical literature data mining expert. My role is to extract mutation-related information from the provided text and structure it in JSON format.

First, I'll read through the given context carefully. It's an abstract about a study on familial Parkinson’s disease caused by the A53T alpha-synuclein mutation. The key points here are that they're discussing a specific mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene (a-syn) at position A53T.

I need to identify if there are any mutations mentioned. Scanning through, I see "A53T a-synuclein mutation." That's definitely a mutation. Now, let's break it down: the gene is alpha-synuclein, and the variant is A53T. 

Looking for cDNA changes: The text doesn't provide specific nucleotide positions or codon numbers, just mentions the amino acid change from alanine to threonine at position 53. So, for cDNA, it's N.D. because there's no transcript information given.

For protein changes, we have the substitution of A (alanine) to T (threonine) at position 53. The description in context is "A53T a-synuclein mutation." 

The effect described is that this mutation causes familial Parkinson’s disease and affects tau fibrillization as well.

So, putting it all together, the JSON should include the gene name, the variants with their respective changes, and descriptions as per the input. Since cDNA info isn't provided, I'll mark those fields as N.D.
