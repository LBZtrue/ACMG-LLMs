Alright, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation-related information from this given medical literature paragraph. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

The abstract mentions that genetic alterations in the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene are implicated in Parkinson Disease. It lists these alterations as point mutations, gene multiplications, and sequence variations within the promoter. Then it specifically talks about a patient heterozygous for p.Ala53Thr, which is the first mutation linked to PD pathogenesis.

In the introduction, they again refer to this p.Ala53Thr mutation being implicated in PD. The key here is identifying if there's specific mutation information beyond just mentions of mutations existing. The terms used are "p.Ala53Thr" and possibly SNCA gene alterations.

Now, looking at what needs to be extracted: Gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and their descriptions. From the text, the gene is clearly alpha-synuclein (SNCA). The mutation mentioned is p.Ala53Thr, which refers to a missense mutation where alanine at position 53 is changed to threonine in the protein.

However, the cDNA change isn't explicitly provided. The literature mentions the protein-level change but doesn't specify the exact nucleotide alteration. So for cDNA changes, all fields would be N.D. since they aren't mentioned. Similarly, the description field needs only what's present; "p.Ala53Thr" is sufficient.

So putting it together: Gene is SNCA, variants have the protein change p.Ala53Thr, but no cDNA info or additional descriptions are provided in the text.
