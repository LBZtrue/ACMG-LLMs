Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the provided literature abstract. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The abstract mentions that mutations of parkin account for most autosomal recessive forms of juvenile Parkinson’s disease (AR-JP). It talks about parkin's role as a p53 transcriptional repressor and the effects of these mutations on its function.

Looking for specific mutation details, I see terms like "pathogenic mutations" and that some mutations either abolish or preserve ligase activity. However, it doesn't provide the actual cDNA changes or protein alterations caused by these mutations. It refers to them as familial missense mutations but without specifics.

So, from this, I can extract that the gene involved is parkin, and there are pathogenic mutations associated with AR-JP. But there's no detailed information on the exact cDNA or protein changes. Therefore, those fields will be marked as "N.D." since the data isn't provided in the text.
