Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to act as an expert in medical literature data mining, specifically looking for mutation information. They provided a sample paragraph from a study on somatic mutations of the PARK2 gene in glioblastoma and other cancers.

First, I need to identify whether there are any mutations mentioned. Scanning through the abstract, I see that it's about mutations in the PARK2 gene associated with Parkinson's disease. The key here is to find specific details about these mutations.

I notice mentions of "somatic mutations," which indicates that mutations were indeed studied. However, the paragraph doesn't provide specifics like cDNA or protein changes. It talks about the association but not the exact variants involved. There are no details on how the mutations affect the gene or protein structure.

So, I should extract the gene name, PARK2, and note that mutation information is present but without specific details. In the JSON response, I'll list the gene and indicate that while there's a mention of mutations, the exact cDNA and protein changes aren't provided, hence "N.D." for those fields.

I must ensure that the output adheres strictly to the user's format requirements, including all necessary fields even if some are not applicable. This way, the response is both accurate and comprehensive as per their constraints.
