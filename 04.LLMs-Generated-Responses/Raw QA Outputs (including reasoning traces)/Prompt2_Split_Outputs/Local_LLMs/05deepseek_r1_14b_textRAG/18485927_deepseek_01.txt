Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is looking to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. They want me to identify if there are any mutations mentioned and then pull out specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

First, I'll read the provided abstract carefully. It's about the crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulation of the ubiquitin-like domain (Uld) of murine parkin. The article mentions that they studied wild-type Uld and five mutants: K27N, R33Q, R42P, K48A, and V56E. These mutants are identified from AR-JP patients.

So, the mutations listed are:
1. K27N
2. R33Q
3. R42P
4. K48A
5. V56E

I need to extract each mutation's details. Since the abstract doesn't provide cDNA or protein position information, I'll note that as "N.D." for those fields. However, the variants and their effects are described in the context of structural changes observed in MD simulations.

Each mutation affects different parts of the Uld structure. For example, K27N increases structural fluctuations in beta strands, while V56E restricts spatial flexibility at the periphery of alpha2 helix.

Putting this together, I'll structure the JSON with each variant having their respective changes and a brief description from the context.
