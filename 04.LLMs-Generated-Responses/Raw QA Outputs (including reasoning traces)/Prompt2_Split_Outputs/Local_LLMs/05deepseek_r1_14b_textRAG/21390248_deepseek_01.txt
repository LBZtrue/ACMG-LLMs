Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation-related information from the given paragraph about LRRK2 and familial Parkinson's disease. Let me start by reading through the paragraph carefully.

The paragraph mentions that common mutations in LRRK2 are causes of both inherited and some sporadic forms of Parkinson’s disease. It lists three specific mutations: R1441G, Y1699C, and G2019S. These are all point mutations, I think. The paragraph explains that these mutations impair 14-3-3 binding to LRRK2 by reducing the phosphorylation levels at site S935.

I need to extract the gene name, variants, their cDNA and protein changes, and any descriptions from the context. 

Looking at each mutation:
1. R1441G: This is an arginine to glycine change. In terms of cDNA, I think it would be something like c.1441R>G, but the exact position isn't specified here.
2. Y1699C: Tyrosine to cysteine. Similarly, this would be c.1699Y>C, again without the exact position number in the text.
3. G2019S: Glycine to serine at position 2019.

The paragraph doesn't specify the transcript version or the exact cDNA positions beyond the amino acid changes. So I'll note that as "N.D." for those fields.

I should structure the JSON accordingly, listing each variant with their respective cDNA and protein changes, along with the description from the input text.
