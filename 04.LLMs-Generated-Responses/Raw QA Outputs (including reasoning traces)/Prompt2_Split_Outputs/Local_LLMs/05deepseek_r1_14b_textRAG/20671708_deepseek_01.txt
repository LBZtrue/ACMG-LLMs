Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given paragraph. Let me read through it carefully.

The abstract starts by talking about gain-of-function mutations in LRRK2 causing Parkinson's disease. So that's a clear indicator of mutation involvement. The gene mentioned is LRRK2, and the specific mutations are I1915T and G2019S. 

I remember that in medical literature, when they mention specific letters like I1915T or G2019S, these usually refer to amino acid changes at a particular position in the protein. So for example, I is isoleucine and G is glycine, but here it's about the mutation causing a change from one amino acid to another.

Looking at the methods section, they mention co-expression of pathogenic dLRRK(I1915T) or hLRRK2(G2019S). These are specific mutations. The kinase activity is also discussed, with I1915T and G2019S increasing it.

In the results, they show that these mutations affect reporter expression by stimulating it more than wild-type proteins. They also mention that the kinase-dead mutation (3KD) doesn't have an effect, reinforcing that the kinase activity is involved in the observed effects.

So putting this together, there are two specific mutations: I1915T and G2019S. The gene is LRRK2. These mutations lead to increased kinase activity, which then affects miRNA function by antagonizing them, leading to overproduction of E2F1/DP proteins.

I think the key details here are the gene name, the specific cDNA changes (if any) and protein changes. However, in this case, they directly mention the mutations as I1915T and G2019S, which likely refer to amino acid substitutions without specifying the exact cDNA position beyond the numbering.

I don't see information about the exact cDNA positions or the specific transcript used, so those fields would be "N.D.".
