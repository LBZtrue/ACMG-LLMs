Okay, so I need to figure out if the provided text paragraph contains information about mutations and extract the relevant details. Let me start by reading through the paragraph carefully.

The first sentence mentions that mutations in PINK1 or parkin cause autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson's disease. That clearly indicates the presence of mutations related to these genes. 

Next, it says that how these mutations trigger neurodegeneration is poorly understood, which again refers to the effect of these mutations but doesn't go into specific details about the mutation types or their positions.

Further down, the introduction part talks about genetic mutations causing familial PD and mentions that homozygous mutations in parkin or PINK1 are the main causes. It also notes that heterozygous mutations might be risk factors for late-onset PD but doesn't specify any particular mutations like cDNA changes or protein alterations.

I'm looking for specific mutation details such as gene names, exact positions, and changes at both cDNA and protein levels. The text mentions parkin and PINK1 as the genes involved but doesn't provide specifics on where the mutations are located (like position numbers) or what kind of changes occur in the cDNA or proteins.

So, while the paragraph does discuss mutations, it doesn't give detailed information about specific variants or their effects beyond the gene level. Therefore, I'll extract the gene names and note that no specific mutation details were provided.

The text discusses mutations in PINK1 and parkin genes causing autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease but lacks specific details about mutation types, positions, or changes.
