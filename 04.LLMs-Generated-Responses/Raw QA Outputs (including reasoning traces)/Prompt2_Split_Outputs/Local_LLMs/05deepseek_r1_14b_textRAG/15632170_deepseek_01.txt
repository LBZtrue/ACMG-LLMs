Alright, so I need to extract mutation information from the provided literature text. Let me start by reading through the paragraph carefully.

The first sentence mentions the E46K mutation in β-synuclein. That's a clear indicator of a mutation. It's part of the KTKEGV-type repeats and located in the amino-terminal region. The text discusses how this mutation affects amyloid fibril formation compared to A53T.

Looking further, there are mentions of Glu83 being mutated to Lys or Ala. These mutations also influence polymerization but alter some properties of mature amyloid.

I'll identify each mutation found:

1. E46K: This is the primary focus. It's in the KTKEGV repeats and increases fibril formation.
2. A53T: Compared as having a greater effect than E46K, though it's not the main subject here.
3. Glu83 mutations (to Lys or Ala): These affect polymerization properties.

I'll note that the text doesn't provide cDNA changes, only protein-level alterations. So in the JSON, I'll mark transcript info as N.D. since it's not specified.

Each mutation entry will include the amino acid change, position, and context from the literature. For E46K, the effect is increasing fibrilization. A53T is mentioned for comparison but isn't the focus here. Glu83 mutations perturb amyloid properties.

I need to structure this into JSON with "Gene" as β-synuclein and variants array containing each mutation's details. Any missing info will be marked as N.D.
