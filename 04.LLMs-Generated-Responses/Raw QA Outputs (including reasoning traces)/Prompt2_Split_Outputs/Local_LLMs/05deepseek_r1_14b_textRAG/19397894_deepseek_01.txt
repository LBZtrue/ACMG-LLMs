Alright, let's tackle this query. The user is looking for an expert in medical literature data mining to extract mutation information from a given text. They provided an example and specified the output format as JSON.

First, I need to carefully read the input text to identify any mutation-related terms. The provided paragraph mentions two mutations: G2019S and I2020T in the LRRK2 gene. Both are associated with Parkinson's disease.

I'll start by extracting the gene name, which is clearly stated as LRRK2. Next, for each mutation, I need to detail the cDNA changes and protein changes. 

Looking at G2019S: The "G" stands for glycine, "S" for serine. The position is 2019. Similarly, I2020T involves isoleucine changing to threonine at position 2020.

I notice that the input doesn't specify the exact cDNA positions beyond G2019 and I2020, so in the JSON, I'll mark the transcript as "N.D." since that detail isn't provided.

The descriptions in the context are accurately given as G2019S and I2020T. 

I must ensure all fields are filled; if any info isn't present, I'll use "N.D.". No extra details like ATP affinity or inhibitor effects should be included unless they describe the mutation itself.

Finally, structure the JSON with the gene name, list of variants each containing cDNA and protein changes, and their descriptions.
