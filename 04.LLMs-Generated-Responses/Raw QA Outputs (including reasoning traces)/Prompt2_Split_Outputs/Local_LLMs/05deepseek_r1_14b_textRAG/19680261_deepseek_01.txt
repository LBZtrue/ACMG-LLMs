Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I need to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. The user has provided an example and a sample JSON output, so I should follow that structure closely.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully to spot any mentions of mutations. Scanning through, I see terms like "mutation" in the context of DJ-1 and PD-associated mutations. Specifically, there are two mutations mentioned: D149A and L166P. 

For each mutation, I need to extract details like the gene involved (DJ-1), the cDNA changes if provided, protein changes, and a brief description from the context.

Looking at the first mutation, D149A: The text mentions it's an early-onset PD-associated mutation that makes DJ-1 resistant to caspase-6 proteolysis. There's no specific cDNA or protein position given here, just the amino acid change (Asp to Ala at position 149).

The second mutation is L166P: This one prevents DJ-1 dimerization but doesn't affect its proteolysis by caspase-6. Again, no cDNA info, just the protein change (Leu to Pro at position 166).

I'll structure each variant as an object within the "variants" array. Since there's no transcript information for either mutation, I'll mark that as N.D. The description for each will be taken directly from the text.

I need to ensure all fields are present in the JSON and correctly filled, using "N.D." where necessary. This way, the output is complete and adheres to the specified format.
