Alright, I need to tackle this query where the user is asking me to extract mutation information from a given medical literature text. Let's break down what they're looking for.

First, I should carefully read through the provided paragraph to spot any terms related to mutations. The context mentions "pathogenic mutations inactivate parkin by distinct mechanisms." That immediately signals that there are mutations discussed here.

Next, I look for specifics like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions of how these mutations affect the protein. From the abstract, it talks about C-terminal and N-terminal mutants. The N-terminal missense mutations are in the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL). So, the gene involved is parkin.

I need to note that the variants described don't have specific cDNA or protein changes listed—they’re categorized based on their location in the protein: C-terminal deletion, which affects membrane association and causes misfolding, and N-terminal missense mutations leading to degradation by the proteasome. 

The output should be a JSON with the gene name and an array of variants. Each variant will have sections for cDNA, protein changes (which aren't detailed here), and their descriptions. Since the cDNA details aren’t provided, I'll mark those as "N.D."

I also need to make sure that every field in the JSON is included, even if it's not mentioned. For example, providing a default value like "N.D." where information isn't available.

Finally, I structure the response according to the user’s specified format, ensuring accuracy and completeness without adding any speculative information beyond what's stated.
