Okay, I need to figure out how to extract mutation-related information from the provided literature text about molecular chaperones and Parkin RING1 domain mutants. 

First, I'll read through the context provided. The study discusses a Parkin RING domain mutant, specifically C289G, which causes misfolding and aggregation. This affects its ability to redistribute to damaged mitochondria and induce mitophagy. They also mention that this mutant can't function properly without chaperones like HSJ1a.

Looking for mutation terms: I see "RING1 domain mutant" and the specific mutation described as C289G. So, there's definitely a mutation mentioned here.

Now, breaking down the mutation details:

- Gene involved is Parkin.
- The variant is C289G. This seems to be a missense mutation since it's changing one amino acid to another (Cysteine to Glycine). However, in the text, they only mention the point mutation as C289G without providing cDNA or protein positions beyond that.

I don't see any information about the transcript (cDNA) change, so that'll be N.D. The protein change is from Cysteine to Glycine at position 289. But wait, in the example provided earlier, the protein position was p.G83D for instance, but here it's numbered as 289G without an alternative letter. So maybe just noting that it's a missense mutation affecting the RING domain.

The description in context is "C289G" which indicates the substitution of Cysteine at position 289 to Glycine.

Putting this into the JSON structure, I'll list Gene as Parkin, variants with cDNA change as N.D., protein change as Cys→Gly at 289, and the description from the text.

The literature discusses a mutation in the Parkin gene, specifically a RING domain mutant referred to as C289G. This mutation is a missense variant affecting the protein's function.
