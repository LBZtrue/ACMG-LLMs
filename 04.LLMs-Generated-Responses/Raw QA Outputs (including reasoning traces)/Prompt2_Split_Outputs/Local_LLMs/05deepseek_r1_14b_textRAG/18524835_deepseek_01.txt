Alright, so I need to analyze this medical literature paragraph to extract mutation information. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The abstract mentions a patient with early-onset parkinsonism who has the homozygous mutation p.W437X in PINK1. That's definitely a mutation; PINK1 is a gene associated with Parkinson's disease. The p.W437X suggests a truncating mutation, which is significant because it probably disrupts the protein function.

Next, looking further into the results section, it says that sequence analysis of the patient’s mtDNA found two new missense mutations: m.12397A.G in ND5 and m.14319T.C in ND6. These are mitochondrial DNA mutations. Missense means they change an amino acid but aren't necessarily truncating.

The patient's mother also has these mtDNA mutations, which might indicate inheritance. The fibroblasts showed increased superoxide production, which was inhibited by a complex I inhibitor. This suggests that the mutations in ND5 and ND6 (which are part of complex I) affect mitochondrial function, leading to oxidative stress.

So, putting this together, there are two types of mutations here: one in PINK1 (nuclear DNA) and two in mtDNA (ND5 and ND6). Each mutation has specific changes in cDNA and protein levels. The context describes these as missense mutations affecting complex I function.

I need to structure this into the JSON format, making sure each variant is listed separately with their respective details. Since some information like transcript might not be explicitly mentioned for PINK1's p.W437X, I'll mark those as "N.D.".
