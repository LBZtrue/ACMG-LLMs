Okay, I'm looking at the user's query where they want to extract mutation information from a medical literature paragraph. The user is an expert in analyzing such data and needs precise extraction of gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

First, I need to read the provided text carefully. Scanning through, I notice "E46K" which stands for Glu46Lys mutation. That's definitely a mutation related to Parkinson's disease as mentioned in the context.

Next, I'll break down the components:
- **Gene**: The mutated gene is α-Synuclein, often abbreviated as SNCA.
- **cDNA Change**: The change here is from glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K) at position 46. So cDNA would be represented as c.E46K.
- **Protein Change**: Similarly, the protein level change is E46K, where E becomes K.
- **Description**: The mutation's effect is discussed—how it affects channel formation and response to GM3.

I need to ensure all fields are filled, using "N.D." for any missing details. In this case, transcript info isn't provided, so I'll mark that as N.D.

Putting it together, the JSON should accurately reflect these points without adding anything not stated in the text.

```json

    "Gene": "α-Synuclein (SNCA)",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",

            },
            "Description in input context": "The E46K mutant of α-synuclein is linked to a familial form of Parkinson's disease and has a stronger affinity for GM3 than the wild-type protein. This mutation alters ion channel formation, leading to reduced conductance and altered selectivity for cations."
        }
    ]
}
