Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given paragraph about DJ-1 and Parkinson's disease. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The abstract mentions that DJ-1 is a multifunctional protein involved in transcriptional regulation and anti-oxidative stress. It also states that loss of its function can lead to the onset of Parkinson’s disease. Then, it talks about various mutants found in patients: M26I, R98Q, D149A, and L166P.

Looking at each part, I see that these are different mutations. The text mentions that these mutants were analyzed for their ability to form dimers with wild-type DJ-1 and their stability. It also discusses their anti-oxidative activities.

I need to extract the gene name first, which is clearly DJ-1 here. Next, I have to identify each mutation variant and note down any specific details provided about them in the text. 

For M26I: The paragraph doesn't specify whether this is a cDNA change or protein change, just mentions it as a mutant. So I'll note that without detailed changes.

R98Q: Similarly, this is another mutant mentioned but no specifics on the exact position or changes at the DNA or protein level are provided.

D149A: Again, just the name of the mutation is given with no further details.

L166P and C106S: These are specified as mutants. L166P's function in preventing H2O2-induced cell death is mentioned, but again, without specific cDNA or protein changes noted.

So, for each variant listed, I can only extract the name since that's all provided. There's no detailed information on where exactly these mutations occur in the gene (like position numbers) or what the reference and alternate alleles are at either DNA or protein levels. Therefore, all other fields related to cDNA and protein changes will be marked as N.D.

I should structure this into a JSON format with each variant having its details. Since there's no further information, those fields remain empty except for the mutation name.
