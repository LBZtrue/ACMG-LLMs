Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from this given paragraph about DJ-1 mutations linked to Parkinson's disease. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully. It starts with an abstract mentioning that mutations in DJ-1 are associated with familial forms of Parkinson’s disease. The study uses NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopies to look at five different mutations: L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A.

So, clearly, this paragraph is about DJ-1 mutations related to Parkinson’s. The key information here is the list of mutations and their effects on protein structure.

Now, I need to identify each mutation's gene, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions from the input context. 

The gene mentioned is DJ-1, which corresponds to PARK7 as stated in the text. Each mutation listed is a missense mutation because they are altering single amino acids without adding or removing any residues.

Looking at each mutation:

1. L166P: This means Leucine (L) at position 166 is changed to Proline (P).
2. E64D: Glutamic acid (E) at position 64 becomes Aspartic acid (D).
3. M26I: Methionine (M) at position 26 changes to Isoleucine (I).
4. A104T: Alanine (A) at position 104 becomes Threonine (T).
5. D149A: Aspartic acid (D) at position 149 is changed to Alanine (A).

The abstract doesn't provide specific cDNA changes, so for each variant, the transcript info would be N.D.

For each protein change, we can extract the reference and alternate amino acids along with their positions. The descriptions in the input context are given as L166P, E64D, etc., which correspond to the protein changes without cDNA specifics.

I should structure this into a JSON format, listing each variant under the "variants" array. Each variant will have its cDNA change (with transcript N.D.), protein change details, and the description from the text.

I need to make sure I don't include any extra information not present in the text. Since there are no specific mentions of cDNA positions or transcripts for these mutations, those fields will be marked as "N.D." as per the instructions.

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect each mutation's details as described in the paragraph without adding any speculative data.
