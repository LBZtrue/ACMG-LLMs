Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to act as a professional medical literature data mining expert, specifically looking for information related to mutations in the provided text. They've given an example and some constraints, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.

First, I'll read through the context provided. It's a journal article about PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy being compromised by PD-associated mutations. The authors are Sven Geisler and others, published in Autophagy in 2010.

The user wants me to extract mutation-related information. So I need to check if the text mentions any specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, or mutation descriptions.

Looking at the introduction: It talks about PD resulting from selective neuronal degeneration and mentions impaired protein degradation pathways with toxic misfolded proteins. But it doesn't specify which genes are mutated or provide any detailed cDNA/protein changes.

Moving on to the body of the text (even though it's not fully provided here), typically, such studies would discuss specific mutations in PINK1 or Parkin since they're central to mitophagy. For example, common PD-related mutations like G209A in PINK1 or E61K in Parkin might be mentioned.

Since the user's example output includes a Gene field and variants with cDNA and protein changes, I should look for those specifics. If the text had details like "c.61G>A (p.E61K) mutation," I would extract it accordingly.

However, based on the provided snippet, there are no explicit mentions of specific mutations or their cDNA/protein changes. It's more about the general concept that PD-associated mutations impair mitophagy but doesn't delve into specifics.

Therefore, since the text lacks detailed mutation information, all fields related to mutations should be marked as "N.D." except where explicitly stated.

I'll structure the JSON response with the Gene field as "PINK1" and "Parkin" since they're mentioned in the context of PD mutations. For variants, I'll note that there's no specific information available.
