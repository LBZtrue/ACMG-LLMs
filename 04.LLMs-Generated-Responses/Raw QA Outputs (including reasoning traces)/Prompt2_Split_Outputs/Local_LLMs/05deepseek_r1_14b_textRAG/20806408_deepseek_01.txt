Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from this given medical literature paragraph. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions that there are two novel mutations in the DJ-1 gene causing autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism. Specifically, it talks about a homozygous missense mutation resulting in L10P and another being a deletion of residue P158 (P158DEL). 

So, first, I need to identify if there are mutations mentioned. Yes, definitely, two types: L10P and P158DEL.

Now, for each mutation, I should extract gene name, cDNA change, protein change, and any additional descriptions.

Starting with the gene, both mutations are in DJ-1, so that's consistent.

For the L10P mutation:
- It's a missense mutation. The amino acid change is from Leucine (L) to Proline (P). But I don't see the exact cDNA position mentioned here. The abstract refers to it as L10P, which typically means the 10th residue in the protein, but without specific nucleotide changes.

For the P158DEL mutation:
- This is a deletion of Proline at position 158. Again, no exact cDNA change is provided; it's described as the deletion of residue P158.

I should note that the cDNA changes are not explicitly given, so I'll mark them as N.D. 

The protein changes are clear:
- L10P: Leucine at position 10 becomes Proline.
- P158DEL: Deletion of Proline at position 158.

In terms of the description in context, the abstract provides these exact mutation names, so I'll include those as well.

I don't see any other mutations or additional details beyond what's mentioned. So, it looks like there are two mutations to extract with their respective details.
