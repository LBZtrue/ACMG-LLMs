Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a detailed scenario where they are acting as an expert in analyzing literature data, specifically looking for mutation information. They want the response to be strictly based on what's explicitly stated and formatted into a JSON structure.

First, I'll read through the given text carefully. It talks about LRRK2 mutations being a common cause of Parkinson's disease, mentions specific percentages for different populations, and describes the G2019S mutation. There's also information about the protein structure and its domains.

I need to identify any mutation-related terms. "Autosomal dominant mutations" is mentioned early on, which indicates a genetic mutation. Then, it specifically names the LRRK2 gene and the G2019S mutation. This seems like the key mutation information here.

Next, I should extract the relevant details. The gene is clearly LRRK2. For the variants, there's only one mentioned: G2019S. I need to break this down into cDNA and protein changes. However, looking at the text, it doesn't provide specific nucleotide or amino acid positions for the mutation beyond "G2019S". This notation typically refers to a substitution where glycine is replaced by serine at position 2019.

In the JSON structure, I'll list the gene as LRRK2. Under variants, each object will have cDNA and protein changes. For cDNA, since the exact change isn't specified beyond G2019S, I'll note that the transcript is not detailed ("N.D."). Similarly, for the protein, the reference is glycine at position 2019 turning into serine.

I should also include a description from the input context. Here, it's "G2019S", which directly refers to both the cDNA and protein changes described in the text.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these details, ensuring that any missing information is marked as "N.D." as per the user's instructions.
