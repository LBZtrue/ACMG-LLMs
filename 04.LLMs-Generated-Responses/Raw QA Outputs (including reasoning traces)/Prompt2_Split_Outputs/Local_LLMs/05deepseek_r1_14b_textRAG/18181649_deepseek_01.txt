Alright, so I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to act as an expert data miner for medical literature. The goal is to extract mutation information from a given text paragraph and structure it in JSON format. If there's no mutation info, return "N.D.".

First, I need to understand what exactly the user is asking for. They provided an example where they extracted gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. The output was a JSON with specific fields filled or marked as N.D. if not present.

Looking at the input text, it's an abstract about DJ-1 mutations causing Parkinsonism. There are three missense mutations mentioned: A104T, E163K, and M26I. Each of these affects the protein structure in different ways.

So, I'll start by identifying each mutation. For Gene, it's DJ-1 across all three variants. Now, for each variant:

1. **A104T**: The text says this substitution introduces water and a disordered residue into the core. But there's no cDNA change mentioned. So, in the JSON, I'll mark transcript as N.D., since the description only refers to the protein level.

2. **E163K**: This disrupts a salt bridge with R145. Again, no specific nucleotide changes are given, so the cDNA part will be N.D.

3. **M26I**: Causes packing defects in the dimer. No cDNA info here either, so same as above for transcript.

Each variant's protein change is specified: A104T, E163K, M26I. For each, I'll note their positions and ref/alt changes.

Putting it all together, I structure each variant into an array under variants in the JSON. Since no cDNA info is provided beyond the protein level, those fields are marked as N.D.

I also need to ensure that all required fields are present, even if they're N.D., so the output remains consistent and complete.
