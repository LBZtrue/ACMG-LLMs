Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given text paragraph about PINK1 mutations and recessive parkinsonism. Let me start by carefully reading the provided context.

The first sentence mentions that several mutations in the PINK1 gene are associated with recessive parkinsonism. That's a clear indication of mutation data. Then, it specifies two point mutations: G309D and L347P. These are important because they're directly related to the gene and their effects.

Looking further, the text describes that G309D is stable and properly localized but has modest effects on kinase activity. In contrast, L347P leads to destabilization and drastically reduces kinase activity. This tells me about the impact of each mutation.

The protein changes are explicitly stated. For G309D, it's a change from glycine (G) to aspartic acid (D) at position 309. For L347P, leucine (L) is changed to proline (P) at position 347. These are the specific amino acid substitutions.

The text also discusses the effects of these mutations: G309D has minor effects on activity and stability but localizes properly, while L347P causes significant instability and loss of kinase function. This adds context to how each mutation behaves in the cell.

Now, checking for any other mutations mentioned, I don't see additional ones beyond G309D and L347P. The focus is primarily on these two. There's also some information about the localization of PINK1 protein, but that seems more about its processing rather than a mutation effect.

So, to structure this into JSON as per the example, I'll list each variant with their respective cDNA changes if available. However, in the text provided, only the protein-level changes are mentioned (G309D and L347P). The cDNA changes aren't explicitly detailed, so those will be marked as N.D.

In summary, the mutations are G309D and L347P in the PINK1 gene. Their effects include G309D having minor impact on activity and stability, and L347P causing significant destabilization and loss of function.
