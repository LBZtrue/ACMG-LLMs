Okay, I need to analyze this medical literature paragraph to extract mutation information. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The first part mentions PD-associated genomic deletions and the L166P point mutation leading to DJ-1 loss. So that's two mutations here: genomic deletions and L166P. But wait, is L166P a specific mutation or just a type? It seems like it's a specific missense mutation.

Next, the paragraph talks about the M26I mutation reducing DJ-1 expression, especially in knockout mouse fibroblasts. So that's another mutation: M26I. This affects expression and causes loss of protein.

Then there's C106A mutation mentioned as abolishing ASK1 binding because it's at a central redox site. That's the third mutation I found: C106A, which disrupts function by changing cysteine to alanine.

Additionally, [C106DD]DJ-1 is described, but that seems like a designed construct for experiments rather than a naturally occurring mutation. So maybe not relevant for extraction unless it's considered a mutation type.

Peripheral redox site mutations C46A and C53A are also mentioned. These affect ASK1 binding. So those are two more mutations: C46A and C53A, altering cysteine residues.

Finally, M26I is discussed again in relation to binding issues and failure to suppress ASK1 activity. It seems this mutation has multiple effects on protein function.

So compiling all the mutations found:

- Genomic deletions (but no specific details)
- L166P point mutation
- M26I mutation
- C106A mutation
- C46A and C53A mutations

I should structure this into JSON, ensuring each variant has its cDNA and protein changes. For genomic deletions, there's no specific info, so I'll note it as such. L166P is a missense with codon 166 changing from Leu to Pro.

M26I is another missense at position 26, Met to Ile. C106A replaces Cys with Ala, disrupting redox function. C46A and C53A are similar, affecting other cysteines.

The paragraph doesn't specify transcripts for most mutations except perhaps implicitly, but without explicit cDNA positions, I'll mark them as N.D.
