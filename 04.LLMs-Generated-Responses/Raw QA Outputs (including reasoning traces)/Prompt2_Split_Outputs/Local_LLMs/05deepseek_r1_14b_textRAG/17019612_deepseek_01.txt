Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to act as an expert in extracting mutation information from a given medical literature text. They provided a specific example and the structure they expect in JSON format.

First, I'll read through the input paragraph carefully. It mentions the Gly2385Arg variant of LRRK2 associated with Parkinson's disease. This is clearly a mutation as it involves an amino acid change from glycine to arginine at position 2385.

I need to identify the gene involved, which is LRRK2. Next, I'll look for cDNA and protein changes. The paragraph describes Gly2385Arg, so the protein change is straightforward: glycine (G) becomes arginine (R) at position 2385. However, there's no mention of the exact cDNA change like a specific nucleotide alteration.

The functional impact described includes that this mutation increases positive charge in the WD40 domain and affects toxicity under oxidative stress. These details should be included in the description.

I'll structure this information into JSON as per the example provided. For the cDNA change, since it's not specified, I'll mark it as "N.D." for each subfield. The protein change will include position 2385 and the amino acid alteration from G to R.

Finally, I'll ensure all fields are present and properly formatted, avoiding any omissions. This approach ensures accuracy and meets the user's requirements precisely.
