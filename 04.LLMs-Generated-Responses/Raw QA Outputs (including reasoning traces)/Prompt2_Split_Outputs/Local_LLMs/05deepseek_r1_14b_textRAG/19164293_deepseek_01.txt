Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation-related information from this given text paragraph. The user provided a detailed example and the specific JSON structure they want. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read the input text carefully. It's about a study on alpha-synuclein fibrillization and its relation to Parkinson's disease. They mention the A30P mutant specifically. So, there is definitely mutation information here.

Next, I need to identify the gene involved. The term "A30P" refers to a mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene. So, the gene name should be "SNCA", which stands for alpha-synuclein.

Now, looking at the cDNA and protein changes. The A30P notation means an alanine (A) is changed to proline (P) at position 30. In terms of cDNA, they didn't provide specific positions or transcript information, so those fields will be "N.D."

For the protein change, it's clear that residue 30 is altered from A to P. So, the Protein Change section will reflect that without any further details.

The description in the input context is given directly as "A30P", which I'll include exactly as stated.

I need to make sure not to include any other mutations mentioned elsewhere unless they're explicitly discussed in this paragraph. Since only A30P is relevant here, there are no additional variants to list.

Finally, structuring all of this into the specified JSON format without omitting any fields and ensuring accuracy.

    ]
}
