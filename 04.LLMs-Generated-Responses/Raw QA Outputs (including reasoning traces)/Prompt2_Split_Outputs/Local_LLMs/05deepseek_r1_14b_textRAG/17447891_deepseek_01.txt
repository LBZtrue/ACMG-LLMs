Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from this given paragraph. Let's read through it carefully.

The first sentence mentions that mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause late-onset Parkinson’s disease. That already tells me there are specific mutations discussed here related to PD. 

Next, the paragraph talks about what LRRK2 contains: leucine-rich repeats, GTPase domain, COR domain, kinase, and WD40 motif. Then it says little is known about regulation, substrates, or how mutations affect function. So far, no specific mutation details yet.

The authors then mention that activity was assessed by autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation. They used a KESTREL screen with a rat brain extract to find proteins phosphorylated by an activated PD mutant of LRRK2—specifically the G2019S mutation is mentioned here. So, G2019S is one mutation they tested.

Further down, they talk about other mutations: R1941H, I2012T, I2020T, and G2385R inhibited activity; while R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C, and T2356I didn't affect activity. These are all specific mutations in LRRK2 that were analyzed.

So, from this paragraph, I can extract multiple gene mutation details for LRRK2. Each variant would have its description as mentioned in the text. Since it's a single gene (LRRK2), the Gene field should be filled once with "LRRK2". 

Now, looking at the variants:
1. G2019S: This is explicitly called out as an activating mutation.
2. R1941H: Inhibits activity.
3. I2012T: Inhibits activity.
4. I2020T: Inhibits activity.
5. G2385R: Inhibits activity.
6. R1441C: No effect.
7. R1441G: No effect.
8. Y1699C: No effect.
9. T2356I: No effect.

Each of these is a protein variant, so their cDNA and protein changes would be based on the given descriptions. However, in the paragraph, only G2019S is described with "G2019S" which likely refers to a specific change (e.g., Glycine to Serine at position 2019). The others are mentioned as part of their effects but without detailed cDNA or protein changes provided. 

Wait, actually, the paragraph doesn't provide exact positions for these other mutations beyond R1941H etc., so in the JSON structure, I should mark transcript and any missing details as "N.D." except where specified.

So putting it all together: Gene is LRRK2, and each variant has its description as per the text. For G2019S, maybe it's a missense mutation; others similarly, but without exact cDNA changes provided beyond their locus codes (like R1941H implies position 1941). 

Therefore, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, listing each mutation with its description and noting where cDNA info is N.D. or not available from the text.
