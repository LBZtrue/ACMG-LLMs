Okay, so I need to analyze this literature paragraph and extract mutation-related information as per the user's instructions. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The first part mentions a study about the E163K DJ-1 mutant showing specific antioxidant deficiency. The authors are Chenere P. Ramsey and Benoit I. Giasson from the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Looking for mutation information, I see "E163K amino acid substitution" early on. That's a clear missense mutation in DJ-1. So, the gene is DJ-1, and the protein change is Glutamic acid (E) to Lysine (K) at position 163.

I need to check if there are any cDNA changes mentioned. The abstract doesn't provide specific nucleotide changes; it only mentions the amino acid substitution. So, for cDNA Change, all fields would be N.D., except maybe position, which is 163.

The introduction part talks about various mutations in DJ-1 causing PD, including truncation, missense, etc. But since the focus is on E163K, I think that's the primary mutation to extract here.

So, putting it all together: Gene is DJ-1, variant with cDNA change as N.D., protein change from E to K at position 163, and the description in context is E163K.

I should structure this into the JSON format specified. Make sure no fields are missing and use "N.D." where information isn't provided.

        }
    ]
}
