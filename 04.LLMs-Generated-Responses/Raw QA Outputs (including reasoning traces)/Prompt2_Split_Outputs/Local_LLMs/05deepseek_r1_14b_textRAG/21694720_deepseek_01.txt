Alright, I'm faced with a query where the user wants me to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. The user is an expert in analyzing such data and expects precise extraction following specific JSON guidelines.

First, I'll read through the provided text carefully to spot any mentions of mutations. Scanning each sentence, I notice that it discusses Parkin's ubiquitin-like domain and its role in autoubiquitination. There are sections about how pathogenic mutations disrupt autoinhibition, leading to constitutive activity. However, when looking for specific mutation details like gene names or cDNA/protein changes, there's nothing concrete.

The literature mentions that mutations in the parkin gene cause autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism but doesn't provide specifics such as cDNA changes or protein alterations. Without these details, I can't populate those fields accurately. 

According to the user's instructions, if mutation information isn't present, I should return "N.D." for each missing detail. Therefore, the JSON output will reflect that no specific mutations were found in the text, ensuring completeness and adherence to the format.

    "Gene": "parkin",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
