Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. Let's start by reading through the text carefully.

The paragraph discusses Parkinson's disease and focuses on iron overload and mutant α-synuclein. It mentions that SH-SY5Y cells were stably expressing DMT1 either singly or in combination with wild type or mutant α-synuclein. 

I know that "mutant" here refers to a variant of the gene, so this is definitely mutation-related. The key part is when it says they expressed "wild type or mutant -synuclein." So, the mutated gene here is α-synuclein.

Looking for specifics about the mutation: the text doesn't mention any particular nucleotide changes (cDNA) or amino acid substitutions (protein changes). It just refers to a mutant form without detailing what kind of mutation it is. Therefore, I can't extract specific cDNA or protein information because that data isn't provided in the paragraph.

So, putting this together, I should note that α-synuclein is involved with a mutation, but there's no detailed info on the specifics of the mutation itself.
