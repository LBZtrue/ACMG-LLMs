Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature text. The user provided an example where they extracted gene name, variants with cDNA and protein changes, and a description.

Looking at the input text, it starts by mentioning E46K as a mutation in a-synuclein. Then there's A30P and A53T also referred to, but those are already known mutations. The focus is on E46K here.

First, I should identify if any mutations are present. Yes, E46K is mentioned, so that's the main one. Also, the abstract mentions A30P and A53T as previously described mutations, so they might be relevant too.

For each mutation, I need to extract gene name, cDNA change, protein change, and description from context. Let's break it down:

1. **E46K Mutation**:
   - Gene: a-synuclein.
   - The text doesn't specify the exact cDNA position or the reference allele, but E46K implies that at position 46, glutamic acid (E) is changed to lysine (K).
   - So, Protein Change would be E to K at position 46.
   - Description: It's a missense mutation causing increased phospholipid binding and filament assembly.

2. **A30P Mutation**:
   - Gene: a-synuclein.
   - The text doesn't give the exact cDNA change, but it's a missense mutation (Ala to Pro at position 30).
   - So, Protein Change is A30P.
   - Description: It's mentioned as causing familial PD and DLB.

3. **A53T Mutation**:
   - Gene: a-synuclein.
   - Similarly, missense mutation changing Ala to Thr at position 53.
   - Protein Change: A53T.
   - Description: Also causes familial forms of the diseases.

Now, checking if there's any cDNA change specified. The text says E46K caused increased lipid binding and filament assembly but doesn't give specifics on the DNA level beyond being a missense mutation. So for E46K, transcript info is N.D., ref as E at position 46 changing to K.

Similarly, A30P and A53T are described without specific cDNA details, so their transcripts are N.D.

I need to structure this into the JSON format with each variant having its details. Since there are three mutations mentioned, I'll list them all under "variants".
