Okay, so I need to analyze this medical literature paragraph to extract mutation information. The user wants me to determine if there are any mutations mentioned and then pull out specific details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and their descriptions.

First, I'll read through the abstract provided. It's about PINK1 mutations causing late-onset sporadic Parkinson’s Disease. The abstract mentions that compound heterozygous mutations in PINK1 are the second most frequent cause of autosomal recessive parkinsonism after Parkin.

Looking for mutation terms: "compound heterozygous mutations" and specific changes like p.A244G and p.V317I. These are protein-level changes, right? So they're missense mutations since one amino acid is being substituted for another.

Now, I don't see any cDNA changes mentioned in the abstract. It directly talks about the protein alterations but not the DNA level changes like nucleotide substitutions or indels. The key point here is that the literature only describes the protein-level mutations without providing the corresponding cDNA information.

So, I should extract the gene (PINK1), list the variants with their protein changes, and note that there's no mention of cDNA or transcript information. Therefore, in the JSON structure, the "transcript" field under cDNA Change will be N.D., as it's not provided.

I need to make sure I follow the format strictly, including all fields even if some are N.D. Also, since the mutations affect the protein by substituting amino acids (Ala to Gly and Val to Ile), those details should go into the "Protein Change" section for each variant.

In summary, the mutations identified are p.A244G and p.V317I in PINK1. The abstract doesn't give cDNA changes, so all other fields related to DNA level remain N.D.
