Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from this given paragraph about a-synuclein and Parkinson's disease. Let me read through the text carefully.

The paragraph starts by introducing a-synuclein as an abundant presynaptic protein involved in Parkinson's disease. It mentions that mutations like A53T and A30P are linked to familial cases of PD. Then, it discusses experiments showing that the A30P mutant is defective in binding to phospholipid vesicles compared to wild-type a-synuclein.

I remember from my studies that mutations can be described in terms of their effect on protein structure and function. Here, the A30P mutation is highlighted as causing impaired membrane-binding activity. The text also compares this with the A53T mutation, which doesn't affect binding as severely.

Now, looking at the extraction requirements: I need to identify gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and their descriptions. Let's see:

1. **Gene**: The gene in question is a-synuclein, so "a-Syn" or more formally, "SNCA" (since that's the official gene symbol).

2. **Variants**: There are two mutations mentioned: A30P and A53T.

   - For A30P:
     - The cDNA change would involve an amino acid substitution at position 30 from alanine to proline.
     - In terms of protein, this is written as Ala30Pro or A30P.
     - Description: It's a familial PD-linked mutation that impairs membrane binding.

   - For A53T:
     - Similarly, it's an amino acid substitution at position 53 from alanine to threonine.
     - The protein change is written as Ala53Thr or A53T.
     - Description: Unlike A30P, this mutation doesn't impair membrane binding significantly.

Wait, but in the paragraph provided, the text actually refers specifically to the A30P mutant and mentions that A53T substitution is naturally occurring. So I need to ensure each variant is correctly captured with their respective effects.

I also notice that the text talks about a double mutant (A53T/A30P) which inherits the defective binding from A30P, indicating dominance of the proline mutation's effect. This suggests that A30P is more detrimental in this context.

So, putting it all together, I should structure the JSON to include both variants, each with their respective cDNA and protein changes, along with the descriptions provided in the text.
