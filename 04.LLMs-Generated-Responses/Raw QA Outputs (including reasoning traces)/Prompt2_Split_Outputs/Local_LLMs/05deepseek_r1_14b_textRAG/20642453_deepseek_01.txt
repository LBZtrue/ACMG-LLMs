Alright, I need to extract mutation-related information from the provided literature text. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The first paragraph mentions that LRRK2 is mutated in a significant number of Parkinson’s disease patients. So, there's definitely information about mutations here.

Looking further down, the study discusses specific pathogenic mutations. It lists five common ones: R1441C, R1441G, R1441H, Y1699C, and I2020T. These are all missense mutations since they change a single amino acid.

The text also mentions that these mutations affect phosphorylation of Ser910/Ser935, which in turn disrupts the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. This disruption leads to LRRK2 accumulating in cytoplasmic pools or inclusion bodies.

Additionally, there are three mutations (R1728H, G2019S, T2031S) that increase protein kinase activity by varying folds. These details about the impact on kinase activity are important for understanding their role in Parkinson’s disease.

I should note that while these are detailed, other mutations aren't described beyond their names and effects. Therefore, I'll extract all mentioned mutations with their respective cDNA and protein changes where possible.

Some mutations only have amino acid changes listed without specific cDNA positions, so I'll mark their cDNA as N.D. The kinase activity increases are also relevant and should be included in the description.

I need to ensure that each mutation is properly categorized under "variants," including any relevant details about their effects on protein function.
