Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given literature paragraph. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll read through the provided text carefully. The abstract mentions that mutations in the N-terminus of the gene encoding alpha-synuclein (α-syn) are linked to autosomal dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). It then talks about using a conditional transgenic mouse model expressing human mutant α-syn, specifically the A30P variant.

I need to identify any mutation-related terms. The key points here are "mutations" and "A30P alpha-synuclein." So, the gene in question is α-synuclein (α-syn). 

Next, I'm looking for specifics about the mutations: cDNA changes, protein changes, etc. The abstract doesn't provide detailed information about the exact nucleotide or amino acid changes leading to A30P. It just mentions that it's a mutant variant, so I don't have specific cDNA or protein change details.

Therefore, the JSON should reflect that while there is mutation information related to α-synuclein (gene name), the specific cDNA and protein changes are not mentioned in the text. So, those fields will be marked as "N.D." (Not Determined).

The literature paragraph discusses mutations in the N-terminus of the alpha-synuclein gene associated with Parkinson's disease and mentions a conditional model expressing A30P mutant α-syn. The specific cDNA and protein changes are not detailed.
