Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given paragraph. Let me read through it carefully.

The paragraph starts by talking about alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) and its role in Parkinson’s disease. It mentions that a-Syn has been linked to rare autosomal dominant forms of familial PD due to specific missense mutations: A30P, A53T, and E46K. These are the key points here.

I remember from my studies that missense mutations mean that one amino acid is substituted for another in the protein. So, each of these mutations (A30P, A53T, E46K) represents an alteration where arginine becomes proline at position 30, alanine becomes threonine at position 53, and glutamic acid becomes lysine at position 46.

Looking at the structure of a-Syn, these mutations are in different regions. For example, A30P is near the N-terminus, while E46K is more central. These changes can disrupt protein folding or interactions, leading to aggregation and neurotoxicity, which contribute to PD pathogenesis.

The study mentioned uses SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing these mutant forms along with wild-type a-Syn to test their effects under rotenone and maneb treatments. This setup helps in understanding how these mutations affect neuroprotection or toxicity under different conditions.

So, the main mutation information here are the three missense mutations: A30P, A53T, and E46K. Each of these is a single amino acid substitution. There's no mention of cDNA changes or specific positions beyond the protein level in this paragraph, so those fields will be marked as N.D.

I should structure this information into the specified JSON format, ensuring each mutation is listed with their respective details. Since there are three mutations, I'll create an array of objects within the "variants" field.
