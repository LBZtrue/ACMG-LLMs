Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given literature paragraph about DJ-1 and its role in Parkinsonism. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read the entire text carefully to identify any terms related to mutations. The abstract mentions that mutations in the DJ-1 gene are linked to autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism (AR-EOP). It also refers to a study where they used siRNA to downregulate endogenous DJ-1, leading to enhanced cell death under certain stresses.

Now, looking for specific mutation details. The text doesn't provide any cDNA changes or protein changes related to the mutations in DJ-1. It only states that there are mutations causing AR-EOP and that these mutations probably result in a loss of function since they're autosomal recessive.

I don't see any information about specific variants, like c. something or p. something, which would indicate particular DNA or protein changes. The focus is more on the functional consequences rather than the exact genetic alterations.

So, based on this analysis, there's no specific mutation data to extract. Therefore, all fields related to mutations should be marked as "N.D." except for the gene name, which is DJ-1.
