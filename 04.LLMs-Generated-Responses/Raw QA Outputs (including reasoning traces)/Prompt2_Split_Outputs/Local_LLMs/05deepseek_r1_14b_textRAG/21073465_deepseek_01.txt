Okay, I need to extract mutation information from the given medical literature paragraph. Let's start by reading through it carefully.

The first sentence mentions mutations in the LRRK2 gene causing Parkinson's disease. So that's a key point—LRRK2 is the gene involved.

Next, the abstract talks about the Y1699C pathogenic mutant specifically. That's our main mutation to focus on. The authors are studying this mutation in the COR domain of LRRK2.

Looking at the effects, the Y1699C mutation decreases GTPase activity, similar to other mutants like R1441C and T1348N. This suggests that GTPase function is impaired.

The study also discusses dimerization in the catalytic core. The mutation weakens ROC-COR dimerization but strengthens the intra-molecular interaction at the ROC:COR interface. This structural change likely contributes to the decreased GTPase activity.

Now, structuring this into JSON as per the template:

- Gene is clearly LRRK2.
- Variants will include Y1699C with its details.
  - cDNA Change isn't explicitly mentioned but inferred as a coding change leading to Y to C at position 1699. So "c.1699Y>C" makes sense, assuming it's in the protein-coding region.
  - Protein Change is straightforward: Y to C at position 1699.
- The description from the input context should be concise, just stating the mutation and its effect on GTPase activity.

I don't see any other mutations mentioned beyond Y1699C. So the JSON will only include this one variant with the information extracted accordingly.
