Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to act as a professional medical literature data mining expert. My role here is to extract mutation-related information from the provided text. 

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. It starts with their identification of PINK1 gene mutations in PARK6-linked Parkinson's disease (PD). That immediately catches my attention because it mentions mutations in the PINK1 gene associated with a specific form of PD.

Next, I look for details about the mutation itself. The text says they identified mutations but doesn't specify the exact cDNA or protein changes. They do mention that these mutations are linked to PARK6, which is a known locus for early-onset PD. However, without specific nucleotide positions or amino acid changes, I can only note that mutations were found in PINK1.

I also check if there's any description of the type of mutation, like missense, nonsense, etc., but none is provided here. So, all I have is that PINK1 gene mutations are associated with PARK6 and PD.

Since the abstract doesn't provide further specifics on the mutations beyond their existence in PINK1 and their link to PARK6, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, marking where specific details like cDNA or protein changes aren't available as "N.D.".
