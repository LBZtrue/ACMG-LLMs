Alright, let me break down how I approached this query. The user is asking for a data mining expert to extract mutation information from a given medical text. They provided an example where they extracted gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

First, I read the input paragraph carefully. It's about mutations in the parkin gene causing autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson’s disease. The mutations mentioned are K48A and R42P in the ubiquitin-like domain.

I need to identify whether there are mutation details present. Clearly, it does, so I proceed to extract the necessary information.

Looking for gene names: The paragraph mentions "parkin," so that's my first point.

Next, cDNA changes. The text doesn't provide specific cDNA positions or changes (like c.248G>A), only protein-level mutations. So, under cDNA Change, I'll note it as N.D., which stands for not determined.

For protein changes, the mutations are K48A and R42P. Each variant will be listed separately with their respective changes: lysine to alanine at position 48 and arginine to proline at position 42.

The description in context needs a brief summary of how these mutations affect parkin's function, like causing substrate ubiquitination defects.

I structure all this information into the JSON format as specified. Each variant is an object within the variants array, containing the relevant details. Any missing information is filled with "N.D." to maintain completeness.

Finally, I review the output to ensure accuracy and that all required fields are included without any omissions.
