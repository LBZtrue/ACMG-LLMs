Alright, I need to analyze the provided medical literature paragraph to extract information about mutations. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read the text carefully. It discusses LRRK2 gene mutations causing Parkinson's disease. The key terms here are "mutations" and "LRRK2 gene."

Looking for specific mutation details: The text mentions that mutations in LRRK2 cause PD but doesn't specify particular cDNA or protein changes like in the example (e.g., c.248G>A). It talks about the kinase domain being involved, but no exact variant is given.

I need to extract gene name and any mutation details. The gene is definitely LRRK2. As for variants, the text doesn't provide specific cDNA or protein changes, so I'll mark those as N.D.

The description in context would be that mutations in LRRK2 cause PD, but without specifics, it's a general statement.

So, my JSON will include "LRRK2" under Gene. Variants and their subfields will all be N.D. since no specific mutation details are provided.

```json
{
    "Gene": "LRRK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "Mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD)"
        }
    ]
}
