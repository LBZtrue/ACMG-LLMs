Alright, I'm looking at the user's query about extracting mutation information from a given text. The user is posing as an expert in medical literature data mining and wants me to determine if the provided text contains any mutation details. If it does, extract specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and their descriptions. Otherwise, I should return "N.D.".

First, I need to carefully read through the provided abstract and introduction of the study on PINK1 kinase and Parkinson's disease. The goal is to identify any mention of mutations related to this gene.

Looking at the abstract, it mentions that mutations in PINK1 cause recessive familial PD and are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage. However, it doesn't specify the exact cDNA or protein changes caused by these mutations. It focuses more on the structural analysis and the evolutionary history of the gene rather than detailed mutation data.

In the introduction, there's a brief mention that PINK1 has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting domain and a serine/threonine kinase domain similar to CaMK. It also references studies localizing the protein in mitochondria but again doesn't delve into specific mutations or their effects on the protein structure.

I'm noticing that while the text discusses the implications of mutations, it doesn't provide the specifics like cDNA changes (e.g., c.1234A>G) or protein-level alterations (e.g., p.Gly123Arg). Without these details, I can't extract precise information about the variants.

Therefore, based on the provided text, there's no explicit mutation data to extract. All mentions are at a general level without specifics on where and how mutations occur in the gene or protein.
