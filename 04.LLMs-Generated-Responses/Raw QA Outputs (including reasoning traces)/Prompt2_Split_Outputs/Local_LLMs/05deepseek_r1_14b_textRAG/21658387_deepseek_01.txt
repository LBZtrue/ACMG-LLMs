Alright, I'm looking at the user's query where they want to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. The paragraph is about LRRK2 and its role in Parkinson’s disease.

First, I need to read through the provided text carefully. The abstract mentions that mutations like R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T are associated with reduced interaction and phosphorylation of Akt1. These are specific mutations linked to PD.

I should identify each mutation: R1441C, G2019S, I2020T. Each has a gene (LRRK2) and effects on the protein function. The user wants these details extracted into JSON format with Gene, variants, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

I notice that for each variant, the description is given in the context as part of the LRRK2 mutations affecting interaction and phosphorylation. However, I don't see specific cDNA or protein position details beyond the mutation codes. So, I'll mark those positions as "N.D." since they aren't provided.

I need to make sure each variant is listed separately under variants with their respective changes and context descriptions. Also, ensure that any missing information is filled with "N.D." as per constraints.

Finally, structure this into the JSON format specified, ensuring all fields are included without omission.
