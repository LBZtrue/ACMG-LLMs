Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature context and wants me to extract mutation information. The example given uses JSON format with specific fields. My task is to determine if the input text contains mutation details and extract them accordingly.

First, I need to read through the input text carefully. The text mentions several mutations: A104T, E163K, M26I, A104V, M26L, and E163K/R145E. These look like protein changes, possibly from the gene's protein sequence. The text is discussing structural changes in proteins, such as dual conformations and RMS deviations, but the main mutations listed are the ones mentioned in the variants section.

Looking at the example provided, the user expects gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. However, the input text here doesn't mention specific genes or cDNA changes. It refers to mutations like A104T, which are protein-level changes (e.g., amino acid substitutions). The example in the user's message had a gene name (TP53) and cDNA change (c.248G>A), but here, the mutations are described as protein changes without specifying the gene or cDNA positions.

Wait, the input text might not have gene names or cDNA changes. The paragraph starts with "Context: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert" and then the user's question. The actual text to analyze is the part after that, which includes the table with data statistics for various mutations. The mutations listed are A104T, E163K, M26I, A104V, M26L, E163K/R145E. These are likely protein variants but not cDNA changes. The user's example included cDNA changes, but here, the text doesn't mention cDNA positions or gene names. 

So, according to the user's instructions, I need to extract gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and mutation descriptions. However, in the given text, there's no mention of gene names or cDNA changes. The mutations listed are protein-level changes (like A104T, which would be p.A104T if following standard notation). The text also refers to these mutations in the context of structural data, such as RMS bond length deviations, but not in terms of gene or cDNA.

Therefore, the extracted information should include the protein changes (like A104T), but since gene names and cDNA changes are not present, those fields should be "N.D." as per the constraints. The "Description in input context" would be the mutation names listed, such as "A104T" and others. However, the user's example included a description like "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", which combines cDNA and protein changes. In this case, the text doesn't provide cDNA information, so only the protein changes are present.

So, the JSON should have "Gene": "N.D.", and under "variants", each mutation listed (A104T, E163K, etc.) would have "cDNA Change" as "N.D." and "Protein Change" with the ref and alt amino acids and positions. However, the text doesn't specify the gene, so "Gene" remains "N.D.".

Wait, but the text might be discussing a specific gene. Looking back, the user's example had "TP53", but in this case, the text doesn't mention any gene. The paragraph is about data mining and the mutations listed are part of the table. The original context might be a study on mutations in a particular protein, but the text provided doesn't specify the gene. Therefore, "Gene" should be "N.D.".

So, the final JSON would have "Gene": "N.D.", and each variant would have "cDNA Change": "N.D." and "Protein Change" with the appropriate ref and alt, and position. For example, A104T would be ref: A, alt: T, position: 104. But wait, A104T is a protein change, which would typically be written as p.A104T. So, in the "Protein Change" field, the ref is A, alt is T, position 104. Similarly for others.

Therefore, the extracted information would list each of the mutations mentioned in the text as variants, with "Gene" and "cDNA Change" as "N.D." and "Protein Change" details filled in. The "Description in input context" would be the mutation name as listed (e.g., "A104T").
