Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given text. The input provided is a series of references and figures from a research paper, but no actual text paragraphs with mutation details. 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of mutations in the input. Looking through the content, there are references to figures and methods, like "E163K mutant" in the figure captions. However, the main text here doesn't include any paragraphs discussing mutations. The examples given by the user are about extracting specific mutations like c.248G>A, but in the provided input, there's no such detailed information.

The figures mention the E163K mutation, but the user's instruction is to look for information in the text paragraphs, not figure captions. Since the input text here is just the references and figure labels without the actual descriptive paragraphs, there's no mutation data to extract. 

Therefore, according to the constraints, if there's no mutation information, I should return "N.D." for all fields. The gene would be "N.D.", and the variants array would be empty. I need to make sure I'm not assuming any information from the figures since the user specified to focus on text paragraphs.

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": []
}
```
