Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to carefully read through the text to find any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, the main sections are about PINK1 phosphorylating TRAP1, methods, and results. The results mention that PINK1 phosphorylates TRAP1 at serine 142, and there's a figure showing this. However, there's no mention of any mutations in genes, proteins, or specific DNA changes. The text discusses phosphorylation, which is a post-translational modification, not a mutation. 

I should check if there are any other parts that might mention mutations. Scanning through again, the references and methods sections don't have any mutation details either. The only changes mentioned are phosphorylation events, not genetic mutations. 

Since there's no information about mutations in the text, according to the constraints, I need to return "N.D." for all relevant fields. The JSON structure should reflect that there are no mutations mentioned. I need to make sure that each part of the JSON is correctly filled with "N.D." where applicable. The user's example shows that if there's no mutation, the entire structure is filled with N.D. So I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring that the gene is N.D. and the variants array is empty.

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "N.D."
        }
    ]
}
```
