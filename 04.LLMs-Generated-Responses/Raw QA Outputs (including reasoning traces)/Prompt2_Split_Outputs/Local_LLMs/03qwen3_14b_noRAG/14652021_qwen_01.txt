Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully to identify any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, there are several sections. The main body discusses the role of DJ-1 in Parkinson's disease, mentioning the L166P mutant protein. Then there's a reference to a study by Miller et al. (2002) that identifies the L166P mutation in the DJ-1 gene associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease. Another part mentions the L166P mutant protein being unstable and forming higher protein complexes. There's also a mention of the L166P mutation in the context of the ubiquitin-proteasome system degradation.

So, the key points here are the DJ-1 gene and the L166P mutation. The cDNA change isn't explicitly mentioned, but the protein change is L166P. The description in the context links the mutation to early-onset Parkinson's disease and instability of the protein. 

I need to structure this into the JSON format. The gene is DJ-1. The variants array will have one entry with the protein change. The cDNA change is N.D. since it's not specified. The description includes the association with Parkinson's and the protein's instability. 

I should check if there are any other mutations mentioned, but from the text, it seems only L166P is discussed. The other parts talk about the effects of the mutation but not other variants. 

So the final JSON should have the gene as DJ-1, the variant with the protein change L166P, and the descriptions provided in the text.
