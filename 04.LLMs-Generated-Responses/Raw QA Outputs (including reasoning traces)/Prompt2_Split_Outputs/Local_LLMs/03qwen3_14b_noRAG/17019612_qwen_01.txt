Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature text and wants me to extract mutation information. The task is to determine if the text contains mutation details and extract relevant data like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

First, I need to scan through the input text to find any mentions of mutations. The example given in the query had a specific mutation format like "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", so I should look for similar patterns here.

Looking at the input text, there's a mention of "LRRK2 pathogenic substitutions in Parkinson’s disease" and specific mutations like "G2019S" and "I2012T", "I2020T". Also, in the references, there are entries like "LRRK2 G2019S as a cause of Parkinson’s disease" and "LRRK2 I2012T, G2019S, and I2020T mutations". 

Wait, the main text mentions "LRRK2 pathogenic substitutions" but doesn't specify the exact cDNA or protein changes. However, in the references, there are specific mutations listed. But the user's instruction says to extract information from the input text paragraph, not the references. So I need to focus only on the main text provided, not the references at the end.

In the main text, the paragraph mentions "LRRK2 pathogenic substitutions in Parkinson’s disease. Neurogenetics 6:171–177" but doesn't provide the specific cDNA or protein changes. There's also a mention of "LRRK2 in Parkinson’s disease: protein domains and functional insights" but again, no specific mutations. 

Wait, looking again, the user's input text includes the main paragraph and then a list of references. The task is to extract mutation information from the input text paragraph, which in this case is the main body, not the references. The references are separate and probably not part of the main text to analyze. 

Therefore, in the main text, the only mention of mutations is "LRRK2 pathogenic substitutions" but without specific details like cDNA changes or protein alterations. The examples in the query had specific mutations with cDNA and protein changes, but here the text doesn't provide those details. 

So according to the constraints, if the information isn't mentioned, I should use "N.D." to supplement. Therefore, the extracted information would have the gene as LRRK2, but the variants would have N.D. for all the fields since specific mutations aren't detailed in the main text. The description would be "pathogenic substitutions" but without the exact changes. 

Wait, but in the references, there are specific mutations, but the user's instruction says to extract from the input text paragraph, which is the main text, not the references. Therefore, the answer should be that the gene is LRRK2, but the variants are not specified in the main text, hence N.D. for all the fields.
