Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to extract mutation information from a given text. First, I need to carefully read the input text to see if there are any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the provided text, the key part is the paragraph that starts with "A patient with early-onset Parkinsonism..." and mentions mutations in the PINK1 gene and mitochondrial DNA. Specifically, it talks about a homozygous mutation in PINK1, c.175G>A, which changes the protein from Gly to Arg at position 59. Also, there's a heteroplasmic mutation in the ND6 subunit of mtDNA, m.14487A>G, leading to a Met to Val change at position 207.

So, I need to extract these details. The gene names are PINK1 and ND6. For the variants, the cDNA changes are c.175G>A for PINK1 and m.14487A>G for ND6. The protein changes are p.G59R and p.M207V. The descriptions in the context are "homozygous c.175G>A (p.G59R)" and "heteroplasmic m.14487A>G (p.M207V)".

I should structure this into a JSON format with two variants. Each variant should have the gene, cDNA change (including transcript, ref, alt, position), protein change (ref, alt, position), and the description from the text. For parts not mentioned, like the transcript for the mtDNA mutation, use "N.D.".

I need to make sure that all the details are accurately captured and that the JSON is correctly formatted. Also, check that there's no other mutation information in the text that I might have missed. Since the other parts of the text are references and other studies, they don't contain the specific mutation details. So the extraction is complete.
