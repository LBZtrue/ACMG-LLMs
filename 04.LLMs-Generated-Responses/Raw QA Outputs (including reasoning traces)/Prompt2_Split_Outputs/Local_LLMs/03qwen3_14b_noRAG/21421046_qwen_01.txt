Okay, let's see. The user provided a list of references from medical literature and wants to extract mutation information. The task is to check each paragraph for any mention of mutations and extract details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

First, I need to go through each entry one by one. Let's start with the first entry: "Context: ...". Wait, the user's input seems to be a list of references with titles and authors, but not the actual paragraphs. Hmm, maybe the user pasted the references but didn't include the actual text paragraphs they want analyzed. The example given in the question includes a specific text paragraph, but the input here doesn't have that. 

Wait, looking back at the user's message, the main input is the list of references with titles and authors. The user might have intended to include the text paragraphs but forgot. However, the question says "input text paragraph," which in this case is the list of references. But the example provided by the user includes a paragraph like "In a study of lung cancer patients..." which is different from the current input.

So, the user might have made a mistake in pasting the input. The answer should be "N.D." for each entry because the input doesn't contain actual text paragraphs with mutation details. The references listed are just titles and authors, not the content of the papers. Therefore, there's no mutation information to extract here. The correct response is to return "N.D." for all entries since the input text paragraphs are missing.
