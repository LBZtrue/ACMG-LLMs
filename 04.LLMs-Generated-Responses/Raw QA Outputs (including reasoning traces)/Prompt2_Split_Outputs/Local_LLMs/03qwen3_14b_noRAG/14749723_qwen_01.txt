Okay, let me start by looking through the provided text to see if there's any mention of mutations. The user is asking specifically about mutations, so I need to be careful to identify any gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, or descriptions related to mutations.

Looking at the text, the first part is about the antioxidant function of DJ-1 and mentions a study involving mutations in the DJ-1 gene. Then there's a section with references, but the main body of the text doesn't have specific mutation details like c.248G>A or p.G83D. The references list several studies, but they don't include the actual mutation details in the main text. 

Wait, the main paragraph doesn't have specific mutations described. The example given in the user's instruction includes a specific mutation, but in the provided text, I don't see any such details. The text mentions that mutations in the DJ-1 gene are associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease, but it doesn't specify the exact cDNA or protein changes. 

So, according to the workflow, if mutation information is found, extract the details. If not, return "N.D." In this case, the main text does mention mutations (like L166P in the references), but the main paragraph doesn't provide the specific cDNA or protein changes. However, looking again, the main text does mention "L166P mutant DJ-1" in the references, but the main paragraph might not have that. Wait, the main text is the part before the references. Let me check again.

The main text starts with "Antioxidant function of DJ-1" and discusses the role of DJ-1 in protecting against oxidative stress. It mentions that mutations in the DJ-1 gene are associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease, but it doesn't specify the exact mutation. The references list studies, like one by Macedo et al. (2003) that talks about the DJ-1L166P mutant protein. However, the main text itself does not include the specific mutation details. 

Since the user's instruction is to extract information from the input text paragraph, which in this case is the main body, not the references, the answer would be that the main text doesn't have specific mutation details. Therefore, the extracted information should have "N.D." for the gene and variants.
