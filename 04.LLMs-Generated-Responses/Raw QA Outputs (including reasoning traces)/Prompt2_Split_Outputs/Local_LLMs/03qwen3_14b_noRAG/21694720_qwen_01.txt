Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided text. The input is a paragraph from the EMBO Journal about the autoregulation of Parkin activity.

First, I need to scan the text for any mention of mutations. The title and the abstract don't mention any specific mutations, but let me check the details. The text talks about Parkin's role in ubiquitination and its regulation, but I need to look for terms like "mutation," "variant," "genetic alteration," etc. 

Looking through the paragraphs, the first few sentences discuss Parkin's structure and function. Then there's a mention of studies on Parkin's activity, but nothing about specific mutations. The authors are Chaugule et al., and the year is 2011. The rest of the text discusses mechanisms of Parkin, its interactions, and the implications of its regulation. 

I should check each sentence again. There's a mention of "mutations" in the context of other studies, but not in the provided paragraph. For example, in the list of references, there are studies on PINK1 and Parkin mutations, but the main text here is about autoregulation, not specific mutations. The example given in the user's instructions is about a TP53 mutation, which is not present here.

So, after a thorough check, the paragraph doesn't contain any specific mutation details. Therefore, the correct response is to return "N.D." for all fields.
