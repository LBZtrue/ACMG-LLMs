Okay, let's take a look at the user's question. They provided a list of references from medical literature and want to extract mutation information from them. The task is to determine if each paragraph contains mutation details and extract relevant data like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

First, I need to go through each reference one by one. Let's start with the first one. The first entry is about "PINK1 Accumulation Promotes Parkin Recruitment" from PLoS Biology. The abstract mentions PINK1 and Parkin but doesn't specify any mutations. It talks about their roles in mitophagy and neuronal survival. No mutations are mentioned here, so I should mark this as N.D.

Moving to the second reference, which is a study on "Impaired dopamine release and synaptic plasticity in the striatum of PINK1-deficient mice." The title mentions PINK1-deficient mice, but the abstract doesn't specify any mutations in the PINK1 gene. It's about the effects of PINK1 deficiency, not the actual mutation details. So again, N.D.

The third reference is about "A heterozygous effect for PINK1 mutations in Parkinson’s disease." The title here clearly mentions PINK1 mutations, so I need to check the abstract. The abstract states that a heterozygous effect for PINK1 mutations was found. However, the specific mutations aren't detailed here. The gene is PINK1, but the variants are not provided. So the gene is PINK1, variants would be N.D., and the description would be "heterozygous effect for PINK1 mutations in Parkinson’s disease."

Next, the fourth reference is "A wide variety of mutations in the parkin gene are responsible for autosomal recessive parkinsonism in Europe." The title mentions parkin gene mutations, and the abstract expands on that, noting a wide variety of mutations. Again, specific variants aren't listed, but the gene is parkin. So the gene is PARK2 (since parkin's gene symbol is PARK2), variants are N.D., and the description is the mention of various mutations.

The fifth reference is "Identification of a novel Zn2+-binding domain in the autosomal recessive juvenile parkinson’s related E3 ligase parkin." The title refers to parkin but not mutations. The abstract discusses a novel domain in parkin, not specific mutations. So N.D.

Continuing with the sixth reference: "A regulated interaction with the UIM protein Eps15 implicates parkin in EGF receptor trafficking and PI(3)K-Akt signalling." The abstract talks about parkin's interactions but not mutations. N.D.

The seventh reference is "A disease state mutation unfolds the parkin ubiquitin-like domain." The title mentions a disease state mutation in parkin. The abstract states that a mutation causes the ubiquitin-like domain to unfold. The gene is PARK2, and the variant might be N.D. unless there's more detail. The description would be the mutation causing structural changes.

Looking at the eighth reference: "A wide variety of mutations in the parkin gene are responsible for autosomal recessive parkinsonism in Europe." This is similar to the fourth entry. Gene is PARK2, variants N.D., and the description is the variety of mutations.

The ninth reference: "PINK1-associated Parkinson’s disease is caused by neuronal vulnerability to calcium-induced cell death." The abstract links PINK1 to calcium-induced cell death but doesn't mention specific mutations. N.D.

The tenth reference: "Loss-of-function analysis suggests that Omi/HtrA2 is not an essential component of the PINK1/PARKIN pathway in vivo." No mutations discussed here, so N.D.

The eleventh reference: "Drosophila HtrA2 is dispensable for apoptosis but acts downstream of PINK1 independently from Parkin." No mutation information, N.D.

The twelfth reference: "Atg32 is a mitochondrial protein that confers selectivity during mitophagy." Talks about Atg32, but no mutations. N.D.

The thirteenth reference: "Mitochondria-anchored receptor Atg32 mediates degradation of mitochondria via selective autophagy." Again, Atg32 is mentioned, but no mutations. N.D.

The fourteenth reference: "‘Rejuvenation’ protects neurons in mouse models of Parkinson’s disease." No mutation details, N.D.

The fifteenth reference: "Impaired dopamine release and synaptic plasticity in the striatum of PINK1-deficient mice." As before, PINK1-deficient but no specific mutations. N.D.

The sixteenth reference: "Mitochondrial rhomboid PARL regulates cytochrome c release during apoptosis via OPA1-dependent cristae remodeling." No mutations mentioned, N.D.

So, compiling all these, the only references with mutation information are the third and fourth entries. The third mentions a heterozygous effect for PINK1 mutations, and the fourth mentions a variety of parkin gene mutations. The others don't have specific mutation details.
