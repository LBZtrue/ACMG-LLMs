Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to carefully read through the text to find any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, I see several mentions of mutations. The first one is "Ala30Pro mutation in the gene encoding a-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease." That's a clear mutation in the a-synuclein gene. The notation here is Ala30Pro, which refers to a substitution at position 30, changing Alanine to Proline. The gene name is a-synuclein, which is also known as SNCA. I need to check if the gene is mentioned by another name in the text. The text does refer to it as "the gene encoding a-synuclein," so SNCA is the official gene symbol.

Another mention is "E46K, of alpha synuclein causes Parkinson and Lewy body dementia." Here, E46K indicates a substitution at position 46, changing Glutamic acid to Lysine. Again, the gene is alpha-synuclein/SNCA. The description in the context is "E46K."

There's also a mention of "Ala30Pro mutation in the gene encoding a-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease." That's the same mutation as the first one, but I need to check if it's repeated or a separate instance. Since the text mentions it once, I should list it once.

Additionally, the text refers to "the new mutation, E46K, of alpha synuclein causes Parkinson and Lewy body dementia." This is the same as the previous E46K mention, so it's the same mutation.

I need to make sure I capture all mutations mentioned, their positions, and the gene names. Also, check if there are any other mutations not mentioned here. The rest of the text talks about overexpression, protein interactions, and other studies, but no other mutations are noted.

So, the mutations are Ala30Pro and E46K in the SNCA gene. The cDNA changes aren't explicitly mentioned, so I'll put N.D. for those. The protein changes are Ala30Pro and Glu46Lys. The descriptions in the context are "Ala30Pro" and "E46K."

I should structure the JSON accordingly, listing each variant with their respective details. Make sure the gene is correctly identified as SNCA, even though the text uses a-synuclein. Since SNCA is the official symbol, that's the one to use.
