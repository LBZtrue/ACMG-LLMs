Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to read through the text carefully to spot any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, there's a section that says: "Point mutations (Thr240Arg and Gln311Stop) in the parkin gene." That's a clear mention of mutations. The gene here is parkin. Now, I need to parse the mutations. 

The first mutation is Thr240Arg. In terms of protein change, Thr is threonine, and Arg is arginine. The position is 240. So the protein change would be from threonine to arginine at position 240. 

The second mutation is Gln311Stop. Gln is glutamine, and Stop indicates a stop codon. So this is a nonsense mutation where glutamine at position 311 is replaced by a stop codon. 

Now, checking for cDNA changes. The text doesn't mention any specific cDNA positions or changes, like nucleotide numbers or transcript details. So those fields should be "N.D." 

The description in the input context would be the exact terms used: "Thr240Arg and Gln311Stop". 

I need to make sure I don't miss any other mutations. The rest of the text talks about other genes and proteins but no other mutations. So the only mutations are the two in the parkin gene. 

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the gene as "parkin" and the two variants with their respective details. Where information isn't provided, like cDNA changes, I'll use "N.D.".
