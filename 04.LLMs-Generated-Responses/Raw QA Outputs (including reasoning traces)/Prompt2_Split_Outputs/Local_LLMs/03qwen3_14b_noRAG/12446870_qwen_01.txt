Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraphs. First, I need to carefully read both paragraphs and look for any mention of mutations, genes, cDNA changes, protein changes, or related descriptions.

Looking at the first paragraph about dyskeratosis congenita and cancer in mice: The text mentions that mutations in DKC1 cause the disease. It also states that hypomorphic Dkc1 mutant (Dkc1m) mice show clinical features of DC. However, there's no specific mention of the type of mutation (like point mutations, deletions, etc.), cDNA changes, or protein changes. The only gene mentioned is DKC1, but the details about the mutation are not provided beyond the fact that it's a hypomorphic mutation. So, for this part, the gene is DKC1, but the variants and descriptions are not detailed enough to extract specific cDNA or protein changes. Therefore, I should note "N.D." for those fields.

Next, the second paragraph about Parkinson's disease and the DJ-1 gene. Here, the text says that the c.107G>A (p.R36H) mutation in the DJ-1 gene is associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease. This is a clear example with specific cDNA and protein changes. The gene is DJ-1, the cDNA change is c.107G>A, and the protein change is p.R36H. The description in the input context is provided as "c.107G>A (p.R36H)".

Now, I need to structure this into the required JSON format. For each gene, list the variants. If there are no specific variants mentioned, use "N.D." for the transcript, ref, alt, and position in both cDNA and protein changes. For the DJ-1 gene, the variant details are clear and should be filled in accordingly.

I should make sure that all fields are present even if they are "N.D." to meet the format requirements. Also, check that the JSON is correctly formatted with proper commas and brackets. No markdown, just plain text with the JSON structure.
