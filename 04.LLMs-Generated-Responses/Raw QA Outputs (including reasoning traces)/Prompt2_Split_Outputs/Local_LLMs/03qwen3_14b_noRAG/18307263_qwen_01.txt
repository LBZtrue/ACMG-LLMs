Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. First, I need to carefully read through the provided text to identify any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, there's a section that says: "Mutation information: PINK1 heterozygous rare variants: prevalence, significance and phenotypic spectrum." Then, in the references, there's a mention of "PINK1 heterozygous rare variants." Also, in the main text, the paragraph describes mutations in the PINK1 gene, specifically c.1366C>T and the associated protein changes. 

Wait, in the main body, there's a part that says "PINK1 heterozygous rare variants: prevalence, significance and phenotypic spectrum." So the gene here is PINK1. Then, looking at the references, there's a study by Marongiu et al. that discusses PINK1 heterozygous variants. Also, in another part, there's a mutation described as c.1366C>T, which leads to a protein change. The text mentions "the PINK1 c. 1366C>T mutation: implications in Parkinson disease pathogenesis." So the cDNA change is c.1366C>T, and the protein change is not explicitly stated here, but the reference might have more details. However, in the given text, the protein change isn't mentioned, so I should use N.D. for that. 

Another mention is in the context of the heterozygous effect for PINK1 mutations, but again, the specific cDNA or protein changes aren't provided in the input text. The main mutation described here is c.1366C>T. So, the gene is PINK1, the variant is c.1366C>T, and the protein change is N.D. because it's not specified in the text provided. 

I need to make sure I'm only extracting information that's directly mentioned. The other parts about heterozygous variants and prevalence are part of the study's focus but don't specify the exact mutation unless stated. Therefore, the only specific mutation mentioned is c.1366C>T in PINK1. 

So the JSON should have the gene as PINK1, and the variants array with the cDNA change details. Since the protein change isn't mentioned, it's N.D. The description in the input context would be "PINK1 c. 1366C>T mutation".
