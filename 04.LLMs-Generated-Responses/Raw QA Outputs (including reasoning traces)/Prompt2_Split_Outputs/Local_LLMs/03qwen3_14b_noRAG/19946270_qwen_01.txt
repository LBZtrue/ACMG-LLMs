Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to scan through the text to find any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, there are several sections with tables and figures, but the main content starts with "Context" and "Question". The actual data is in the tables. The first table is "Table 1: Frequencies of PARK2 Copy Number Loss" which lists different cancer types and their copy number loss data. The second table is "Table 2: Somatic Mutations of PARK2 in Human Cancers" which has detailed mutation information.

In Table 2, each row lists the cancer type, genomic position, normal genotype, tumor genotype, amino acid change, zygosity, and domain. For example, the first entry under Glioblastoma has a genomic position of 161889928, normal genotype GAG, tumor genotype GGG, amino acid change E344G, heterozygous, and the domain is InterPro IPR002867 IBR domain. 

I need to extract each of these mutations into the JSON format specified. Each mutation in the table should be an entry in the "variants" array. The gene is consistently "PARK2" across all entries. For each variant, the cDNA change includes the position and the nucleotide change, but the transcript is not mentioned, so that's "N.D.". The protein change includes the reference and alternate amino acids and their positions. The description in the input context is the combination of the genomic position and the amino acid change as listed in the table.

I should check each row in Table 2 to ensure all mutations are captured. There are entries for Glioblastoma, Lung, and Colon cell lines. Each has different genomic positions and mutations. For example, the Lung entry has a mutation at position 162126904 with AAC to AGC, leading to N254S. The Colon cell line DLD1 has two mutations: R420H and A379V, both heterozygous in the Ring finger domain.

I need to make sure that each mutation is correctly mapped to the corresponding fields. If any information is missing, like the transcript in cDNA changes, I should use "N.D." as instructed. Also, the description should reflect exactly what's in the table, combining the genomic position and the amino acid change.

Once all mutations are extracted, the JSON structure should have "Gene" as "PARK2" and an array of variants with all the relevant details. Each variant's cDNA change, protein change, and description should be filled based on the table entries. Any missing data should be marked with "N.D.".
