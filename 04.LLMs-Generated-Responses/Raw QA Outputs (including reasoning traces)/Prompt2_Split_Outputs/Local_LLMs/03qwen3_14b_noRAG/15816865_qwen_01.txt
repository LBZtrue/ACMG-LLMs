Okay, let's start by looking at the input text. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature context discussing Parkin mutations. The main question is to extract mutation-related information.

First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations. The paragraph starts by talking about Parkin mutations promoting aggregation. Then, in the references, there are several studies cited. For example, in the reference by Cheng Wang et al., they mention Parkin mutations leading to aggregation. However, the main text doesn't specify any particular mutations like c.248G>A or p.G83D as in the example. 

Looking through the text again, the abstract and the main body discuss the role of Parkin mutations in promoting aggregation, but there's no specific mention of the exact cDNA changes, protein changes, or specific mutations. The references list studies but don't include detailed mutation information in the provided text. 

The user's example shows that if the text doesn't have specific mutation details, we should return "N.D." for each field. Since the input text here doesn't provide any specific mutation details like gene names with cDNA changes or protein changes, the correct extraction would be to return "N.D." for all fields. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden details. The text mentions Parkin mutations in general terms but doesn't list any specific variants. Therefore, the answer should indicate that no specific mutation details are present in the text.
