Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided text. The input is a list of references from a study on PINK1 and mitochondrial defects. My task is to check each paragraph for any mention of mutations and extract the relevant details.

First, I'll go through each reference one by one. Let's start with the first entry:

1. **Reference 1**: "PINK1, a gene product of PARK6, accumulates in {alpha}-synucleinopathy brains. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry." 
   - No mention of mutations here. Just talks about accumulation of PINK1. So, "N.D."

2. **Reference 2**: "Proteasome dysfunction in aged human alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Neurobiol Dis 23: 120–126."
   - Again, no mutation details. Discusses proteasome dysfunction. "N.D."

3. **Reference 3**: "Altered cleavage and localization of PINK1 to aggresomes in the presence of proteasomal stress. J Neurochem 98: 156–169."
   - Mentions PINK1, but not a mutation. It's about cleavage and localization under stress. "N.D."

4. **Reference 4**: "Mitochondrial dysfunction in Drosophila PINK1 mutants is complemented by parkin. Nature 441: 1157–1161."
   - Here, "PINK1 mutants" is mentioned. This implies a mutation in the PINK1 gene. However, the text doesn't specify the type of mutation (like a specific nucleotide change or protein change). So, I can note "PINK1 mutants" as the description, but the other fields would be "N.D." because there's no detailed mutation information provided.

5. **Reference 5**: "Dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I and the proteasome: interactions between two biochemical deficits in a cellular model of Parkinson’s disease. J Neurochem 86: 1297–1307."
   - No mutation info. "N.D."

6. **Reference 6**: "Demonstration of a new pathogenic mutation in human complex I deficiency: a 5-bp duplication in the nuclear gene encoding the 18-kD (AQDQ) subunit. American Journal of Human Genetics 62: 262–268."
   - This one mentions a specific mutation: a 5-bp duplication in the gene encoding the 18-kD subunit of complex I. The gene isn't named here, but it's part of complex I. The cDNA change is a 5-bp duplication, but the exact position isn't given. The protein change is the 18-kD subunit. So, I can extract this as a mutation in the complex I gene, with the cDNA change as a 5-bp duplication and the protein change as the 18-kD subunit.

7. **Reference 7**: "A nonsense mutation in the NDUFS4 gene encoding the 18 kDa (AQDQ) subunit of complex I abolishes assembly and activity of the complex in a patient with Leigh-like syndrome. Human Molecular Genetics 10: 529–535."
   - This is a nonsense mutation in the NDUFS4 gene. The gene is NDUFS4, the protein is the 18 kDa subunit. The cDNA change is a nonsense mutation, but the exact position isn't specified. The description mentions "nonsense mutation" and the effect on the complex I.

8. **Reference 8**: "Characterization of proteins phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase of bovine heart mitochondria. FEBS Letters 377: 470–474."
   - No mutation info. "N.D."

9. **Reference 9**: "Dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I and the proteasome: interactions between two biochemical deficits in a cellular model of Parkinson’s disease. J Neurochem 86: 1297–1307."
   - Same as reference 5. "N.D."

10. **Reference 10**: "Molecular chaperones enhance the degradation of expanded polyglutamine repeat androgen receptor in a cellular model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Hum Mol Genet 11: 515–523."
    - No mutation info. "N.D."

11. **Reference 11**: "Mitochondrial dysfunction, peroxidation damage and changes in glutathione metabolism in PARK6. Neurobiol Dis 25: 401–411."
    - PARK6 refers to PINK1 mutations, but the text doesn't specify the mutation details. So, "N.D."

Now, compiling all the extracted information into the JSON format as specified. For each reference, if there's a mutation, list the gene, variants with cDNA and protein changes, and the description. If not, use "N.D." for all fields.

For example, in reference 6, the mutation is a 5-bp duplication in the gene encoding the 18-kD subunit of complex I. The gene name isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll note it as "Gene": "Complex I (18-kD subunit)" and the cDNA change as a 5-bp duplication at position N.D. Similarly, for reference 7, the gene is NDUFS4, with a nonsense mutation.

I need to ensure that the JSON structure is correct, with each variant having cDNA change and protein change objects, even if they're "N.D.".

            },
            "Description in input context": "5-bp duplication in the nuclear gene encoding the 18-kD (AQDQ) subunit"
        }
    ]
}
