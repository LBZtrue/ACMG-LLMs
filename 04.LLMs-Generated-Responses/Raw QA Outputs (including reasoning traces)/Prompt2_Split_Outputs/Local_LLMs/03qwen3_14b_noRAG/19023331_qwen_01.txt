Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided text. First, I need to read through the text carefully. The text is a scientific article discussing TTRAP and PD-associated DJ-1 missense mutations.

Looking at the sections, there's a mention of "PD-associated DJ-1 missense mutations" in the title and in the abstract. The main content talks about TTRAP interacting with DJ-1 and how missense mutations in DJ-1 are associated with Parkinson's disease. 

I need to check for specific gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. The gene here is DJ-1. The text mentions missense mutations but doesn't provide specific cDNA positions or protein changes like p.G83D. Instead, it refers to missense mutations in general without detailed variants. 

In the examples provided, when specific mutations like c.248G>A are mentioned, they are extracted. However, in this text, the mutations are only described as "missense" without specific nucleotide or amino acid changes. The references (like reference 23) might have more details, but the user's input is the paragraph given, which doesn't include those specifics. 

Since the user's instruction is to extract only information directly mentioned in the input text, and the text doesn't list specific cDNA changes or protein positions, I should return "N.D." for those fields. The gene is DJ-1, and the mutation type is missense, but without more details, the other fields remain N.D.
