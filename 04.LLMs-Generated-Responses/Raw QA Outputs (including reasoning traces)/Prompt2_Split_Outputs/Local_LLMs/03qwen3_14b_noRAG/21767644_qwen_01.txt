Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided text. The input is a list of references, but the actual text paragraphs from the literature aren't included here. Wait, looking back, the user provided a list of references but no actual paragraphs. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the input. The initial context mentions that the user needs to extract mutation info from paragraphs, but the input given here is just a list of references.

Wait, the original question might have a formatting issue. Let me check again. The user provided a list of references (like "Ubeda-Bañon, I., Novejarque, A., ... 2007.") but no actual text paragraphs. The instructions say to extract mutation info from the input text paragraphs. But in this case, there are no paragraphs provided. The user might have intended to include the paragraphs but forgot. However, looking at the example given, the input is a paragraph, not references. 

Wait, maybe the user included the references as part of the input, but that's not a paragraph. The task is to extract mutations from the text paragraphs, but here the input is just a list of references. That's confusing. However, the user might have intended to paste a paragraph but mistakenly pasted references. Alternatively, maybe the user is testing the system with references and expects that there are no mutations in them. But the references themselves don't contain mutation details; they are citations. 

In that case, the correct response would be that there's no mutation information in the provided input. The user might have intended to include a paragraph but instead included a list of references. Therefore, the answer should be "N.D." since there's no mutation info in the given text. 

But let me double-check. The user provided a list of references, which are citations from the literature. The actual text paragraphs containing mutation details are not present here. Therefore, the answer is N.D. because the input doesn't contain any text paragraphs with mutation information.
