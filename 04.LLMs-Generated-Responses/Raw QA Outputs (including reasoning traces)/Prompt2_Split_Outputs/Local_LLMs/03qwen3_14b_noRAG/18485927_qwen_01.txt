Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to extract mutation information from the provided text. First, I need to look through the given text and see if there are any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the references, there's a table labeled "Table 4" which lists various mutants like K27N, R33Q, R42P, K48A, and V56E. These look like protein mutations. Each entry has details about atomic distances and esds, but the actual mutation information is in the mutant names.

For example, K27N indicates a mutation where lysine at position 27 is replaced by asparagine. Similarly, R33Q is arginine to glutamine at position 33. These are standard single-letter amino acid codes. The table doesn't mention the gene name or cDNA changes, only the protein changes. 

The user's example shows that when there's a mutation like c.248G>A, it's extracted with gene, cDNA, and protein changes. However, in this case, the text doesn't provide the gene name or cDNA information. The table only lists the protein mutants. So according to the constraints, if the information isn't present, we should use "N.D." for those fields.

So the extracted information would include the gene as "N.D.", and each variant would have the protein change details with the specific amino acid substitutions. The description in the input context would be the mutant names like K27N, etc. Since the gene isn't mentioned, it's N.D. Similarly, cDNA changes aren't present here either.
