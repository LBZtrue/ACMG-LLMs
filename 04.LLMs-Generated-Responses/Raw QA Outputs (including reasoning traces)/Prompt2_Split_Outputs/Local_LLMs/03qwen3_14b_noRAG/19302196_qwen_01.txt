Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given paragraph of medical literature. The example provided uses a specific format with JSON, so I need to make sure I follow that structure.

First, I'll look at the input text provided. The user hasn't given a specific paragraph yet, but the example includes a sentence about TP53 gene mutations. My task is to check if the input text mentions any mutations and extract details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

Looking at the example, the output includes "Gene", "variants", and within each variant, "cDNA Change" with transcript, ref, alt, position, and "Protein Change" with ref, alt, position. The "Description in input context" is taken directly from the input.

Now, the user's current input is the list of references and the question. Wait, the user provided a list of references and then the question. The actual input text for mutation extraction isn't given here. Wait, looking back, the user's message includes a list of references and then the question. The actual text to analyze isn't provided in the user's question. Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the list of references as the input text? But the example shows a specific paragraph, not a list of references. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. 

Wait, the user's instruction says "extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature". The example uses a paragraph, but the current input includes a list of references (like journal articles) and the question. However, in the user's message, after the initial context, the question is presented, but the actual text to analyze isn't provided. Wait, looking at the user's message again, the part after the question is the list of references. But perhaps the user is testing with the example provided in the question, but that's not the case. Wait, the user's message includes a long list of references, then the question is presented. But the actual input text that needs to be analyzed isn't present. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the input. Alternatively, perhaps the input is the list of references, but that's not the case because the example uses a paragraph, not a list of references.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to provide a specific paragraph as the input, but due to formatting, it's not clear. However, in the current setup, the user provided a list of references and the question, but no actual text paragraph to analyze. Therefore, the answer would be "N.D." because there's no specific paragraph provided. But that's not possible because the user included an example with a paragraph. Maybe the user is asking for the system to process the list of references, but that's not the case. The example shows a paragraph, not a list of references. Therefore, the correct approach here is to inform the user that the input text paragraph is missing. However, since the user hasn't provided a specific paragraph to analyze, the answer should be "N.D." because there's no text to process. Alternatively, maybe the user included the references as the input text. Let me check again.

Looking back, the user's message includes a list of references, then the question. The references are from a journal article, but the actual text to analyze is not present. Therefore, the correct answer is "N.D." because there's no input paragraph provided. However, this might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to provide a specific paragraph, but it's not included. Given the information, the answer should be "N.D." since no text is provided for analysis.
