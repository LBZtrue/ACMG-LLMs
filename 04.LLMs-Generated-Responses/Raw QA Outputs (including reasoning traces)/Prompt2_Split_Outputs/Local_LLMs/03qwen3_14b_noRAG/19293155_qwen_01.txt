Okay, let's see. The user wants me to check if the provided text contains any mutation information and extract it. The text given is a list of references from a scientific paper, probably from a journal. Each entry has authors, journal names, years, and volume/issue numbers. 

Looking at the first few entries, like 1-10, they all seem to be citations. For example, entry 1 is "Abdallah, J., Caldas, T., Kthiri, F., Kern, R., and Richarme, G. (2007) J. Bacteriol. 189, 9140–9144". There's no mention of genes, mutations, or any specific changes here. The same goes for entries 2-10. They just list authors, journal, year, and page numbers.

Continuing through the list, entries 11-51 are similar. There's no text that describes mutations, genes, or any kind of genetic variation. All of them are references to studies, but the actual content of the studies isn't provided here. The user's task is to extract mutation info from the input text, but the input here is just a list of references. 

Since none of the entries mention any mutations, genes, or related terms, the answer should be "N.D." as per the instructions. The user's example shows that if there's no mutation info, we return N.D. So in this case, the correct response is to indicate that there's no mutation information present in the provided text.
