Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the provided text mentions any mutations and extract details if so. The input text is a list of references from a scientific paper about the helix interconversion of alpha-synuclein. 

First, I need to check each entry to see if there's any mention of mutations. Looking through the references, they all seem to be citations of studies related to alpha-synuclein's structure, Parkinson's disease, and related proteins. For example, references 62, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77 mention Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein, and related proteins, but none of them explicitly mention specific mutations. 

The titles and authors don't include any mutation details. The main focus is on structural biology, protein interactions, and disease mechanisms. The example given in the user's instructions includes a specific mutation (c.248G>A in TP53), but the provided text doesn't have anything like that. 

Since there's no mention of any mutations, genes, or protein changes in the input text, the correct response is to return "N.D." for all fields. The user's example shows that if there's no mutation info, the JSON should have "N.D." for each part. So the answer here is that there's no mutation information present.

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "N.D."
        }
    ]
}
```
