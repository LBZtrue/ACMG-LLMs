Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to read through the text carefully to spot any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, there's a section that mentions "LRRK2 mutations" and specifically names "I2020T" and "G2019S" as mutations. These are likely the key points here. The text also references studies on these mutations, like in the references [10] and others. 

Now, I need to check if there are gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. The gene here is clearly LRRK2. The mutations mentioned are I2020T and G2019S. However, the text doesn't provide cDNA changes (like specific nucleotide positions) but does mention the protein changes (amino acid positions). 

For example, I2020T refers to an isoleucine at position 2020 changing to threonine, and G2019S is glycine at position 2019 changing to serine. The descriptions in the context are "I2020T" and "G2019S" linked to increased kinase activity and other effects. 

I should make sure not to include any information that's not present. The cDNA changes are not mentioned, so those fields should be "N.D." The protein changes are present. Also, the descriptions from the text are the ones related to the mutations. 

I need to structure this into JSON as per the example. The variants array will have two entries for each mutation. Each entry should have the protein change details and the description. The cDNA change for each is "N.D." since it's not provided. 

Double-checking the references to confirm there's no other mutation mentioned. The rest of the text talks about LRRK2 in general but the specific mutations are the two mentioned. 

So the final JSON should have the gene as LRRK2, two variants with their respective protein changes and descriptions, and cDNA changes as N.D.
