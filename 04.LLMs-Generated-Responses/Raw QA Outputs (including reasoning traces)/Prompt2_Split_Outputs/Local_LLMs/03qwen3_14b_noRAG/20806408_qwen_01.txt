Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to read through the text carefully to spot any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, there are several mentions of mutations. The first one is "L10P" in the context of human DJ-1. Then there's "L166P" and "P158DEL". These are all protein-coding variants. The text also includes details about the oligonucleotide sequences for each variant, which might relate to the cDNA changes. 

For each mutation, I need to identify the gene, which is "DJ-1" here. The variants are L10P, L166P, and P158DEL. The cDNA changes are provided in the forward and reverse oligonucleotide sequences. However, the exact positions and nucleotide changes might be in the sequences given. For example, the L10P entry has forward and reverse primers, but the cDNA change isn't explicitly stated as a position and base change. The same goes for the others. 

The protein changes are straightforward: L10P means leucine at position 10 is replaced by proline, L166P is leucine to proline at position 166, and P158DEL indicates a deletion at position 158, which would be a frameshift or truncation. However, the text doesn't mention the exact cDNA positions or nucleotide changes, only the oligo sequences. Since the user's example included cDNA changes with positions and bases, but in this case, the text doesn't specify that, I need to check if it's present. 

Wait, the oligonucleotide sequences might contain the cDNA changes. For example, the forward oligo for L10P is "5’-GCT CTG GTC ATC CCG GCT AAA GGA GCA GAG-3’" and the reverse is "5’-CTC TGC TCC TTT AGC CGG GAT GAC CAG AGC-3’". But without knowing the exact reference sequence, it's hard to map these primers to specific cDNA positions. The user's example had explicit cDNA positions (like c.248G>A), but here, the text doesn't provide that information. Therefore, the cDNA change might not be present in the text, so I should put "N.D." for the transcript, ref, alt, and position. 

The protein change is clear from the variant names: for L10P, the protein change is from leucine (L) to proline (P) at position 10. Similarly for the others. The description in the input context would be the variant names as given. 

So, compiling this, each variant has the gene "DJ-1", the protein change as specified, and the cDNA change as N.D. since it's not explicitly stated in the text. The description would be the variant names. 

I need to make sure that all the extracted information is accurate and only includes what's present. Since the text doesn't mention the cDNA positions or the exact nucleotide changes, those fields should be "N.D.".
