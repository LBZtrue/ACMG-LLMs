Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given medical literature paragraph. First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations. The example provided by the user shows that they expect specific fields like Gene, variants with cDNA and protein changes, and a description.

Looking at the input text provided, which is a list of references, I see that each entry is a citation. But none of these citations have actual mutation details in the text. For example, the first entry is "Context: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert..." which is the user's setup, not the actual literature text. Then there's a list of references with authors, titles, journals, etc., but no specific mutation information.

Wait, the user might have pasted the references section of a paper, but in the actual input, the user's example shows that the input is a paragraph from the literature. However, in the given input, the user hasn't provided a specific paragraph but rather a list of references. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The user's instruction says to process a "paragraph of medical literature," but the input here is a list of citations. 

However, the user's example includes a paragraph with a mutation, so perhaps the actual input is the list of references, but the user hasn't included the actual text. Wait, looking back, the user's input is the entire text, which starts with "Context: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert..." followed by a list of references. But in the example, the input is a paragraph that includes a mutation. 

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake and included the list of references instead of the actual text. But according to the instructions, the user provided the input text paragraph. However, in this case, the input is a list of references, not a paragraph. So maybe the user intended to provide the list of references as the input, but the correct approach is to check if any of those references mention mutations. 

Looking at the references, for example, the first one is "Context: Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert..." which is part of the user's problem setup, not the actual literature. Then the list starts with "Malgieri and Eliezer 868 Protein Science, vol. 17" which seems like a reference entry. However, none of these entries have mutation details. Each entry is a citation without any mutation information. 

Therefore, since the input text doesn't contain any mutation information, the correct output should be "N.D." for all fields. The user might have intended to provide a different text, but based on the given input, there are no mutations mentioned. So the JSON should have "Gene" as "N.D." and "variants" as an empty array or "N.D." as per the constraints. However, according to the example, if no mutation is found, the output should be "N.D." but the user's example shows that when there's no mutation, the answer is "N.D." So in this case, the correct answer is "N.D." since the input doesn't contain any mutation details.
