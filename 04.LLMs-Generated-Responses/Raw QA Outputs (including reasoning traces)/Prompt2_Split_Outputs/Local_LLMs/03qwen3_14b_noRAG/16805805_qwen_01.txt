Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given text. The input is a paragraph from medical literature, and I need to determine if it contains mutation details. If it does, I have to extract gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. If not, return "N.D.".

First, I'll look through the provided text. The example given is about PINK1 mutations causing early-onset parkinsonism. Let me scan each paragraph for any mention of mutations. 

Looking at the first entry: "Valente E. M., Abou-Sleiman P. M., Caputo V., et al. (2004a) Hereditary early-onset Parkinson’s disease caused by mutations in PINK1. Science 304, 1158–1160." Here, it says "mutations in PINK1," but no specific mutations are detailed. So, I need to check if there are more details elsewhere.

Next, "Valente E. M., Salvi S., Ialongo T., Marongiu R., Elia A. E., Caputo V., Romito L., Albanese A., Dallapiccola B. and Bentivoglio A. R. (2004b) PINK1 mutations are associated with sporadic early-onset parkinsonism. Ann. Neurol. 56, 336–341." Again, mentions PINK1 mutations but no specifics.

Another paragraph: "Rohe C. F., Montagna P., Breedveld G., Cortelli P., Oostra B. A. and Bonifati V. (2004) Homozygous PINK1 C-terminus mutation causing early-onset parkinsonism. Ann. Neurol. 56, 427–431." Here, "homozygous PINK1 C-terminus mutation" is mentioned. So, gene is PINK1, and the mutation is in the C-terminus. But there's no cDNA or protein change specified. 

Another entry: "Silvestri L., Caputo V., Bellacchio E., et al. (2005) Mitochondrial import and enzymatic activity of PINK1 mutants associated to recessive parkinsonism. Hum. Mol. Genet. Oct 5 [Epub ahead of print]." This mentions "PINK1 mutants," but again, no specific details.

Looking at "Petit A., Kawari T., Paitel E., et al. (2005) Wild-type PINK1 prevents basal and induced neuronal apoptosis, a protective effect abrogated by Parkinson disease related mutations. J. Biol. Chem. 280, 34 025–34 032." Here, "Parkinson disease related mutations" are mentioned, but again, no specifics.

Another entry: "Paisan-Ruiz C., Jain S., Evans E. W., et al. (2004) Cloning of the gene containing mutations that cause PARK8-linked Parkinson’s disease. Neuron 44, 595–600." This refers to PARK8-linked, but the gene isn't named here. Wait, but earlier Valente et al. (2004a) mention PINK1 causing early-onset, which is PARK8. So maybe this is the same gene. However, the specific mutation isn't detailed here either.

In "Zimprich A., Biskup S., Leitner P., et al. (2004) Mutations in LRRK2 cause autosomal-dominant parkinsonism with pleomorphic pathology. Neuron 44, 601–607." This mentions LRRK2 mutations, but again, no specifics.

So, the only specific mutation mentioned is the "homozygous PINK1 C-terminus mutation" in the Rohe et al. 2004 study. The rest mention mutations in general terms but no specific cDNA or protein changes. 

Therefore, the extracted information should include that gene PINK1 has a mutation in the C-terminus, but since there are no cDNA or protein changes specified, those fields would be "N.D.".
