Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraphs. First, I need to read through each paragraph carefully to spot any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the first paragraph: "Clinical and pathological features of a Parkinsonian syndrome in a family with an Ala53Thr alpha-synuclein mutation." Here, "Ala53Thr" is a mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene. So, the gene is SNCA (since alpha-synuclein is encoded by SNCA), the protein change is from Alanine to Threonine at position 53. The cDNA change isn't specified, so it should be N.D.

Next, "Expression of A53T mutant but not wild-type alpha-synuclein..." Again, A53T is the same mutation as above. So, same gene and protein change. The cDNA change is still missing.

Another part mentions "A53T mutant but not wild-type alpha-synuclein..." Same as before. Then there's "c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene" in the example, but in the actual input, there's no mention of TP53. Wait, the input provided is a list of references, not the actual paragraphs. Wait, the user provided a list of references, but the question is about the input text paragraph. Wait, looking back, the user's input is the list of references, but the question is to process each paragraph. Wait, the user's input is the entire list of references, and the task is to check each paragraph for mutations. Wait, the user's input is the list of references, which includes many paragraphs. But the user's instruction says "input text paragraph", so maybe each entry here is a paragraph. Let me check each entry.

Looking through each entry:

1. "Clinical and pathological features of a Parkinsonian syndrome in a family with an Ala53Thr alpha-synuclein mutation." – Mutation: Ala53Thr in SNCA.

2. "Expression of A53T mutant but not wild-type alpha-synuclein..." – Same mutation.

3. "Inducible expression of mutant alpha-synuclein decreases proteasome activity..." – No specific mutation mentioned, just "mutant".

4. "In a study of lung cancer patients, it was found that the c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene..." – But this is the example, not part of the actual input. Wait, the user's input is the list of references, which includes the example. Wait, the user provided a list of references, and the task is to extract mutations from those. But the example is part of the user's instruction, not the input. Wait, the user's input is the list of references, which includes entries like "Clinical and pathological features of a Parkinsonian syndrome in a family with an Ala53Thr alpha-synuclein mutation." So, in that case, the mutation is Ala53Thr in SNCA.

Other entries mention "A53T" which is the same as Ala53Thr. So, the gene is SNCA, the protein change is from Alanine to Threonine at position 53. The cDNA change is not mentioned, so N.D.

Another entry: "c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene" – but this is the example, not part of the actual input. The actual input's paragraphs don't include that.

So, in the provided input, the mutations mentioned are in the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) with the Ala53Thr (A53T) mutation. Other entries may not mention specific mutations, so they would be N.D.

Therefore, the JSON should list SNCA with the variants having the protein change from Ala to Thr at position 53, and cDNA changes as N.D. for each occurrence.
