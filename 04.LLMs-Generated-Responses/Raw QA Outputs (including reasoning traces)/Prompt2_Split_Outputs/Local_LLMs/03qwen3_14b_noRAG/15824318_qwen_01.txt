Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. First, I need to scan through the text to find any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the text, there's a section that discusses mutations in the PINK1 gene. Specifically, it mentions the L260I and G309D mutations. The text also refers to a study by Shen and Cookson (2004) and Giasson (2004), which might be related to these mutations. 

Wait, the text talks about the L260I and G309D mutations in PINK1. I need to check if those are the only mutations mentioned. Let me go through the paragraph again. 

Yes, the paragraph states: "the L260I and G309D mutations in the PINK1 gene." There's no mention of cDNA changes, just the protein changes. The description in the context is "L260I and G309D mutations in the PINK1 gene." 

So, for each mutation, the gene is PINK1. The variants would be two entries: one for L260I and another for G309D. The cDNA change is not provided, so I'll put N.D. for transcript, ref, alt, and position. The protein change has ref and alt as the amino acids before and after the mutation, and the position. The description in the input context is as mentioned.

I need to make sure that I'm not missing any other mutations. The rest of the text discusses other genes and studies but doesn't mention any other mutations. So the answer should include these two mutations under the PINK1 gene. 

Alright, structuring the JSON accordingly with the gene name and the two variants. Each variant will have cDNA change details as N.D. and the protein changes. The description in the context will list both mutations.
