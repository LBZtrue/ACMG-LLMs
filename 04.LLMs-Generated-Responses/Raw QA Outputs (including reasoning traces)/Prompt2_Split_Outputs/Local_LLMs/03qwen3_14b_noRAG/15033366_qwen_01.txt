Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature text and wants to determine if there's any mutation information. The task is to extract details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions.

First, I need to read through the given text carefully. The text is about synuclein inhibiting PLD2. Looking through the paragraphs, I notice references to various studies and proteins, like alpha-synuclein, PLD2, and some other proteins. However, I need to check for any mention of mutations, such as gene names followed by specific variants, cDNA changes (like c.248G>A), protein changes (p.G83D), or any other mutation descriptions.

Looking at each paragraph:

- The first few paragraphs discuss the role of synuclein in inhibiting PLD2, mentioning binding to membranes, secondary structure stabilization, and interactions with other proteins. No mutations are mentioned here.

- The references (35-47) are citations, so they don't contain mutation info. The last part is the author information and the edited by line, which also doesn't mention mutations.

I don't see any mention of specific genes with mutations, cDNA changes, or protein alterations. All the information is about protein functions, interactions, and experimental methods. There's no indication of mutations in any of the text provided.

Therefore, the answer should be "N.D." as there's no mutation information present in the text.
