Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to check if the provided text contains any mutation information and extract it if present. The text given is a list of references from a scientific paper titled "Synergistic Effect of Iron and α-Synuclein on Autophagy" published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. 

First, I need to look through each entry to see if any mention of mutations is made. The references are numbered from 1 to 45, and each seems to be a citation of another study. The titles and authors of these references don't include any mutation details. For example, reference 1 is "Context:..." which is part of the user's initial message, not the actual literature. Then there are entries like "Cruz-Orive, L. M. (1987) J. Microsc. 145, 121–142" which is a citation but doesn't mention any genes, mutations, or variants.

Looking further, references 27 to 45 also cite studies but none of them seem to have mutation-related information. The titles and authors don't include any terms like "mutation," "variant," "SNP," or specific gene names with changes. The user's example shows that when a mutation is present in the text, it's extracted with details like gene, cDNA change, protein change, etc. However, in the provided text, there's no such information. 

I should also check if any of the references might be about mutations in Parkinson's disease, given the topic of α-synuclein, but the references listed don't include that. The user's task is to extract mutation info, and since none of the entries here mention mutations, the correct response is to return "N.D." for all fields.
