Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a medical literature data mining expert, specifically looking for mutation information in the provided text. The input is a list of references from a scientific paper, and I need to check each one for mentions of mutations.

First, I'll go through each entry one by one. Starting with the first one: "Context: ...". This seems to be setting up the context for the data mining task, not mentioning any specific mutations. So, I'll note that as N.D.

Next, looking at the "Question:" section. The user is asking about mutations in the provided paragraphs. The example given is a structured JSON output, so I need to make sure each entry in the references is checked for any mutation details.

Now, looking at the list of references. Each entry is a citation, like "Ono, K., Yamada, M., 2006. Antioxidant compounds...". These are all references to studies, but the titles don't mention specific mutations. The user's example shows that if a mutation is present in the text, it should be extracted. However, in these references, there's no mention of specific mutations like gene names, cDNA changes, or protein changes. The titles are about the effects of compounds on α-synuclein fibrils, or the role of α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, but not specific mutations.

Wait, looking at the example given by the user, they mention that if the input text paragraph contains mutation-related terms, extract them. But in the provided references, the text is just the citation entries. There's no actual paragraph text with mutation details. The user might have intended the entire block as the input text, but in this case, it's just a list of references. Therefore, none of these entries contain mutation information. 

So, for each of the references, since there's no mention of specific mutations, the answer should be N.D. for all. The user's example shows that if there's a mutation in the text, extract it; otherwise, return N.D. Since the input here is a list of references without any detailed text about mutations, the correct output is N.D. for each entry.
