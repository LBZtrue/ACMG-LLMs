Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given text paragraph. First, I need to carefully read through the provided text and look for any mention of mutations. The example given uses specific terms like "c.248G>A" and "p.G83D," so I should be on the lookout for similar notations.

Looking at the input text, there's a lot of scientific literature here, but I need to focus on parts that mention mutations. Let me scan through each paragraph. 

Starting with the first few lines: "Context: The user needs to extract information related to mutations from paragraphs of medical literature..." This is about the user's task, not a mutation itself. 

Moving down, there's a mention of "mutations in PINK1" in the Valente EM et al. 2004a entry. That's a gene name, but I need to check if there are specific mutations described. The text says "mutations in PINK1" but doesn't provide the exact cDNA or protein changes. So, I can note the gene as PINK1, but the variants would be N.D. since the specific changes aren't mentioned here.

Looking further, in the same Valente entry, it says "PINK1 mutations are associated with sporadic early-onset parkinsonism." Again, gene is PINK1, but no specific variants. 

Another entry: "Pink1 Parkinson mutations" in Weihofen A et al. 2007. This might refer to specific mutations in Pink1, but the text doesn't list them. The description mentions that these mutations influence Pink1's maturation or distribution, but without exact cDNA positions or protein changes.

In the Yang Y et al. 2006 study, they talk about inactivation of Drosophila Pink1 and how Parkin rescues it. No specific mutations listed here either.

Another mention is in the Silvestri L et al. 2005 paper: "Mitochondrial import and enzymatic activity of PINK1 mutants." Here, "mutants" is used, but again, no specific cDNA or protein changes are provided. So, the gene is PINK1, but variants are N.D.

I should check all entries again to ensure I didn't miss any. The example given in the user's prompt has a specific mutation, but in the provided text, most mentions of mutations are general, like "mutations in PINK1" without details. 

Therefore, the extracted information would include the gene PINK1, but since the variants are not specified, they should be N.D. for each entry. There might be multiple entries with the same gene but no specific mutations listed. Each occurrence of PINK1 mutations would be a separate entry in the variants array, but without the specific details, they remain N.D.
