Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to extract any mutation-related information from the text. The text is a paragraph from a medical literature paper discussing the role of LRRK2 mutations in Parkinson's disease.

First, I'll look for any mention of genes and mutations. The title mentions "LRRK2" which is a gene associated with Parkinson's. Then, in the first paragraph, there's a sentence: "Paisan-Ruiz, C., Jain, S., Evans, E.W., Gilks, W.P., Simon, J., van der Brug, M., Lopez de Munain, A., Aparicio, S., Gil, A.M., Khan, N., Johnson, J., Martinez, J.R., Nicholl, D., Carrera, I.M., Pena, A.S., de Silva, R., Lees, A., Marti-Masso, J.F., Perez-Tur, J., Wood, N.W., Singleton, A.B., 2004. Cloning of the gene containing mutations that cause PARK8-linked Parkinson’s disease. Neuron 44, 595–600." Here, it mentions mutations in the gene causing PARK8-linked Parkinson's disease, but it doesn't specify the exact mutation.

Looking further, in the references, there's a mention of "LRRK2 mutations and Parkinsonism. Lancet 365, 1229–1230." by Toft et al., 2005. This also refers to LRRK2 mutations but again without specific details.

Another reference: Zimprich et al., 2004, mentions "Mutations in LRRK2 cause autosomal-dominant parkinsonism with pleomorphic pathology." Again, the gene is LRRK2, but no specific mutations are listed.

In the main text, there's a part: "Testing association between LRRK2 and Parkinson’s disease and investigating linkage disequilibrium. J. Med. Genet. 43, e9." by Paisan-Ruiz et al., 2006. This seems to be about association studies, not specific mutations.

Another reference: "LRRK2 is expressed in areas affected by Parkinson’s disease in the adult mouse brain." by Simon-Sanchez et al., 2006. No mutation details here.

Looking back at the main text body, there's a sentence: "West, A.B., Moore, D.J., Biskup, S., Bugayenko, A., Smith, W.W., Ross, C.A., Dawson, V.L., Dawson, T.M., 2005. Parkinson’s disease-associated mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 augment kinase activity. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 16842–16847." Here, it's mentioned that mutations in LRRK2 are associated with Parkinson's disease and that they augment kinase activity. However, no specific mutation details (like nucleotide changes or protein positions) are provided.

Another part: "Smith, W.W., Pei, Z., Jiang, H., Moore, D.J., Liang, Y., West, A.B., Dawson, V.L., Dawson, T.M., Ross, C.A., 2005. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) interacts with parkin, and mutant LRRK2 induces neuronal degeneration. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 18676–18681." This mentions mutant LRRK2 but again without specific mutation details.

In the references, there's an entry by Zimprich et al., 2004, which states that mutations in LRRK2 cause autosomal-dominant parkinsonism. However, no specific mutations are listed in the text provided.

Putting this all together, the text repeatedly mentions that LRRK2 mutations are associated with Parkinson's disease, but none of the paragraphs provide specific details about the mutations (like cDNA changes, protein changes, or specific variant descriptions). The references are cited but don't include the exact mutation information within the text body.

Therefore, the answer should indicate that while the text discusses LRRK2 mutations, specific mutation details are not present in the provided paragraphs.
