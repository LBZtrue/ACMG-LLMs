Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature context and wants to extract mutation information. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any mentions of mutations.

Looking at the input text, the first part mentions "C418R (418), C441R (441), K161N (161) and R256C (256) mutated parkin constructs." Here, the gene is clearly "parkin," and the mutations are listed with their positions and changes. Each mutation follows the format of the amino acid change, like C418R, which probably stands for a cysteine to arginine change at position 418. Similarly, C441R, K161N, and R256C are other mutations. The user's example shows that the format should include gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. However, in the text, the mutations are described using protein numbering (like position 418) but not cDNA changes. The example uses both cDNA and protein changes, so I need to check if the text provides cDNA information. 

Wait, the text here only mentions the protein changes (like C418R) but not the cDNA positions. The example includes both, but the user's instruction says to extract what's present. So in this case, the cDNA change might be missing, but the protein change is present. Also, the description in the input context is given as "C418R (418), C441R (441), K161N (161) and R256C (256) mutated parkin constructs." 

Another part of the text mentions "Parkin mutations increase p53 expression in AR-JP-affected human brains." Here, the term "Parkin mutations" is used, but it's a general statement without specific positions or changes. So this might not be the mutation details the user is looking for, but it's a mention of mutations in the gene. However, the user's example includes specific mutations, so maybe the "Parkin mutations" here is a general term and not a specific mutation. Therefore, the main mutations to extract are the ones listed with positions and changes.

So, the gene is "parkin," and the variants are C418R, C441R, K161N, and R256C. Each of these corresponds to a specific position and amino acid change. However, the text doesn't mention the cDNA transcript or position, only the protein position. The example includes both cDNA and protein changes, but if the text doesn't provide cDNA information, we should use "N.D." for that part. 

In the JSON structure, for each variant, we need to include cDNA Change and Protein Change. Since the text doesn't provide cDNA details, the transcript, ref, alt, and position under cDNA Change should be "N.D." The Protein Change will have the ref, alt, and position as per the mutation names. For example, C418R would be ref: 'C', alt: 'R', position: '418'. But wait, the standard nomenclature uses the amino acid three-letter codes. However, the example uses 'G' and 'D', which are single-letter codes. So the user might be using single-letter codes here. So C418R would be ref: 'C', alt: 'R', position: '418'.

Wait, but 'C' here is the amino acid? Wait, the mutations are written as C418R, which is a bit confusing. Typically, mutations are written as, for example, p.G83D, where 'G' is the wild-type amino acid and 'D' is the mutant. So in the text, the mutation is written as C418R. That would mean the amino acid at position 418 is changed from Cysteine (C) to Arginine (R). But in the example, the user used 'p.G83D', which is the standard format. So the user's input text uses a similar format but without the 'p.' prefix. So the correct interpretation is that C418R is the same as p.C418R. Therefore, the ref would be 'C', alt 'R', position 418. Similarly for the others.

So, for each of the mutations listed, I'll extract the gene as 'parkin', and each variant will have the cDNA change as N.D. and the protein change with the respective ref, alt, and position. The description in the input context is the exact text provided in the input.

Putting this into JSON format as per the example, ensuring that all required fields are present with "N.D." where information is missing.
