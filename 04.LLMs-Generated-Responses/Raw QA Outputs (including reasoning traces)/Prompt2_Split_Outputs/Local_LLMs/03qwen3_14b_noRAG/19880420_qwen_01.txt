Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given text paragraph. The example provided uses a JSON format, so I need to make sure I follow that structure.

First, I need to scan the input text for any mention of mutations. The text provided is a list of references from a medical literature, each with a number and title. The task is to check if any of these references mention specific mutations.

Looking at each entry:

1. The first entry (1) talks about PINK1 mutations in Parkinson's disease. The title mentions "mutations in PINK1," but there's no specific cDNA or protein changes listed. So, I should note the gene as PINK1 and mark variants as N.D. since no specific details are given.

2. Entry 2 discusses a study on PINK1 and Parkin. The title doesn't mention mutations, just their interaction. So, no mutation info here.

3. Entry 3 is about DJ-1 and Parkinson's. Again, the title doesn't specify mutations, so N.D.

4. Entry 4 refers to a PINK1 mutation causing early-onset Parkinson's. The title says "mutation in PINK1," but again, no specific details. So, Gene: PINK1, variants: N.D.

Continuing through the entries, most titles mention genes like PINK1, Parkin, DJ-1, but don't provide specific mutations. Entry 47 mentions "Small interfering RNA targeting the PINK1 induces apoptosis," which is about RNA interference, not a mutation. Entry 46 talks about a mutation in DJ-1 (L166P), which is a specific protein change. Let me check that again.

Looking at entry 46: "Familial Parkinson’s disease-associated L166P mutation disrupts DJ-1 protein folding and function." Here, the mutation is L166P in DJ-1. So, the gene is DJ-1, the protein change is L166P. The cDNA change isn't mentioned, so that would be N.D. The description in the context is "L166P mutation."

Other entries like 47 and 50 might have mutations, but checking:

Entry 47: "Small interfering RNA targeting the PINK1 induces apoptosis in dopaminergic cells SH-SY5Y." No mutation here, it's about RNA interference.

Entry 50: "Ubiquitination of a-synuclein by Siah-1 promotes a-synuclein aggregation and apoptotic cell death." No mutation mentioned.

So, only entry 46 has a specific mutation. Let me confirm that. The title says "L166P mutation" in DJ-1. The gene name is DJ-1 (also known as PARK7), but the entry uses DJ-1. The protein change is L166P. The cDNA change isn't provided, so transcript, ref, alt, position are N.D. The description is "L166P mutation."

Therefore, the extracted information would have Gene: DJ-1, variants with cDNA change as N.D. and protein change as L166P. The other entries don't have specific mutations, so they are N.D.
