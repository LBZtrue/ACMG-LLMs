Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given text. The example provided uses a JSON format with specific fields. First, I need to check the input text for any mention of mutations.

Looking at the input text: it's a list of references from a study on α-synuclein (αSyn) and its interaction with the 20S proteasome. The text mentions mutations like E46K, A53T, and others, but they are referenced in the context of studies, not detailed in the text itself. 

Wait, the actual paragraphs are in the figures and the main text. Let me check again. The main text discusses the degradation of wildtype and mutant αSyn by the 20S proteasome. However, the specific mutations are not described in the text provided. The references mention mutations like E46K, A53T, etc., but the user's input text here is the abstract or methods section, which might not list the mutations. 

Wait, the user's input is the entire text, which includes references to papers that discuss these mutations. However, the user's instruction is to extract mutation info from the input text. The input text here doesn't have the actual mutation details; it just cites studies. Therefore, there's no specific mutation information in the provided text. 

So, according to the constraints, if there's no mutation info, return "N.D." But looking again, in the references, there's a mention of "E46K, of alpha-synuclein causes Parkinson and Lewy body dementia" from Zarranz et al. 2004. However, the user's input text includes that reference. But the user's instruction is to extract from the paragraphs given. The main text doesn't have the mutation details; it's in the references. 

Wait, the user's input is the entire text, including the references. The question is whether the paragraphs contain mutation info. The main text doesn't list mutations, but the references do. However, the user's example shows that if the text has the mutation in the context, like "c.248G>A (p.G83D) mutation in the TP53 gene", then extract it. In the given input, the references mention E46K, A53T, etc., but the main text doesn't. 

But the user's input text includes the figure captions and the references. The figure captions (like Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) don't mention mutations. The main text discusses wildtype and mutant αSyn, but the specific mutations are not detailed here. The references in the input text cite studies that found certain mutations, but the input text itself doesn't state the mutations. Therefore, the answer should be N.D. because the input text doesn't contain the mutation details, only references to studies that do.
