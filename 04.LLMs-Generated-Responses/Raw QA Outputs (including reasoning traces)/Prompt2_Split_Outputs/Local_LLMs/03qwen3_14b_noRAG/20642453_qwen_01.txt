Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a medical literature paragraph and wants me to extract mutation information. First, I need to check if the text mentions any mutations.

Looking at the paragraph, the main content is about a study on LRRK2 and 14-3-3 binding, discussing how Parkinson's disease-associated mutations affect kinase activity and localization. There's a mention of "41 PD-associated LRRK2 mutants" and "Table S1" summarizing their effects. However, the text doesn't list specific mutations like c.248G>A or p.G83D. It talks about groups of mutants but doesn't provide individual mutation details. 

The example given in the instructions includes specific cDNA and protein changes, but in the current text, those details are absent. The only thing mentioned is the existence of 41 mutants and their grouping based on kinase activity and binding, but no actual mutation identifiers. 

Since the user's goal is to extract specific mutation details like gene, cDNA change, protein change, etc., and the text doesn't provide those, I should return "N.D." for each of those fields. The presence of "PD-associated LRRK2 mutants" indicates that mutations are discussed, but without specific details, the answer must be N.D.
