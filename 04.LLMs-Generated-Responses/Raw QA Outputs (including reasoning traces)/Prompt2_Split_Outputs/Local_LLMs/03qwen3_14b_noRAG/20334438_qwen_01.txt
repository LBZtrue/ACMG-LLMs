Okay, let's start by looking at the provided text. The user wants me to check if there's any mutation information here. The text is about the mitochondrial proteome of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, which is a research article from the Journal of Proteome Research.

First, I'll scan through the text for any mention of mutations. The main body of the text seems to discuss methods and findings related to mitochondrial proteins in SH-SY5Y cells. There's a mention of Parkin, PINK1, and other mitochondrial-related genes, but I need to check if any specific mutations are discussed.

Looking at the paragraphs, I see references to studies involving alpha-synuclein mutations like A30P and A53T in other contexts, but in this particular text, the focus is on the proteome analysis. There's no mention of specific mutations in genes like Parkin, PINK1, or others related to mitochondrial function here. The examples given in the user's prompt were about TP53 and alpha-synuclein, but in the current text, there's no such information.

I need to ensure I'm not missing any hidden references. Let me check again. The text includes citations to other studies (like references 60, 61, 62, etc.), but the actual content here doesn't discuss mutations. The main points are about the mitochondrial proteome, methods used (like 2D gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry), and the identification of proteins. There's no mention of genetic mutations affecting these proteins in this particular paragraph.

Therefore, based on the information provided, there are no mutations described in this text. The answer should be "N.D." for all fields.
