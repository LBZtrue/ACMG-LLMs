Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given text. The input is a list of references from a medical literature paragraph, and I need to check each one for mutations.

First, I'll go through each entry one by one. Starting with the first reference: "Context: ...". There's no mention of mutations here, just context about the task. So I'll note that as N.D.

Next, the first example under "Examples" has a clear mutation: TP53 c.248G>A. But the user's actual input is the list of references, which are numbered from 1 to 61. Each of these is a citation, not the actual text content. So I need to check if any of these citations mention mutations. However, looking at the references, they are just titles and authors, not the content of the papers. So none of these references contain mutation details. 

Wait, but the user might have pasted the references as part of the input text. However, the way the question is structured, the input text is the list of references, which are citations, not the actual text paragraphs. Therefore, there's no mutation information in the provided text. 

But maybe the user intended the references to be part of the text to analyze. However, the references are just titles and authors, not the content of the papers. So the answer would be that none of the references mention mutations, hence all fields are N.D.
