Okay, let's see. The user wants me to check if the provided text has any mutation information and extract it. The input is a list of references from a paper, each with authors, journal, year, volume, pages, and DOI. But looking through these, none of them seem to mention specific mutations, genes, or any kind of genetic variation. They're all references to studies, some about Alzheimer's, others about lipid membranes, cell biology, etc. There's no mention of mutations in the titles or authors. So according to the instructions, if there's no mutation info, I should return "N.D.".

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me scan each entry again. For example, the first one is about APP and BACE1 in Alzheimer's, but no specific mutations. Another one is about lipid rafts and membrane domains. Then there's a study on alpha-synuclein and Parkinson's, but again, no mutations. The rest are references to various studies on proteins, vesicles, cell biology, etc. None mention any gene mutations, SNPs, or other genetic changes. So yes, there's no mutation information here. Therefore, the answer should be N.D.
