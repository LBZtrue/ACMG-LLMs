Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract about Parkinson's disease and wants to know if there's mutation information. The task is to extract any mutation details or return "N.D." if not present.

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main focus is on PD, iron homeostasis, DMT1, and α-synuclein. The paragraph mentions SH-SY5Y cells expressing DMT1 either singly or with wild type or mutant α-synuclein. Then it talks about Fe²⁺ uptake and cell death, especially with mutant α-synuclein. 

Looking for any mention of mutations. The text says "wild type or mutant α-synuclein." So here, "mutant" is a term related to mutations. But the question is about whether the input text contains mutation information. The user wants to know if there's any specific mutation details. 

In the context, the mention of "wild type" and "mutant" refers to the α-synuclein variant. However, the text doesn't specify the exact mutation type or the specific gene involved. It just states that the cells express either wild type or mutant α-synuclein. So, the mutation information here is that α-synuclein is present as wild type or mutant, but the exact mutation isn't described. 

The user's examples show that when a mutation is mentioned with specific details like cDNA change, protein change, etc., they are extracted. But in this case, the text doesn't provide specific mutation details. It just refers to the presence of wild type or mutant. So, even though there's a mention of mutation (wild type vs mutant), the actual specific mutation description is not given. 

Therefore, the answer should be "N.D." because the text doesn't specify any particular mutation, just the presence of wild type or mutant. The user's examples require specific mutation details, which aren't present here. So, the extracted information would have "N.D." for the gene, variants, etc.
