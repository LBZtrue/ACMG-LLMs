Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a scientific article and wants to know if it contains mutation-related information. The answer needs to be in a specific JSON format.

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main points seem to be about DNA toroids in D. radiodurans and how Mn²+ exposure affects their DNA repair. There's mention of DNA toroids and the repair mechanisms, but I need to check if there are any mutations discussed.

Looking at the text again: "We found that bacteria exposed to 100 M Mn²+ appeared as aggregates... DNA toroids could no longer be detected..." There's a mention of "DNA toroids," but the text doesn't explicitly mention any mutations or genetic changes. The focus is on the structural changes caused by Mn²+ exposure, not on specific mutations in genes.

The user's example shows that when a mutation is mentioned, like c.248G>A in TP53, the JSON includes gene name, cDNA changes, protein changes, and description. But in this case, the text doesn't mention any specific mutations or gene names. It talks about the effect of Mn²+ on the DNA structure, not about any particular gene's mutation.

So, the answer should be "N.D." because there's no mention of mutations in the text. The key here is that the paragraph is discussing the biological effects of Mn²+ on the DNA structure, not any specific mutations in genes. Therefore, no mutation information is present.
