Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants to know if it contains mutation-related information. If yes, extract the details; if not, return "N.D.".

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main points mentioned are about PARK2 gene mutations in human malignancies. The abstract talks about inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic deletions of PARK2 in cancer. It also mentions that PARK2 mutations in cancer abrogate the growth-suppressive effects of the protein. Additionally, it states that these mutations decrease PARK2's E3 ligase activity, leading to mitotic instability. 

So, the key terms here are "somatic mutations," "intragenic deletions," and "germline mutations." The gene mentioned is PARK2. The user's example shows that when a gene is mutated, they extract cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. 

Looking at the text, the specific mutations mentioned are in the context of cancer. The abstract mentions "inactivating somatic mutations" and "intragenic deletions." However, the exact cDNA changes or protein alterations aren't specified. The description in the input context is "inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic deletions of PARK2 in human malignancies." 

The user's example requires the position numbers and the specific mutations. Since the text doesn't provide the exact cDNA changes or protein alterations, even though it mentions somatic mutations and deletions, the specific details like the positions or the exact mutations aren't given. Therefore, the "variants" array would have "N.D." for the cDNA and protein changes. 

So, the answer should indicate that the text does contain mutation information, but the specific details like cDNA and protein changes aren't provided. Hence, the JSON should have the gene, with the variants array having N.D. for the required fields.
