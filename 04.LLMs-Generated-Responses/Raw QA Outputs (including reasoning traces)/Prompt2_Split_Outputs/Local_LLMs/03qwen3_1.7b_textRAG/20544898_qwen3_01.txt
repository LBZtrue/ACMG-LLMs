Okay, let's see. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants to know if it contains mutation information. The task is to extract relevant details if there are mutations, otherwise return "N.D.".

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The abstract talks about a-synuclein, its role in Parkinson's disease, mutations, gene duplication, and aggregation. Let me scan for any mention of specific mutations.

Looking at the text: "single point mutations and gene duplication/ triplication that are causally linked to early-onset familial PD" – here, "single point mutations" are mentioned. The gene duplication and triplication are also part of the discussion. However, the user's question is about mutations, so I need to check if specific mutation descriptions are given.

The abstract mentions "single point mutations" but doesn't specify the exact gene or the specific mutation details. The example provided in the user's example has a specific cDNA change and protein change. In this case, the text mentions "single point mutations" but doesn't list the specific gene or the exact mutation. The mention of "gene duplication/ triplication" is more about the phenomenon rather than specific mutations.

So, the key here is whether the text provides specific mutation details. The text does mention mutations in the context of PD, but the exact gene names or specific mutations aren't listed. The example in the user's example requires the specific cDNA and protein changes, which aren't present here. The abstract refers to mutations in general, not specific ones.

Therefore, since the text doesn't mention specific gene names, cDNA changes, or protein changes, the correct response would be "N.D." because the mutation information isn't explicitly stated. The mention of mutations is there, but without the specific details required by the example, it's not enough to extract the necessary information.
