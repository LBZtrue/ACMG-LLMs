Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants to know if it contains mutation information. If yes, extract the details; if not, return "N.D.".

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The key parts mention parkin mutations. The abstract talks about C-terminal and N-terminal mutants. Specifically, it mentions deletion of the C terminus leading to membrane association loss and rapid misfolding/aggregation. Then, four N-terminal missense mutations in the UBL domain causing proteasome degradation. Also, a 42 kDa species from human brain extracts, which is an internal start site without the N-terminal UBL.

So, the mutations here are the C-terminal deletion and the four N-terminal missense mutations. The 42 kDa is a smaller species, but the user's question is about mutations, so maybe that's a separate point. The user's examples show that when there's a mutation described, like the TP53 gene, they extract the gene, cDNA change, protein change, and description.

In the given text, the mutations are specifically mentioned in the context of parkin. The C-terminal deletion and the four N-terminal missense mutations. The 42 kDa is mentioned as a smaller species, but the user's examples include that as a separate point. However, the question is about mutations, so the 42 kDa might be considered a variant or a different entity, but the text doesn't explicitly state that it's a mutation. It says it's a smaller species present in extracts, which might be a result of degradation, but not necessarily a mutation.

So, the mutations mentioned are the C-terminal deletion and the four N-terminal missense mutations. The 42 kDa is a different entity, but the text doesn't describe it as a mutation. Therefore, the relevant mutations are the four N-terminal missense mutations and the C-terminal deletion.

The user's examples show that when there's a mutation described, like the c.248G>A (p.G83D) in TP53, they extract the gene, cDNA, protein, and description. In this case, the parkin mutations are described with specific positions and types. The C-terminal deletion is a deletion mutation, and the four N-terminal missense mutations are missense mutations. The 42 kDa is a smaller species, but not a mutation in the context of the text.

So, the extracted information should include the gene names (parkin), the specific mutations (C-terminal deletion and four N-terminal missense mutations), their positions, and the descriptions. The 42 kDa is not a mutation but a smaller species, so it's N.D. for that part.

Therefore, the JSON should list the gene as parkin, the variants with the C-terminal deletion and the four missense mutations. The 42 kDa is N.D. because it's not a mutation but a different entity.
