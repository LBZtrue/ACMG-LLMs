Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants to know if it contains mutation information. The goal is to extract relevant details if they do, otherwise return "N.D.".

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main topic here is α-synuclein (αS) and its mutations related to Parkinson's disease. The paragraph mentions three PD-linked mutations and how they affect the protein's conformations. 

Looking for specific mutation terms. The text says "three ␣S point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism." Then it mentions the ratio of protein to detergent determining the conformation. But does it specify the exact mutations? The example given in the user's instructions uses a format with Gene, variants, cDNA Change, Protein Change, and Description in input context.

In the provided text, the mutations are mentioned in the context of the PD-linked mutations. However, the exact details of the mutations (like specific gene names, cDNA changes, etc.) aren't explicitly listed. The text refers to the three mutations but doesn't provide specific sequence changes or protein alterations. 

The example in the user's instruction has a cDNA change with position 248 and a protein change with position 83. Here, the paragraph mentions "three ␣S point mutations" but doesn't give specific nucleotide changes or protein residues. The description in the input context is "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" which is a specific mutation, but the original text doesn't include that. The user's text might have that, but in the given paragraph, it's not present. 

Wait, the user's input text is the abstract provided. Let me check again. The abstract says "three ␣S point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism." It doesn't specify the exact mutations, just that they are point mutations. The example in the user's instruction uses a specific mutation like c.248G>A (p.G83D), but the original text doesn't mention that. The original text mentions the three mutations but doesn't provide the exact sequence changes. 

So, the user's text doesn't have the specific mutation details. The answer should be "N.D." because the mutations aren't explicitly described. The paragraph mentions the existence of the mutations but doesn't provide the specific genetic changes. Therefore, the correct response is to return "N.D." as there's no explicit mutation information provided.
