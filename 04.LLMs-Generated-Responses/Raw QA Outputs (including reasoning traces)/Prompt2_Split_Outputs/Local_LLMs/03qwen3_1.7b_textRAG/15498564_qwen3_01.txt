Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants me to extract mutation information if present.

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The key parts mention missense mutations A30P and A53T in the α-synuclein gene causing Parkinson's disease. Then there's a new mutation E46K identified in an inherited form of dementia with Lewy bodies. The study looks at the functional effects of this mutation on lipid binding and filament assembly.

So, the mutations mentioned are A30P, A53T, and E46K. Each has specific positions and the amino acid changes. The user's task is to extract these details. 

I need to check if the text directly states these mutations. The abstract does mention all three mutations, their positions, and the effects. The gene name is α-synuclein, and the variants are described with their positions and the corresponding amino acids. 

The output should include the gene, variants with cDNA and protein changes, and the description from the context. Since all the required information is present, I can structure the JSON accordingly. I need to make sure not to add any extra information or use N.D. where there's no mention. 

Double-checking the positions and the mutations: A30P is at position 30, A53T at 53, and E46K at 46. The context mentions these mutations and their effects. So all the details are there. The JSON should list each variant with their respective changes and the description from the text. 

I think that's all. No need for supplements since the information is directly provided.
