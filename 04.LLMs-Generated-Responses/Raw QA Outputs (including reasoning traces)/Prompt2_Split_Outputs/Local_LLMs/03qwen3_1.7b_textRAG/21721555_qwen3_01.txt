Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants to know if it contains mutation information. If it does, extract the relevant details; otherwise, return "N.D.".

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main points mentioned are about human and mouse α-synuclein aggregation differences, specific substitutions like A53T and S87N, and how these affect fibril formation and growth rates. The abstract also talks about fluorescence analysis and NMR chemical shifts.

Looking for mutation-related terms. The key mutations mentioned are A53T and S87N. These are specific amino acid substitutions. The text mentions that the A53T substitution dominates the growth kinetics, and the lag phase is affected by A53T and S87N. So these are mutations. 

Now, the gene names: α-synuclein is the protein involved, but the mutations are specific to the human and mouse variants. The abstract refers to human-mouse chimeras, so the genes here are α-synuclein. The mutations are A53T and S87N. 

The cDNA changes would be the specific positions. A53T is at position 53 in the human sequence, and S87N at position 87. The alt and ref are the amino acids. The position numbers are given as 53 and 87. 

The protein changes would be the amino acid substitutions: A53T (alanine at position 53) and S87N (serine at position 87). 

The description in the input context is the specific mutations mentioned, like "A53T substitution" and "S87N substitutions". 

So, compiling this into the JSON structure. The Gene field should be α-synuclein. The variants array would have two entries, each with cDNA and protein changes. The description in the input context is the specific mutations. 

I need to make sure that the positions are correctly noted. The original text says "position 53" and "position 87", so those are the positions. The cDNA changes are ref: G (for A53T) and alt: A (for A53T), and similarly for S87N. The protein changes are ref: G (for A53T) and alt: D (for S87N), but wait, the original text says "A53T substitution dominates the growth kinetics, while the lag phase is affected by a combination of the A53T and S87N substitutions." So the protein changes are A53T and S87N. 

Wait, the positions are 53 and 87. So for the cDNA changes, the ref is the original amino acid, and alt is the mutated one. For A53T, the original is T (since it's a substitution), but the position is 53. Wait, the text says "A53T substitution", so the ref is T, and the alt is A. But the position is 53. So in the cDNA change, the position is 53, ref is T, alt is A. Similarly for S87N, ref is N, alt is S at position 87. 

So the JSON should have two variants. Each with cDNA and protein changes. The description in the input context is "A53T substitution" and "S87N substitutions". 

I need to make sure that the positions are correctly noted. The user's example shows that the position is given as 248, but here it's 53 and 87. So the JSON should reflect that. 

Yes, the answer should include these details. The Gene is α-synuclein. The variants array has two entries: one for A53T and one for S87N. Each with cDNA and protein changes. The description in the input context is the specific mutations mentioned. 

So the final JSON should look like the example, with the correct positions and mutations.
