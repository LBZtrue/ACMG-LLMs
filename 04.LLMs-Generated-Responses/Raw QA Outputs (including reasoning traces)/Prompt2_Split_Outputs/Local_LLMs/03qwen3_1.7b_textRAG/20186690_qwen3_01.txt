Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants to know if it contains mutation information. If yes, extract the details; if not, return "N.D.".

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main points mentioned are about LRRK2 variants associated with Parkinson's disease in Chinese patients. Specific mutations like rs34778348 (G4A; p.G2385R) and rs33949390 (G4C; p.R1628P) are mentioned. Also, the absence of the common mutation rs34637584 (G4A; p.G2019S) in Chinese patients. Then, they sequenced coding regions in young onset and familial PD patients, found 59 variants, and examined them in 250 patients and 250 controls. Among 17 polymorphic variants, five had different frequencies in cases vs. controls. The relative risk is mentioned for certain combinations of mutations.

So, the key mutations here are the ones listed with their positions and protein changes. The user wants to extract gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. The gene is LRRK2. The variants mentioned are rs34778348 (G4A; p.G2385R) and rs33949390 (G4C; p.R1628P). Also, the common mutation rs34637584 is absent. The other variants like rs7133914 (G4C; p.R1398H) and rs7308720 (C4A; p.N551K) are mentioned in the context of their effect on risk when combined with other mutations.

I need to make sure I capture all these mutations. The user's example shows that when a gene is mentioned with specific mutations, they should be extracted. The answer should list each mutation with its cDNA and protein changes, and the description from the text. The common mutation rs34637584 is absent in Chinese patients, so that's another point to include. Also, the relative risk calculations are part of the mutation effects, but the user's instructions say to extract only direct mutation info. The part about the risk being reduced if certain mutations are present is part of the analysis, but the question is about the mutations themselves, not the risk analysis.

So, the extracted information should include the gene LRRK2, the specific mutations with their positions and protein changes, and the absence of the common mutation in Chinese patients. The other variants like rs7133914 and rs7308720 are also mentioned, so they should be included as well. The user's example includes all these details, so I need to make sure all relevant mutations are captured.
