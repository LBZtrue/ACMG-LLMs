Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature review and wants to know if it contains mutation information. The task is to extract relevant details if they do, otherwise return "N.D.".

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main points mentioned are about PINK1 mutations in PARK6-linked PD. The abstract mentions that they identified PINK1 gene mutations in PARK6-linked PD. Then it talks about PINK1 localizing to Lewy bodies and some experiments with proteasome inhibition and aggresomes.

Looking for specific mutation details. The paragraph says "PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene mutations in PARK6-linked Parkinson's disease (PD)"—so the gene name is PINK1. The user might be looking for the specific mutations, but the text doesn't mention any particular mutations. It just states that mutations are identified in PARK6-linked PD. 

The next part mentions that PINK1 is one of six genes associated with Mendelian-inherited PD, including LRKK2. But the specific mutations for PINK1 are not detailed here. The text doesn't specify any particular cDNA changes, protein changes, or mutation descriptions. 

The abstract discusses the mechanism of LB formation and proteasomal stress, but there's no mention of specific mutations in the PINK1 gene. The user's example shows that if a mutation is mentioned, like the TP53 gene's c.248G>A mutation, then it's extracted. But in this case, the text doesn't provide specific mutation details. 

So, even though the study identified mutations in PARK6-linked PD, the exact mutations (like specific cDNA or protein changes) aren't mentioned. The text only states that mutations are present in the gene associated with PD, but doesn't give the specific mutations. Therefore, the answer should be "N.D." because the mutation details aren't provided in the given text.
