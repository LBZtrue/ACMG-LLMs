Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph about Parkinson's disease and wants to know if it contains mutation information. The goal is to extract relevant details if there are mutations mentioned.

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main focus is on PINK1 and its role in PD. The abstract mentions mutations in PINK1 causing familial PD and discusses the structure of the gene. 

Looking for specific mutation terms. The paragraph says "mutations in PINK1 were shown to cause recessive familial PD" but doesn't specify any particular mutation. It mentions the gene's structure but doesn't talk about specific mutations like cDNA changes or protein alterations. 

The introduction also talks about five genes associated with familial PD but doesn't mention specific mutations for any of them. The examples in the user's previous interaction show how to extract mutations when they are explicitly mentioned, like the TP53 gene's c.248G>A mutation. 

Since the current text doesn't mention any specific mutations, even in the context of PINK1, the answer should be "N.D." because there's no explicit mutation information provided. The user's examples show that even if a gene is mentioned, but no specific mutation is given, it's still N.D. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden references. The paragraph does mention the gene's structure and some related terms, but no mutations are specified. So, the correct response is to return "N.D." as there's no mutation information present.
