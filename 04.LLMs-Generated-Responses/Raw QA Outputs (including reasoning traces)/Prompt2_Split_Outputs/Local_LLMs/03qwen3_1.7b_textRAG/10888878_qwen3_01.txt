Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract about Autosomal Recessive Juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) and wants to know if there's mutation information. 

First, I need to read the abstract carefully. The main points are that AR-JP is caused by PARK2 mutations, which lead to selective dopaminergic cell death without Lewy bodies. The study mentions that mutant parkins from AR-JP patients lose ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. 

Now, looking for mutation-related terms. The text mentions "mutations of which cause AR-JP" and refers to "mutant parkins from AR-JP patients." But the specific details about the mutations aren't provided in the text. The example given in the context uses a specific mutation (c.248G>A (p.G83D)), but in the current paragraph, the mutation description is not detailed. 

The user's goal is to extract mutation information if present. Since the current paragraph doesn't specify the exact mutations, even though it mentions PARK2 and mutant parkins, there's no specific cDNA or protein change mentioned. The text only states the presence of mutations without detailing them. 

So, according to the constraints, if the mutation details aren't provided, we should return "N.D." for the gene, variants, and description. The gene is PARK2, but there's no specific mutation described. The variants section would have "N.D." for all entries. 

Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the mutation information is not present in the given text.
