Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants to know if it contains mutation-related information. If it does, extract the details; otherwise, return "N.D.".

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main points mentioned are about Parkinson's disease (PD) and the DJ-1 protein. The paragraph talks about various mutations, like M26I, C106A, C46A, C53A, and others. 

Looking at the mutations: M26I is a point mutation, as is C106A. The text describes these mutations in the context of their effects on DJ-1 protein. For example, the M26I mutation reduces DJ-1 expression, especially in knockout mice. Similarly, the C106A mutation abolishes binding to ASK1 and reduces cytoprotective activity. 

So, the gene mentioned here is DJ-1. The mutations listed are M26I, C106A, C46A, and C53A. Each of these is a point mutation. The cDNA changes would be the specific positions, like M26I at position 26, and C106A at position 106. The protein changes would be the amino acid substitutions: M26I (met to isoleucine) and C106A (cysteine to alanine). 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other mutations. The paragraph mentions other PD-associated mutations but focuses on the specific ones discussed here. The key is to extract the gene, the mutations, their positions, and the effects. 

The user's example shows how to structure the JSON with Gene, variants, each having cDNA and protein changes. So I need to structure the response accordingly. 

Check if there are any other mutations mentioned. The text says "other PD-associated point mutations are less clear" but the specific ones mentioned are M26I, C106A, C46A, C53A. The C106DD is a different mutant, but that's not mentioned in the context here. 

So the extracted information should include the gene DJ-1, the specific mutations with their positions and effects. The answer should be in the JSON format as per the example, with the variants array containing each mutation's details.
