Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a paragraph from a medical literature abstract and wants to know if it contains mutation-related information. The goal is to extract specific details about mutations if they exist, otherwise return "N.D.".

First, I need to read through the abstract carefully. The main focus here is on PINK1 mutations in PARK6, which is a form of Parkinson's disease. The abstract mentions that PARK6-related mutations do not affect the dimerization of PINK1 or its associated complexes. It also talks about mutant PINK1 leading to mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis deficits, proteasome dysfunction, and increased a-synuclein aggregation.

Looking for specific mutation details: The text mentions "PARK6 related mutations do not affect this dimerization..." but doesn't specify the exact mutations. The part about mutant PINK1 causing deficits is mentioned, but again, no specific mutation description is given. The example in the user's prompt shows that when a mutation is mentioned with a specific cDNA change and protein change, it's extracted. However, in this case, the text doesn't mention any specific mutations, just general effects of mutations on PINK1.

The abstract does mention that PARK6 mutations are related to the dimerization and complexes, but there's no specific mutation described. The term "mutant PINK1" is used, but without the exact cDNA change or protein alteration, it's not enough to classify as a mutation in the context of the example. The user's example requires specific mutations with cDNA and protein changes, which aren't present here.

So, even though the text mentions mutations in the context of PARK6, it doesn't provide the specific details like cDNA changes or protein alterations. Therefore, the correct response would be "N.D." because the mutation information isn't explicitly stated with the required details.
