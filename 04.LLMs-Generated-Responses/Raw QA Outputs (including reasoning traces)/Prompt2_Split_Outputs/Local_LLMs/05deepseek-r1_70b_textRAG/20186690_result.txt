Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given text. Let me read through it carefully.

First, the text mentions the ABI 3730 automated DNA sequencer and HGVS recommendations, which are related to genetic sequencing and mutation nomenclature. That suggests there might be mutation data here.

Next, it talks about the cDNA numbering starting at the initiation codon, which is relevant for identifying mutations. The text then says, "Out of the 59 variants, only data from p..." but it cuts off. So there are 59 variants, but the details are incomplete.

Moving on, it discusses sequencing the LRRK2 gene in 90 young onset and familial PD patients. They found 59 coding variants, which were analyzed in another cohort. The methods used include MALDI-TOF, which is a technique for genotyping.

However, the text doesn't provide specific information about the mutations themselves, such as their cDNA changes, protein changes, or detailed descriptions. It focuses more on the methodology and the number of variants rather than the specific mutations.

So, based on this, while the text is about genetic analysis and variants, it doesn't include the specific mutation details required. Therefore, the extracted information for mutations would be "N.D." across the board.
