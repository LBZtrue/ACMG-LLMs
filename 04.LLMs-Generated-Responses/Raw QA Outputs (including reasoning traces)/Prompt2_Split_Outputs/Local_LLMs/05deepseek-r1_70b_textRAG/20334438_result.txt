Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given text has any mutation information. Let's look at the context provided. The text talks about protein identification using databases like HPRD and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. It mentions peptide hits, spectra, and fragmentation annotations in the Supporting Information. There's a mention of false positive rates and manual inspection of single peptide hits.

Hmm, I'm scanning for keywords like "mutation," "cDNA change," "protein change," or any specific gene variants. The text discusses excluding peptides from the background and those with unreasonable fragmentation, but that's about protein identification, not mutations.

I don't see any terms that directly relate to mutations, such as specific gene names with changes in their cDNA or protein sequences. There are no descriptions of any mutations or their effects mentioned here. It's all about the methodology of protein identification using mass spectrometry data and databases.

So, based on this, the text doesn't contain any mutation-related information. Therefore, I should return "N.D." for all the fields related to mutations.
