Alright, I need to extract mutation-related information from the provided text. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through the context and abstract to identify any mutation terms. I see mentions of specific mutations like E46K, A30P, and A53T in the αS gene. These are all missense mutations associated with Lewy body diseases.

Next, I'll note the gene involved, which is clearly stated as the αS gene. Now, looking at each mutation:

1. **E46K**: This refers to a change at position 46 where glutamic acid (E) is replaced by lysine (K).
2. **A30P**: At position 30, alanine (A) is replaced by proline (P).
3. **A53T**: At position 53, alanine (A) is replaced by threonine (T).

Each mutation is described as causing autosomal dominant LBD in several kindreds. The context also mentions that these mutations accelerate αS aggregation, leading to disease.

I'll structure this information into the specified JSON format. For each variant, I'll include the cDNA and protein changes, and a brief description from the context. Since the transcript isn't specified, I'll use "N.D." there.

Finally, I'll ensure all fields are complete and accurately represent the data from the text.
