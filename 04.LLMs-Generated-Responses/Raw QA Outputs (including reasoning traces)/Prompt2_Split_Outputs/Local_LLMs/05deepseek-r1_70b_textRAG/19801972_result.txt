Okay, I need to extract mutation information from the given text. Let's read through it carefully.

First, I see a mention of "Arg275Trp" in exon 7. That's a protein change where arginine (Arg) at position 275 is replaced with tryptophan (Trp). 

Looking for the gene name, it's associated with the p53 gene because the discussion is about p53 mRNA levels and mutations related to familial Parkinson's disease (AR-JP). So the gene is TP53.

The cDNA change isn't explicitly provided, so I'll note that as "N.D.".

The protein change is clear: p.Arg275Trp. 

The description in the context is the mutation in exon 7, specifically the missense mutation Arg275Trp.

Putting it all together, I'll structure this information in the required JSON format, making sure all fields are filled or marked as "N.D." where necessary.

```json
{
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "Arg",
                "alt": "Trp",
                "position": "275"
            },
            "Description in input context": "heterozygous missense mutation Arg275Trp in exon 7"
        }
    ]
}
```
