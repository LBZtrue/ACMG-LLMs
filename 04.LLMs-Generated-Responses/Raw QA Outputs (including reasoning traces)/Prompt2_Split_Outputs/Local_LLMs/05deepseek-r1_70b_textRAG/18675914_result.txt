Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a set of literature excerpts and wants me to extract mutation information in a specific JSON format. My role here is to act as a professional medical literature data mining expert. 

First, I need to read through the provided text carefully to identify any mentions of mutations. Let's start with the abstract. It talks about LRRK2 being a gene that, when mutated, causes Parkinson's disease. So, the gene in question is LRRK2. I should note that down.

Moving on to the next paragraph, it mentions the Y1699C mutant gene. That's a specific mutation where tyrosine (Y) at position 1699 is changed to cysteine (C). So, I have the protein change here. I need to check if there's a corresponding cDNA change. The paragraph also refers to deletion mutants but doesn't specify the exact cDNA or protein changes for them. It mentions that the excision sites were sequenced, but without more details, I can't extract specific cDNA changes for those mutants.

Looking at the last paragraph about PAGE and Western blotting, it doesn't provide any mutation information, so that's irrelevant for this task.

Now, putting it all together, I have the gene name as LRRK2 and one variant with the protein change Y1699C. Since the cDNA change isn't provided, I'll mark it as "N.D." in the JSON. The description in the context is "Y1699C mutant gene."

I should structure this information according to the specified JSON template, ensuring all fields are present and using "N.D." where information isn't available. That way, the user gets a complete and accurate extraction as per their requirements.
