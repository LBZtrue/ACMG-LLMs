Alright, I need to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify any mentions of mutations.

In the first paragraph, I notice the term "heterozygous W437X mutation." This seems like a specific mutation. The gene isn't explicitly mentioned here, but from the context, it's related to PINK1, as that's the main focus of the abstract.

Looking at the Materials and Methods section, I see mentions of G309D and L347P mutations. These are clearly stated, and again, they relate to PINK1 since the discussion is about the PINK1-TRAP1 pathway.

In the abstract, there's a mention of mutations in the PINK1 gene causing an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's disease. This ties the mutations to the PINK1 gene.

So, the mutations identified are W437X, G309D, and L347P, all in the PINK1 gene. Each of these mutations has specific cDNA and protein changes. For example, G309D refers to a change in the DNA at position 309 from G to D, and similarly for L347P.

I should structure this information into the specified JSON format, ensuring each mutation is listed with its respective details. For any missing information, like the transcript in cDNA Change, I'll use "N.D." as per the instructions.

Now, I'll put all this together into the JSON structure, making sure each field is correctly filled and no information is omitted.
