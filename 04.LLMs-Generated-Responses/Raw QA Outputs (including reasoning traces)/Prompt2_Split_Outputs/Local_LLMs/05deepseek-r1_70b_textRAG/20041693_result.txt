Alright, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given paragraphs. Let's start by reading through the context and the question carefully. 

The context mentions RS variants, specifically 0P, E46K, and A53T. It talks about expressing these from recombinant plasmids using Quikchange mutagenesis and PCR. The FDA synthesized primers, and DNA sequencing confirmed the mutations. 

Looking closer, the question is about whether the literature contains mutation info. It does, so I need to extract details. The first paragraph lists the variants: 0P, E46K, A53T. Wait, but 0P isn't standard notation. Maybe it's a typo for A30P? Because later in the context, A30P is mentioned. So I think 0P should be A30P.

Next, I need to structure this into JSON. The gene isn't specified, so that's N.D. For each variant, I need cDNA Change, Protein Change, and Description. 

For A30P: cDNA position isn't given, so transcript and position are N.D. The protein change is from A to P at position 30. The description is "A30P RS". Similarly, E46K: protein ref E to K at 46. Description "E46K RS". A53T: A to T at 53, description "A53T RS".

I should make sure the JSON includes all variants and their respective details, using N.D. where info is missing.
