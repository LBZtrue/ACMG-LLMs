Alright, so I need to extract mutation-related information from the provided text. Let me read through the text carefully.

First, I notice the context mentions several mutants: G2019S, I2020T, and R1441C. These are specific mutation names, so they're relevant.

Looking at the figures, Fig. 1 is described as LRRK2 directly interacting with and phosphorylates Akt1. This suggests that LRRK2 is the gene involved. The mutants mentioned are likely variants of this gene.

In the Introduction, it's stated that LRRK2 is responsible for autosomal-dominant PD, PARK8. This confirms the gene is LRRK2.

Now, for each mutation:
- G2019S: cDNA change would be c.2019G>A, protein change p.G2019S.
- I2020T: cDNA c.2020T>C, protein p.I2020T.
- R1441C: cDNA c.1441C>T, protein p.R1441C.

Each of these is a variant under the LRRK2 gene. Since the text doesn't specify the transcript used, I'll put "N.D." for the transcript in each variant.

I need to structure this into a JSON format with the gene and each variant's details. I'll make sure each variant includes cDNA and protein changes, and the context description.

I think that's all the mutation info present. Time to format it properly.
