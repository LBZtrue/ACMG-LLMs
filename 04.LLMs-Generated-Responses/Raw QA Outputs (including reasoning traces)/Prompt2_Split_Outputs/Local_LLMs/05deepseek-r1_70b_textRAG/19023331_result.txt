Alright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided several paragraphs from a medical literature context and wants to extract mutation-related information. My role is to act as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. 

First, I'll read through each paragraph carefully. The first paragraph mentions "rent oligonucleotide sequences" and details about siRNA and cloning. Nothing about mutations there. The second paragraph discusses cell culture and transfections, again no mutation info. 

The third paragraph talks about deletions associated with a loss-of-function phenotype and mentions missense mutations but doesn't specify any particular mutations. It also discusses TRAF and TTRAP proteins interacting with DJ-1. The fourth paragraph is about cDNA synthesis and qPCR, no mutations there either.

So, none of the provided paragraphs explicitly mention specific mutations, like gene names, cDNA changes, or protein changes. Therefore, the extracted information should reflect that with "N.D." for all fields.
