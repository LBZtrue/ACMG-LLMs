Okay, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. 

First, the abstract mentions Alpha-Synuclein (α-syn), which is a protein associated with Parkinson's disease. It specifically talks about three missense mutations: A30P, A53T, and E46K. These mutations are linked to familial PD, which is a rare autosomal dominant form. So, I know the gene involved is SNCA since α-syn is the protein it codes for.

Looking at each mutation: A30P means alanine at position 30 is replaced by proline. Similarly, A53T is alanine at 53 replaced by threonine, and E46K is glutamic acid at 46 replaced by lysine. I don't see any mention of cDNA changes, so those fields will be N.D.

I need to structure this into a JSON format as per the example. Each variant will be an object under the "variants" array. For each variant, I'll note the protein change and the description from the text. Since the gene isn't explicitly named in the context, I have to infer it as SNCA because α-syn is the protein.

I should make sure that all required fields are present, using "N.D." where information isn't provided. So, the final JSON should have the gene as SNCA and each mutation listed with their protein changes and descriptions.
