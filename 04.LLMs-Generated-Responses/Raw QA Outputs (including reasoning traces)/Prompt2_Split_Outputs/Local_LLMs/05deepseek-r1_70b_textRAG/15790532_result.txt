Okay, so I need to extract mutation information from the given paragraphs. Let me read through the context and the abstract first.

The context mentions a major deletion of the first five exons causing loss of gene function and another mutation, L166P, which affects protein stability. Then, the abstract talks about mutations in the DJ-1 gene linked to Parkinson's disease, and they've analyzed several mutations and polymorphisms. The main mutations mentioned are L166P, which they've previously studied, and they're expanding to include others like R98Q, A104T, D149A, and M26I.

Looking at the next paragraph, they expressed these DJ-1 variants in M17 cell lines. R98Q, A104T, and D149A have similar protein levels to wild-type, but L166P is barely detectable, and M26I has low levels. This suggests that while some mutations don't affect protein levels, others like L166P and M26I do.

So, the gene involved is DJ-1. The variants listed are R98Q, A104T, D149A, and M26I. Each of these has specific protein changes. For each variant, I'll need to structure the cDNA and protein changes. Since the context doesn't specify the cDNA changes, I'll mark those as N.D., but the protein changes are given.

Putting it all together, I'll create a JSON object with the gene as DJ-1 and an array of variants. Each variant will have their respective cDNA and protein changes, along with the description from the text. I'll make sure to include all four variants and fill in the details as per the information provided, using N.D. where necessary.
