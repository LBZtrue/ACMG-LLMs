Alright, I'm going to try to figure out how to extract the mutation information from the given text. Let me start by reading through the provided context and question carefully.

First, the context includes an abstract and some figures related to LRRK2 mutations in Parkinson's Disease. The abstract mentions that autosomal dominant mutations in the LRRK2 gene are a common cause of PD. Then, looking at the figures, Figure 1a and 1b seem to discuss certain mutants, like the D motif mutant, which is insufficient in MAPKKK binding. There's also mention of phosphorylation levels and the use of specific antibodies.

The question is asking me to act as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert. My role is to extract information related to mutations from the provided paragraphs. I need to check if the text contains mutation information and, if so, extract details like gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. If any of these aren't mentioned, I should use "N.D."

Looking at the abstract, it specifies that mutations in LRRK2 are the focus, so the gene is clearly LRRK2. Now, I need to check for specific mutation details. The abstract doesn't provide specific cDNA changes or protein changes, just that there are autosomal dominant mutations. However, the figures might have more details.

In Figure 1a and 1b, they mention a D motif mutant. The D motif is part of the protein structure, so this likely refers to a protein change. The exact cDNA change isn't provided, nor are the positions. The description in the context is "D motif mutant insufficient in MAPKKK binding," which I can include as the mutation description.

Since the cDNA change details like transcript, position, ref, and alt aren't specified, I'll mark them as "N.D." Similarly, the protein change has the position and ref alt as "N.D." because the text doesn't provide specific amino acid positions or changes, just the motif.

So, putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the gene as LRRK2 and the variant details, filling in what's available and using "N.D." where information is missing.

```json

    "Gene": "LRRK2",

            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",

            },
            "Description in input context": "D motif mutant insufficient in MAPKKK binding"
        }
    ]
}
```
