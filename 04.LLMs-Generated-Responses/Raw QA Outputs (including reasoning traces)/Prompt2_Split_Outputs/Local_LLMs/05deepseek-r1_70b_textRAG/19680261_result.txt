Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. The user has provided a paragraph from medical literature and a specific question about extracting mutation information. My task is to act as a professional medical literature data mining expert to analyze the given text.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully. The paragraph mentions "parkinson's disease patients harboring distinct parkin mutations (56)." So, the key terms here are "parkinson's disease," "parkin," and "mutations." This indicates that the literature does discuss mutations, specifically in the parkin gene associated with Parkinson's disease.

Next, I need to extract the relevant details. The sentence explicitly states "parkin mutations," so the gene involved is "parkin." However, the text doesn't specify particular cDNA changes, protein changes, or detailed descriptions of the mutations beyond mentioning their presence. Therefore, for those fields, I'll use "N.D." as per the instructions.

Now, structuring the extracted information into the required JSON format. The gene is clearly "parkin," and under variants, since there are no specific changes mentioned, each sub-field (cDNA Change, Protein Change, Description) will be "N.D." except for the mention of mutations in the description.

I should ensure that no fields are omitted and that the JSON is correctly formatted. Let me double-check to make sure all necessary parts are included and that I'm following the example provided by the user.

Lastly, I'll present the JSON as the formal answer, ensuring clarity and adherence to the specified structure.

```json
{
    "Gene": "parkin",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "distinct parkin mutations"
        }
    ]
}
```
