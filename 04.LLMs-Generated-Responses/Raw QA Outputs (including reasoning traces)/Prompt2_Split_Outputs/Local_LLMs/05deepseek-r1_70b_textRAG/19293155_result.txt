Alright, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given text. Let's start by reading through the text carefully.

First, I see mentions of DJ-1 and M26I mutation in Figure 6. That's a clear indicator of a mutation. The text also talks about site-directed mutagenesis using a plasmid and primers, which suggests they're introducing specific mutations.

Looking for gene names, DJ-1 is explicitly mentioned, so that's the gene. Now, for the variants, I need cDNA change, protein change, and description.

The protein change is given as M26I, which translates to Methionine at position 26 being replaced by Isoleucine. That's a specific amino acid substitution, so the protein change is p.M26I.

The cDNA change isn't explicitly provided, so I'll have to note that as N.D. Similarly, the transcript isn't mentioned, so that's also N.D. The position for the protein change is 26, which is clear.

The description in the context is the M26I mutation itself, as seen in Figure 6. So, I can put that in the description field.

I don't see any other mutations mentioned, so this seems to be the only one. I need to structure this information into the specified JSON format, making sure all fields are present even if some are N.D.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the Gene as DJ-1 and a single variant with the protein change details and description. Everything else not mentioned is filled with N.D.

I should double-check that I haven't missed any other mutations or details. It looks like this is the only mutation discussed in the provided text. So, I'll proceed to format the answer accordingly.

```json

    "Gene": "DJ-1",
    "variants": [
        {

            },
            "Description in input context": "M26I mutation"
        }
    ]
}
