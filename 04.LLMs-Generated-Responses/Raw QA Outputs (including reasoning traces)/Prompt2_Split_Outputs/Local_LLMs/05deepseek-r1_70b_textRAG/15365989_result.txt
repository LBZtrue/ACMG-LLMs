Alright, I'm going to tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a passage from medical literature and is asking me to extract mutation-related information. My role is to act as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, so I need to carefully analyze the text.

First, I'll read through the provided passages to identify any mention of mutations. The user has given me three paragraphs. The first discusses the use of Transgenomic for exon screening and direct sequencing. The second talks about analyzing signs of movement disorders. The third describes mutation analysis using dHPLC technology and outlines the patient demographics.

Looking for keywords like "mutation," "variant," "cDNA," "protein change," or specific gene mentions (like TP53 in the example), I notice that the third paragraph does mention investigating the DJ1 gene for mutations. However, upon closer inspection, it doesn't provide specific details about the mutations found, such as cDNA changes or protein changes. It only states that they used dHPLC technology to screen the exons.

Since the text doesn't include specific mutation information, I can't extract any gene variants or changes. Therefore, according to the guidelines, I should return "N.D." for all fields. This means there's no detailed mutation data present in the provided context.

I also need to ensure that the JSON structure is correct, with all necessary fields included and "N.D." where information isn't available. So the final output will reflect that no specific mutations were described in the text.

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "N.D."
        }
    ]
}
