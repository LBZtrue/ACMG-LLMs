Okay, so I need to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraphs. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify any terms related to mutations.

First, I notice mentions of "homozygous non-sense W437X PINK1 mutation." That's a clear indication of a mutation in the PINK1 gene. The W437X refers to the protein change where tryptophan (W) at position 437 is changed to a stop codon (X). The cDNA change isn't explicitly provided, so I'll note that as "N.D."

Next, there's a discussion about mitochondrial genes ND5 and ND6. The ND5 mutation is described as T21A, meaning threonine (T) at position 21 is replaced with alanine (A). Similarly, ND6 has an N119D mutation, where asparagine (N) at position 119 is changed to aspartic acid (D). Both of these are missense mutations and are homoplasmic. Again, the cDNA changes for these aren't mentioned, so I'll mark them as "N.D."

I should structure the extracted information into the specified JSON format. Each gene will have its own entry with the relevant details. For the PINK1 mutation, it's a non-sense mutation, so the protein change is from W to X at position 437. For ND5 and ND6, their respective protein changes are T21A and N119D, both missense mutations.

I need to ensure that all fields are included, even if some information isn't available, using "N.D." where necessary. I'll make sure each mutation is listed under the correct gene and that all details are accurately captured as per the text.

Finally, I'll compile the information, making sure the JSON is correctly formatted and that each variant is properly described within its respective gene entry.
