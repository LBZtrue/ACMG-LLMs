Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given literature text. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

First, I see that the text mentions several mutations: G309D, A383T, G411S, Y431H, W437X, N451S, Q456X, and C575R. These all seem to be related to a gene, but the text doesn't explicitly state which gene. However, from the context, it's talking about PINK1 because it's mentioned earlier in the expression plasmids section. So, I can infer that these mutations are in the PINK1 gene.

Each mutation is listed, but there's no information about the cDNA changes. The mutations are given in protein change format (like G309D), which tells me the amino acid change but not the specific DNA nucleotide change. So, for the cDNA Change section, I'll have to put "N.D." for all fields except maybe the position, but since the position isn't specified in the cDNA context, I'll leave that as "N.D." too.

Looking at the Protein Change, each mutation specifies the reference and alternate amino acids and their positions. For example, G309D means glycine (G) is replaced by aspartic acid (D) at position 309. So, for each variant, I'll extract the ref, alt, and position from the protein change.

I also notice that the text doesn't provide descriptions for each mutation beyond their names, so the "Description in input context" will just be the mutation itself as it appears in the text.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the Gene as PINK1 and each variant listed with their respective protein changes and the cDNA changes marked as "N.D.".
