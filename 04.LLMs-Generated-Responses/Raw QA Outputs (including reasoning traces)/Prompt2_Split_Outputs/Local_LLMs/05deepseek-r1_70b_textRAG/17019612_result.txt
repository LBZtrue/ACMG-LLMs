Alright, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given text. Let me start by reading the text carefully.

The text mentions that DNA was extracted from blood samples and mutations were screened using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with the Sequenom system. It refers to previous studies by Tan et al. (2006) for the method. Then, it talks about multiplex genotyping assays designed with Sequenom DESIGNER software.

Moving on, the text mentions the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. It states that this mutation accounts for 3-7% of familial PD and 1-3% in sporadic PD in several ethnic populations, with the highest prevalence in North Africans and Ashkenazi Jews. It cites several studies for this information: Skipper et al. 2005a, Di Fonzo et al. 2005, Gilks et al. 2005, Kachergus et al. 2005, and Lesage et al. 2005.

So, the mutation mentioned is G2019S in the LRRK2 gene. The cDNA change isn't explicitly stated, so I'll note that as N.D. The protein change is given as G2019S, which means glycine (G) is replaced by serine (S) at position 2019.

Now, I'll structure this information according to the specified JSON format. The gene is LRRK2, and under variants, there's one entry. The cDNA change has transcript, ref, alt, and position, all set to N.D. except position which is 2019. The protein change has ref as G, alt as S, and position as 2019. The description is "G2019S mutation" as mentioned in the text.

I need to make sure I don't include any information not present in the text. The text doesn't specify the cDNA change, so I leave those fields as N.D. Similarly, the variant is only one, so the variants array has a single object.

I think that covers all the necessary information. Let me put it all together in the JSON format as specified.

```json

    "variants": [

            },
            "Description in input context": "G2019S mutation"
        }
    ]
}
