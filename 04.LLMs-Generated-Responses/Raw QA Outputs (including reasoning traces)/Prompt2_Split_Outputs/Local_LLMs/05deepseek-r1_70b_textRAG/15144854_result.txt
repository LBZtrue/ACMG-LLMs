Alright, I need to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

I notice the mention of a patient, IX-51, from the Contursi kindred, who has a confirmed A53T α-syn mutation. The literature references (Golbe et al., 1990; Polymeropoulos et al., 1997) are cited, which probably discuss this mutation in more detail.

Looking for specific mutation details, the text explicitly states the A53T mutation. This refers to a change in the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene where alanine (A) is substituted with threonine (T) at position 53.

I'll break this down:
- Gene: SNCA (since α-syn is the protein, SNCA is the gene)
- cDNA Change: The position is 53, but the exact cDNA change isn't provided, so I'll note it as N.D.
- Protein Change: p.A53T, which means alanine (A) to threonine (T) at position 53.

I don't see any other mutations mentioned, so I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring all fields are included with "N.D." where information is missing.
</think>

```json
{
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",

                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "T",
                "position": "53"
            },
            "Description in input context": "A53T α-syn mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```
