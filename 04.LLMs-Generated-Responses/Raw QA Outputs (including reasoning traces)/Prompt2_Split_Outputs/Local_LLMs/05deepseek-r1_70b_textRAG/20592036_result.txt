Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract mutation information from a given text. First, I'll read the context carefully. The text mentions PD-associated mutants A30P, E46K, and A53T. These are specific protein changes. 

I need to identify the gene, but it's not explicitly mentioned here. Since the mutations are in the alpha-synuclein protein, which is encoded by the SNCA gene, I'll note that as the gene.

Next, looking at each mutation: A30P means alanine at position 30 is replaced by proline. Similarly, E46K is glutamic acid to lysine at 46, and A53T is alanine to threonine at 53. I'll structure these as separate variants in the JSON.

The context doesn't provide cDNA changes, so those fields will be N.D. Each variant's description is clearly stated in the text, so I'll include those as well.

Putting it all together, the JSON should list the gene as SNCA and each variant with their respective protein changes and descriptions, leaving cDNA fields as N.D. where necessary.
