Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given literature context. Let me read through the context carefully. 

The context mentions "Mutational analysis of the patient's mtDNA" and shows a human mtDNA map with specific single nucleotide changes (SNCs). It talks about two mutations: m.14319T>C and m.12397A>G, located in the ND6 and ND5 genes, respectively. 

So, the genes involved are ND6 and ND5. The cDNA changes are given as m.14319T>C for ND6 and m.12319A>G for ND5. Wait, looking again, it's m.12397A>G for ND5. 

The protein change for ND6 is N119D, as the mutation prediction shows the transmembrane topology with the N119D mutation. For ND5, the protein change isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll mark that as N.D. 

The descriptions in the context are "m.14319T>C" for ND6 and "m.12397A>G" for ND5. 

I need to structure this into the JSON format, ensuring all fields are present and using "N.D." where information isn't provided. Let me make sure I get the positions right: m.14319T>C is position 14319, and m.12397A>G is position 12397. 

So, each variant will have its own entry in the variants array, with the respective gene, cDNA change details, protein change if available, and the description from the context. 

I think that's all the necessary information. Now I'll format it according to the specified JSON structure.

```json
{
    "Gene": "ND6",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "T",
                "alt": "C",
                "position": "14319"
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N",
                "alt": "D",
                "position": "119"
            },
            "Description in input context": "m.14319T>C"
        }
    ]
}
```
