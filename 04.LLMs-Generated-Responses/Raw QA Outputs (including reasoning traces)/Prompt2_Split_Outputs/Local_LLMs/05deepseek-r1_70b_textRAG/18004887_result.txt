Okay, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given text. Let's start by reading the text carefully.

First, the context mentions "R42P mutation" and "K48A mutation" in the Ubld domain. These are specific protein changes. I should note the gene, but it's not explicitly mentioned, so I'll put "N.D." there.

Looking at the figures and experiments, they discuss the R42P mutation causing destabilization and the K48A affecting interaction with the proteasome. I'll extract each mutation separately, including their descriptions.

I'll structure the JSON with the gene as "N.D.", and each variant will have cDNA and protein changes. Since cDNA info isn't provided, those fields will be "N.D." except for the protein details which are given.

I'll make sure each variant includes the description from the text. Finally, I'll format everything according to the specified JSON structure.

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "R",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "42"
            },
            "Description in input context": "R42P mutation destabilizes the domain leading to its complete unfolding and thereby disrupting substrate and/or proteasome interactions."
        },
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",

                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "K",
                "alt": "A",
                "position": "48"
            },
            "Description in input context": "K48A mutation retains the Ubld but likely leads to a modified interaction with the S5a subunit of the proteasome."
        }
    ]
}
