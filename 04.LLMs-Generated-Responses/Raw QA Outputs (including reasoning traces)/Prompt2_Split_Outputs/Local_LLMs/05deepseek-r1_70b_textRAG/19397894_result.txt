Alright, I'm looking at the user's query where they want me to extract mutation information from a given text. The text mentions mutations in the LRRK2 gene, specifically G2019S and I2020T. 

First, I'll identify the gene, which is clearly LRRK2. Then, I'll look for the specific mutations. G2019S is described as having higher kinase activity, and I2020T has lower activity.

I need to structure this into the specified JSON format. For each mutation, I'll note the cDNA and protein changes. Since the transcript isn't mentioned, I'll use "N.D." there. 

I'll also include the description from the text for each mutation. This way, the output captures all the necessary details accurately, even where some info isn't provided.
