Alright, I need to figure out how to approach this user's query. They provided a detailed context about extracting mutation information from medical literature. The user wants me to act as a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, so I should focus on accurately identifying and extracting mutation details.

First, I'll read the given context carefully. The context mentions mutations in DJ-1, specifically M26, R98, D149, and a mutation from leucine to proline. It also talks about how these mutations affect the structure of DJ-1, like disrupting dimer formation.

Next, I need to extract the gene name, which is DJ-1. Then, look for cDNA and protein changes. The context doesn't provide specific cDNA changes, so I'll note that as "N.D." for each variant.

For protein changes, each mutation is described. M26 is a methionine at position 26, R98 is arginine at 98, and D149 is aspartic acid at 149. The leucine to proline mutation isn't assigned specific positions, so I'll describe it as L to P without a position.

Each variant's description in the context is mentioned, like "M26, R98, and D149 are located at..." and the leucine to proline causing a break in the helix.

I'll structure this information into the specified JSON format, ensuring all fields are included and using "N.D." where necessary. It's important to be precise and only extract what's explicitly stated to meet the user's requirements.
