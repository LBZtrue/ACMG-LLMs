Okay, so I need to figure out if the given text has any mutation information and extract the details if it does. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

First, I see mentions of Parkin mutants: FLAG-Parkin(R42P) and FLAG-Parkin(C289G). These are specific mutants, so that's a good sign. 

Looking at the text, in part (E), it says "Quantification of the relocation of Parkin mutants to mitochondria." So the study is looking at how these mutant forms of Parkin move to the mitochondria. 

I'll break down each mutant. R42P means that at position 42, the amino acid arginine (R) is changed to proline (P). Similarly, C289G is a change from cysteine (C) to glycine (G) at position 289.

The gene is Parkin, which is well-known in Parkinson's disease research. The cDNA changes aren't explicitly mentioned, so I'll note that as N.D. The context is about mitochondrial relocation, which ties into mitophagy and neurodegenerative diseases.

So, putting it all together, I have two variants under the Parkin gene. Each variant has a protein change, with the cDNA details not provided. The description includes both mutants and their effect on mitochondrial relocation.
