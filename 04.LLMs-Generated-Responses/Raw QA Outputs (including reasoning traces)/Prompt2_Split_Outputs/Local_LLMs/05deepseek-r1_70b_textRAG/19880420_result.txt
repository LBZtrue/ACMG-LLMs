Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature text. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best to follow the steps provided.

First, I'll read through the text carefully. The text mentions "genic mutations R42P and G430D that have impaired cytoprotective capacity." So, I know mutations are involved here. The gene in question isn't explicitly stated, but from the context, it's likely referring to the PINK1 gene since the surrounding text talks about PINK1 and parkin.

Next, I need to break down the mutations. R42P means that at position 42, the amino acid arginine (R) is changed to proline (P). Similarly, G430D means at position 430, glycine (G) is changed to aspartic acid (D). 

Now, looking at the cDNA changes, the text doesn't provide specific cDNA information, so for the transcript, ref, alt, and position, I'll use "N.D." as instructed. For the protein changes, I can fill in the ref and alt based on the mutations given.

Putting it all together, the gene is PINK1, and the variants are R42P and G430D with the protein changes as identified. Since there's no cDNA information, those fields will be "N.D.".

I think that's all the relevant information I can extract based on the provided text and the guidelines.
