Alright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a paragraph from medical literature and wants me to extract mutation-related information following a specific JSON format. My role is a Professional Medical Literature Data Mining Expert, so I need to carefully parse the text.

First, I'll read through the provided context. I see mentions of two mutations: G309D and L347P. The G309D is referenced from Valente et al., and the L347P is noted as prevalent in the Philippines. Both seem to affect protein stability.

Looking at the structure, the example given in the query helps. I need to extract gene name, variants with cDNA and protein changes, and descriptions. In the example, they used "TP53" as the gene. However, in the provided text, the gene isn't explicitly mentioned. I'll have to note that as "N.D.".

For the variants, each mutation needs its own entry. Starting with G309D, the cDNA change isn't specified, so transcript, ref, alt, and position are all "N.D." The protein change is G309D, so ref is G, alt is D, position is 309. The description is "G309D mutation".

Next, L347P. Again, no cDNA info, so those fields are "N.D." Protein change is L347P, so ref is L, alt is P, position is 347. Description is "L347P mutation".

I should ensure that each variant is in its own object within the variants array. Also, check if there are any other mutations mentioned, but I only see these two.

I need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted, with proper braces and commas. All non-mentioned fields are filled with "N.D." as per the instructions. No additional information should be added beyond what's in the text.

So, putting it all together, the JSON structure should accurately reflect the extracted data without any speculation or added information. I'll double-check each field to ensure accuracy.
