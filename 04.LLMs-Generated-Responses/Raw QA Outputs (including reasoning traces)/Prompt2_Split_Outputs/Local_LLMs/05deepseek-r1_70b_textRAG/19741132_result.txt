Okay, so I need to extract mutation information from the given medical literature context. Let me go through the text step by step. 

First, I see the abstract mentions mutations in the LRRK2 gene, specifically noting that G2019S is the most common variant. It also points out that in Asia, another variant, G2385R, occurs more frequently. So that's two mutations right there: G2019S and G2385R in the LRRK2 gene.

Looking further into the figures, Figure 3 is described as showing that exposure to rotenone accelerates DA degeneration in LRRK2 G2019 and G2385R mutant flies. This confirms that these two variants are being studied in the context of dopamine neuron degeneration when exposed to rotenone, a common Parkinson's disease model.

Next, in the paragraph about rotenone treatment, it again mentions that challenging transgenic LRRK2-expressing flies with rotenone examines the susceptibility of DA neurons to degeneration. This reinforces that the G2019S and G2385R mutations are key in this study.

I don't see any other genes or mutations mentioned in the provided text. So, I'll focus on LRRK2 with these two variants. 

For the JSON structure, I'll list LRRK2 as the gene. Each variant will have its cDNA and protein changes. Since the cDNA change isn't explicitly provided beyond the protein level, I'll mark the transcript as N.D. and use the given protein changes. The descriptions will match how they're presented in the text.
