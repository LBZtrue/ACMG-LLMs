Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to extract mutation information from a given medical literature text. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The user provided some figures and a results section from a study on alpha-synuclein mutations. The figures mention specific mutants like E46K and A53T, which are known to cause disease, and some artificial ones like E46A, E83A, and A83K. The results section talks about studying these mutations.

My role here is to extract specific details about these mutations. I'll look for gene names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and any descriptions provided. I notice that the gene in question is alpha-synuclein, abbreviated as SNCA.

Looking at the variants, the first one is E46K. The protein change is from glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K) at position 46. The cDNA change isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll mark that as N.D. The description says it's a disease-causal mutation.

Next is A53T, another disease-causal mutation. The protein change is alanine (A) to threonine (T) at position 53. Again, no cDNA info, so N.D. there.

The third variant is E46A, an artificial mutation. Protein change is E to A at 46. No cDNA info, so N.D.

Fourth is E83A, another artificial mutation. Protein change is glutamic acid (E) to alanine (A) at 83. No cDNA info.

The last variant is A83K. Wait, the figure mentions E83K, but the results say A83K. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I'll go with what's in the results, so it's alanine to lysine at 83. No cDNA info again.

I need to structure all this into the specified JSON format. Each variant gets its own entry with cDNA and protein changes, and a description. For missing info, I use "N.D.".

I think that's all the relevant data. I should make sure the JSON is accurate and complete, without any omissions. Double-checking everything to ensure I didn't miss any mutations or mislabel anything.
