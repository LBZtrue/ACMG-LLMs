Alright, I need to extract mutation information from the provided medical literature paragraphs. First, I'll look for any mention of specific mutations. 

In the first paragraph, I notice "R42P" and "A46P" are mentioned as disease-causing mutations. These are specific protein changes. The context also refers to "I44A," but it's described as part of the beta-pleated sheet, not a mutation. So, I'll focus on R42P and A46P.

Next, I'll check for the gene associated with these mutations. The paragraph doesn't explicitly mention the gene name, but from the context, it's discussing Parkin and UBL domain interactions, so I can infer that the gene is Parkin (GeneID: 5071).

Looking for cDNA changes, the text doesn't provide specific cDNA information for these mutations, so I'll mark that as "N.D." in the JSON output.

The protein changes are clearly stated: R42P and A46P. Each refers to the substitution of amino acids at specific positions. 

The description in the context includes both mutations and their effect on the beta-pleated sheet, which might affect Parkin recruitment. I'll include this in the description field.

I'll structure the extracted information into a JSON format, ensuring all required fields are present, even if some are "N.D." since the user expects a complete structure.

Finally, I'll verify that only mutation-related information is included and that no data is fabricated or assumed beyond what's explicitly stated.
