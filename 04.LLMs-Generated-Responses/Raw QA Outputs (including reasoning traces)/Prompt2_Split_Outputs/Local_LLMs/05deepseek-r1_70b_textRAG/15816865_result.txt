Alright, I'm going to tackle this data extraction task step by step. First, I need to read the provided context carefully to identify any mutation-related information. The context discusses Parkinson's disease (PD), specifically mentioning that several genetic mutations are involved in familial cases. It highlights the analysis of 22 parkin point mutants, which include missense and nonsense mutations.

So, the gene in question here is "parkin". The context doesn't provide specific cDNA changes like nucleotide positions or alterations, so I'll note that as "N.D." for the transcript, ref, alt, and position fields. Similarly, there are no specific protein changes mentioned, so those fields will also be "N.D.".

The mutation description is given as "parkin point mutants", which I'll include in the description field. Since there are 22 mutants analyzed, I'll mention that in the notes. I need to ensure the JSON structure is correctly followed, with all required fields present and "N.D." used where information isn't available.

Finally, I'll compile the extracted information into the specified JSON format, making sure it's accurate and complete based on the context provided.

```json
{
    "Gene": "parkin",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Description in input context": "parkin point mutants"
        }
    ]
}
