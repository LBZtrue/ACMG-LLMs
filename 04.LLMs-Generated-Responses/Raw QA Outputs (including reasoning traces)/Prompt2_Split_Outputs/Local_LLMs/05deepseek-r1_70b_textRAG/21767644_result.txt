Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature context. The user is asking me to act as a professional medical literature data mining expert. My task is to check if the provided text has any mutation-related information and then extract the relevant details in a specific JSON format.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions that mutations in the N-terminus of the gene encoding α-synuclein (α-syn) are linked to autosomal dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). So that's important. It specifically points out that mutations are in the N-terminus region of the α-syn gene.

Next, I should check the introduction part. It states that all described point mutations within the α-syn gene lead to familial PD, citing Krüger et al., 1998, and Polymeropoulos et al., 1997. This indicates that the α-syn gene is associated with these mutations, but the exact cDNA and protein changes aren't detailed here.

Looking further, in the context provided, there's a mention of A30P α-syn expression in a mouse brain study. The abstract part (B) talks about the A30P mutation. So, the specific mutation here is A30P, which refers to an alanine (A) at position 30 being replaced by proline (P).

Now, I need to structure this into the JSON format as per the example. The gene is α-synuclein. The variant is A30P. For the cDNA change, the transcript isn't specified, so I'll put "N.D." The reference allele is A, alternative is P, but wait, in the mutation nomenclature, the position is usually for the protein change. So the protein change is at position 30, ref A, alt P.

I think the cDNA change isn't provided, so I'll leave that part as N.D. except for the position if it's implied. But since it's a protein-level mutation, the cDNA might be c.88G>C or something, but that's not given, so I'll just put N.D. for the transcript, ref, alt, and position.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the Gene as "SNCA" (which is the gene symbol for α-synuclein), and under variants, one object with cDNA Change and Protein Change. The description is "A30P α-syn".

I should make sure that all fields are present, using "N.D." where information isn't available. So, that's how I arrived at the JSON structure in the answer.

```json
{
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "A",
                "alt": "P",
                "position": "30"
            },
            "Description in input context": "A30P α-syn"
        }
    ]
}
```
