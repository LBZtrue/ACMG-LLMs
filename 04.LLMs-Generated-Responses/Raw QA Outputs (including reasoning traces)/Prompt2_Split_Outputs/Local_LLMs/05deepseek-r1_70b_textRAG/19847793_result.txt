Okay, I need to help the user extract mutation information from the provided medical literature text. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll read the input text carefully to spot any mention of mutations, genes, cDNA changes, or protein changes.

Looking at the text, I see "c.203-204GC4" and "p.D525N" in exon 8. These seem to indicate specific mutations. The gene involved here is PINK1, as mentioned in the context.

Next, I'll break down the information. The cDNA change is described as "c.203-204GC4", which I can parse into transcript, ref, alt, and position. Since the transcript isn't specified, I'll note it as "N.D." Similarly, the protein change is "p.D525N", so the ref is D, alt is N, and position is 525.

I also need to provide a description as it appears in the text. The mutations are referred to collectively at position "x" as c.203-204GC4, so I'll include that in the description.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the gene as PINK1 and the variants array containing the specific changes. Any missing information, like the transcript, will be filled with "N.D.".

Finally, I'll ensure the JSON format is correct, with proper nesting and all required fields present. This way, the user gets a complete and accurate extraction of mutation data as per their requirements.
