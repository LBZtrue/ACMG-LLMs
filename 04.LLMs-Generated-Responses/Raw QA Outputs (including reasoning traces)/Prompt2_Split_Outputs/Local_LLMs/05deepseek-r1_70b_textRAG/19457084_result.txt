Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given text. The user has provided a detailed prompt about their role as a professional medical literature data mining expert, and they want me to analyze a specific paragraph to extract mutation-related data.

First, I should read the provided paragraph carefully. It mentions the A30P and A53T mutations of α-synuclein. A30P is described as enhancing the stability of α-synuclein against proteasomal degradation, while A53T doesn't have a significant effect. There's also a mention of an E46K mutation, but the text cuts off, so I don't have details on that.

Now, looking at the JSON template, I need to structure the information under "Gene" and "variants". Each variant should have "cDNA Change", "Protein Change", and "Description in input context".

For the A30P mutation:
- Gene is α-synuclein.
- cDNA Change: The position is 30, ref is A, alt is P. Transcript isn't mentioned, so it's N.D.
- Protein Change: Same as cDNA since it's a single amino acid substitution.
- Description is as stated in the text.

For A53T:
- Similar structure, but the effect is different; no significant effect is mentioned.
  
E46K is mentioned, but there's no description provided, so I can't extract details for it. Since the user wants all variants listed, I should include it even if some fields are N.D.

I need to make sure each variant is an object within the variants array. Also, any missing information should be marked as "N.D.".

So, putting it all together, the JSON should list α-synuclein with three variants: A30P, A53T, and E46K. Each with their respective cDNA and protein changes, and descriptions where available.
