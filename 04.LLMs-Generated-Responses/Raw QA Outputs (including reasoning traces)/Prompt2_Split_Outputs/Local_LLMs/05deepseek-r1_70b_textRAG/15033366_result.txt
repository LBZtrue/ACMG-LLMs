Okay, so I need to extract mutation information from the given text. Let's start by reading through the text carefully. 

The text mentions several mutants: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6. Each of these has specific changes. For example, D2 has residues 2-41 deleted, D3 has residues 43-56 deleted, D4 has residues 56-102 replaced by Glu, and so on. 

I notice that the gene in question is hAS, as mentioned in the context. The mutations are described with their respective residue changes. Now, I need to structure this information into the specified JSON format. 

Each variant should have a "cDNA Change" and a "Protein Change," but since the text doesn't provide cDNA information, I'll mark those as "N.D." The protein changes are clearly stated, so I'll include those. 

I'll list each mutant under the "variants" array, making sure each entry has the necessary fields filled with the available data and "N.D." where information is missing.
