Alright, I need to extract mutation-related information from the provided text. Let me first read through the text carefully to spot any mutation terms.

I see "I93M mutation" mentioned in the context of UCH-L1 and its effect on secretion. This indicates a specific mutation point at position 93, where isoleucine (I) is replaced by methionine (M). 

Looking for gene name, it's UCH-L1. The cDNA change isn't explicitly stated, so I'll mark that as "N.D." Similarly, protein change details beyond the position and amino acids aren't provided, so those fields will also be "N.D.".

The description is clearly given as "I93M mutation," so that goes into the description field. 

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should include the gene, a variants array with each variant having cDNA and protein changes, and the description. Since some details are missing, I'll fill those with "N.D." to maintain the structure.
</think>

```json
{
    "Gene": "UCH-L1",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "I",
                "alt": "M",
                "position": "93"
            },
            "Description in input context": "I93M mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```
