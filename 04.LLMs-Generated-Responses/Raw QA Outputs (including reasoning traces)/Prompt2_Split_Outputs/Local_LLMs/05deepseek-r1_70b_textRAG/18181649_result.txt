Okay, so I need to extract mutation information from the given text. Let me read through the text carefully.

First, I see mentions of DJ-1 mutations. In the context section, there's a mention of PD-associated missense mutations, specifically L166P, A104T, A104V, E163K, R145E, M26I, and M26L. These are all point mutations in the DJ-1 gene.

Looking at the abstract, it starts by talking about missense mutations in DJ-1. It specifically mentions L166P and notes that it disrupts homodimerization and causes poor folding.

In the methods section under "DJ-1 is destabilized by each PD-associated missense mutation," it lists the mutations A104T, A104V, E163K, E163K/R145E, M26I, and M26L. These were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing.

I need to structure this information into the specified JSON format. Each mutation should be a variant within the "variants" array under the "Gene" DJ-1.

For each mutation, I'll list the cDNA change. Since the text doesn't specify the transcript or the exact cDNA position, I'll put "N.D." for those. The protein change will include the reference and alternate amino acids and their positions.

I'll also include a description field to capture how the mutation is described in the text, which in this case is the mutation itself.

I should make sure not to include any mutations that aren't explicitly mentioned. For example, R145E is mentioned in the combination E163K/R145E, but I'll treat them as separate mutations since both are listed.

Double-checking each mutation to ensure they're all included correctly. That should cover all the necessary information without adding anything extra.
