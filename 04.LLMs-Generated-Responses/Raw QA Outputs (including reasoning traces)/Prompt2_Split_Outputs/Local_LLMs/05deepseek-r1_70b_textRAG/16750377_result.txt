Okay, I need to extract mutation information from the given paragraphs. Let's look at the context and the abstract provided.

In the context, there's a mention of "Y1699C" mutation, which is linked to dardarin-positive inclusions. The abstract talks about mutations in the LRRK2 gene causing Parkinson's disease, and mutations are found throughout the gene, including the kinase domain. The study investigates if kinase activity is important for the damaging effects of these mutations.

So, the gene involved is LRRK2, coding for dardarin. The mutations are in different domains, including the kinase domain. The specific mutation mentioned is Y1699C, which is a protein change. There's no mention of cDNA changes, so that part should be "N.D."

Putting it together, the JSON should have the gene as LRRK2, and under variants, one object with the protein change Y1699C. Since cDNA isn't mentioned, it's "N.D." The description is the mutation itself, "Y1699C."

I need to make sure all fields are filled, even if some are "N.D." That way, the JSON is complete as per the template.

```json
{
    "Gene": "LRRK2",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "Y",
                "alt": "C",
                "position": "1699"
            },
            "Description in input context": "Y1699C"
        }
    ]
}
```
