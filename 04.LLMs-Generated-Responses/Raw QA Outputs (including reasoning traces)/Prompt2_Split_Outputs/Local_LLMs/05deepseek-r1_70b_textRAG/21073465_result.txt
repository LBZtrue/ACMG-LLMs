Okay, I need to figure out how to extract mutation information from the given medical literature text. The user has provided a specific JSON format they want the answer in, so I should make sure to follow that closely.

First, I'll read through the provided text carefully. The text mentions the introduction of the Y1699C mutation in the COR domain. That's a clear mutation point. The gene isn't explicitly stated here, but in the context of LRRK2, which is a common gene associated with such mutations, it's a reasonable inference.

Looking at the text, I see "Y1699C" which refers to a tyrosine (Y) at position 1699 being changed to cysteine (C). So, for the protein change, ref is Y and alt is C at position 1699. The cDNA change isn't directly provided, so I'll note that as N.D. for both transcript and position.

The description in the context is given as "Y1699C mutation," so I'll include that. The rest of the fields like Gene and other variant details can be filled in accordingly, with N.D. where information is missing.

I should structure this into the JSON format as specified, ensuring all fields are present and correctly filled. Also, I need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted without any syntax errors.

```json
{
    "Gene": "N.D.",
    "variants": [
        {
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": "N.D.",
                "ref": "N.D.",
                "alt": "N.D.",
                "position": "N.D."
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": "Y",
                "alt": "C",
                "position": "1699"
            },
            "Description in input context": "Y1699C mutation"
        }
    ]
}
```
