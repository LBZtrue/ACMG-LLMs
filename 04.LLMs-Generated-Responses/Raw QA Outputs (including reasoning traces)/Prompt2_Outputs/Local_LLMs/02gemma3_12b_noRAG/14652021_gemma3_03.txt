Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate the JSON output. Here's the JSON based on the provided text. I'm going to assume that the text provided is the list of cited publications as detailed in the prompt. Since no text was provided, I'm going to proceed with sample data, but **please replace this with the actual content from the provided literature.** I'm including the assumptions I'm making within the generated JSON.

**Important Notes & How to Use This Answer:**

1.  **Replace Sample Data:**  The data above is a placeholder. You *must* replace it with the information extracted from the actual text you provide.
2.  **HGVS Standardization:** I'm assuming you're using a known reference sequence. If the HGVS nomenclature is not standardized in the original text, use a tool like Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) to get the standardized nomenclature.
3.  **MONDO ID Retrieval:**  Use the MONDO database ([https://www.mondo-ontology.org/](https://www.mondo-ontology.org/)) to find the correct MONDO ID corresponding to the "Described Disease."
4.  **Assumptions & "N.D."**:  If some information is *not* present in the literature, mark it as "N.D." (Not Determined).
5.  **Source of Thresholds**: Be sure to note the source of the "Threshold for normal readout" and "Threshold for abnormal readout." If it's from the original literature, state it as such. If you're determining it based on your own knowledge, state that it is based on custom standards.
6.  **Iterative Process**: Extracting information and organizing it in this way is often an iterative process. You might need to go back and revise your extraction as you get a better understanding of the text.
7. **Multiple Experiments:** If multiple experiments were done, use multiple entries within the "Experiment Method" array.
