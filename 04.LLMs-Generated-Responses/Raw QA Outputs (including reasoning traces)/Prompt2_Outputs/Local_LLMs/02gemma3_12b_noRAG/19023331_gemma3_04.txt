**Explanation of Choices and Assumptions:**

*   **Variant Standardization:** I assumed the correct transcript ID (NM\_001126112.3) for the TP53 gene based on the given example.  In a real-world application, you would need to use a variant annotation tool to ensure accuracy.
*   **Molecular Effect:** I assumed "partial loss-of-function" based on the description, but a more comprehensive analysis would be required to confirm this.
*   **Source of Thresholds:** The example provided used "Literature" as the Source, which I followed.
*   **MONDO Term:** I retained the example MONDO term (MONDO:0012345) for Hereditary Myopathy. A thorough search in the MONDO database would be needed in a practical situation.
*   **Approved Assay**: Assumed Yes based on the prompt's initial example.
