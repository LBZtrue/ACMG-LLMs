Okay, here's the JSON output based on the provided literature text.  Since no actual literature was provided, I'm constructing an example based on common experimental methodologies and incorporating the requirements.  I'm providing a plausible scenario to demonstrate the entire process.  I'm also using placeholder values where specific data is missing from a hypothetical literature source.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

*   **Assumed Gene & Variants:** I'm using ATP2B1, a gene associated with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, and generating hypothetical variants.
*   **MONDO Term:** I looked up a plausible MONDO term related to Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD1A).
*   **Replicates:** I'm assuming biological and technical replicates were performed and include descriptions.
*   **Controls:** Included positive and negative controls.
*   **Thresholds:** I've created reasonable thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts.
*   **Molecular Effect:**  I'm hypothesizing the molecular effects of each variant.
*   **Data Source:**  Remember that in a real-world scenario, this data would be extracted from the actual scientific paper.  My JSON provides a plausible example.
*   **API Integration:**  The HGVS nomenclature would be standardized through an API like NCBI's or another relevant bioinformatics resource.  This JSON presents the *output* of that standardization.

To use this, you would replace the placeholder values with the *actual* data from your source literature.
