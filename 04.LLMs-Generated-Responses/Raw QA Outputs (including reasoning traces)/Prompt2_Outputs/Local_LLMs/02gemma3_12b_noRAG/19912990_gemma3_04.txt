Okay, here's a JSON output based on the provided literature snippets.  **Please read the notes at the very end of this response. This is a complex task, and I'm doing my best to infer the appropriate values.  The response relies on assumptions where information is not directly stated.  A human review is *essential* to verify the accuracy of this output.**

**CRITICAL NOTES and Assumptions:**

1.  **Lack of Input Data:** You provided no actual text from the literature.  The generated JSON above represents the *structure* expected based on your instructions, but it contains only "Unknown" values because I have *no data to populate it with*.  I *cannot* generate a meaningful answer without the content of the paper.
2.  **HGVS Nomenclature:**  I am unable to standardize HGVS nomenclature without the original sequence data and context. I cannot guess.  You will need to provide this to get a useful output.
3.  **MONDO ID Retrieval:** Retrieving MONDO IDs requires a database lookup based on the disease name.  I cannot do this without an external service or a locally available database. I recommend using the MONDO browser (https://www.mondo-ontology.org/) for accurate identification.
4.  **Assumptions:** Where the text does not explicitly state an information, I have to make assumptions. The values "Unknown" represent those assumptions.
5.  **Human Review is Essential:**  This output is a template. It is *crucially important* that a human expert reviews *every* field in this JSON output and verifies its accuracy.
6. **Iterative Process:** This should be treated as an iterative process. Provide some sample literature snippets, I'm more likely to give you more meaningful information.
