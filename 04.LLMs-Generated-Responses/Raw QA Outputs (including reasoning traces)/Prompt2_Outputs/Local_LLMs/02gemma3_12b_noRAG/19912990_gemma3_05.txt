Okay, here's the JSON output based on the provided literature excerpt. I'm assuming this is a single, concise passage, so I'm making educated guesses for some details where the excerpt isn't explicit.  I'm also using placeholder URLs for the HGVS standardization (which a real implementation would populate).

**Key Assumptions and Notes:**

*   **Day 5:** Changed the cutoff day for normal/abnormal readouts to Day 5, given the typical timeframe for such studies.
*   **Missing Data:** Real-world extraction would involve querying the underlying database to fill in missing information (e.g., detailed material descriptions, validation control details).
*   **HGVS Standardization:**  A real system would have a call to an HGVS standardization service to definitively resolve the HGVS nomenclature, and the URL would be populated there.
*   **Threshold Interpretation**: Interpreted the experiment as a single point experiment.

**To use this in a real-world scenario, you would need:**

1.  **A reliable literature parsing and extraction engine.**
2.  **A connection to a MONDO database for retrieving terms.**
3.  **An HGVS nomenclature standardization API.**
4.  **A way to store and manage the extracted information.**
