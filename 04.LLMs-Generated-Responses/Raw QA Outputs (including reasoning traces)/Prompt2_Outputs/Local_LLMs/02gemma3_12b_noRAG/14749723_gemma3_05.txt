Okay, I'd be happy to process the provided text and generate the JSON output. However, I require the original literature text you are referring to in order to complete the task. Please provide the text content of the scientific paper, article, or abstract so I can extract the relevant information and fulfill your request accurately.

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  **Identify Variants:**  Extract gene names, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS Nomenclature:**  Use online resources to ensure the HGVS nomenclature is correctly formatted.
3.  **Identify Disease and MONDO Term:**  Determine the disease under study and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term.
4.  **Extract Experimental Details:**  Gather information about assays, materials, readouts, replicates, controls, statistical methods, and thresholds.
5.  **Construct JSON Output:** Assemble all the data into the structured JSON format you specified.

I'm ready to begin once you provide the text.
