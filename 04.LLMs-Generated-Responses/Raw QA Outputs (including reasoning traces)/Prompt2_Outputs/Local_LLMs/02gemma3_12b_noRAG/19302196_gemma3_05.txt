Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. However, you haven't provided any actual literature content. I need the text of the scientific paper or study you want me to analyze. 

**Please provide the text of the document you're referring to. Once you give me the text, I will follow your instructions precisely and provide the JSON output as described.**

I'm prepared to do the following once you provide the content:

1.  **Extract Variant Information:** Identify genes, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS Nomenclature:** I'll need access to an HGVS nomenclature database or API to perform the standardization.  I can use a local resource, or if you specify a preferred one, I can try to integrate it (depending on the API availability).
3.  **Identify Disease and Get MONDO Term:** I'll search the text for mentions of diseases and use a search engine or MONDO API (if available) to retrieve the corresponding MONDO term.
4.  **Extract Experimental Details:** I'll carefully extract all details about experimental methods, materials, readouts, replicates, controls, and statistical analysis.
5.  **Determine Assay Approval:**  I'll assess whether the methods are generally accepted for studying the identified disease.
6.  **Generate JSON Output:** I'll organize the extracted data into the specified JSON format.

**Waiting for your input text!**
