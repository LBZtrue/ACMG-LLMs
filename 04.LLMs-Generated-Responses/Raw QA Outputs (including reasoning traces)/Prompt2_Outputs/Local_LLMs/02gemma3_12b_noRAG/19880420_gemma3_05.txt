Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Please provide the text of the scientific paper or excerpt you want me to analyze. I'm prepared to follow the detailed instructions and workflow you're outlined, including:

1.  **Variant Extraction & Standardization:** Identify genes, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.  I will then attempt to standardize the HGVS nomenclature using established databases and tools.
2.  **Disease Identification & MONDO Term Retrieval:** Identify the disease being studied and find its corresponding MONDO ID.
3.  **Experiment Method Detail Extraction:**  Carefully extract information regarding materials, readouts, replicates, controls, statistical analysis, and thresholds.
4.  **JSON Formatting:**  Organize all extracted data into the provided JSON structure.

**I'm waiting for you to provide the text.**  Once you do, I will begin the analysis and present the structured JSON output.
