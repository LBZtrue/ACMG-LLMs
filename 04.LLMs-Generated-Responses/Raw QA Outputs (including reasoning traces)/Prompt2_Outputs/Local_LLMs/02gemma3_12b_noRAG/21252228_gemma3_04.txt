Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since no literature has been provided, I will generate a response based on the prompt's instructions and a hypothetical scenario using elements from the prompt's example.

**Hypothetical Literature Snippet (for demonstration):**

"We investigated the impact of the c.1234A>T variant in the *SMN1* gene, suspected of contributing to Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). This variant causes a frameshift and premature stop codon. Using patient-derived fibroblasts, we performed RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. A control cell line, HEK293, expressing wild-type SMN protein, was used as a positive control. Empty vector served as a negative control.  RT-qPCR revealed a 60% reduction in *SMN1* transcript levels.  Western blot showed a corresponding decrease in SMN protein expression in cells carrying the variant (approximately 40% compared to controls). Three biological replicates were performed, and each sample was analyzed in duplicate for Western blotting. A t-test was used to determine statistical significance."

**Important Considerations:**

*   **No Provided Literature:** I’m simulating with a made-up snippet. Provide the literature for a real extraction.
*   **HGVS Standardization:** The example assumes a standard HGVS nomenclature.  I’m relying on a basic understanding; an automated process would need specialized tools.
*   **MONDO Term:**  I've assigned a placeholder MONDO term for SMA. A proper lookup using a database would be required.
*   **Missing Information:** The made-up snippet leaves out several details (like precise controls). I’ve filled gaps based on reasonable assumptions.
*   **N/A Values:** Where information isn't provided, I'm using "N/A" (Not Applicable).

To get accurate and specific information, please provide the literature you want me to analyze.
