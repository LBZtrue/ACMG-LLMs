Okay, I'm ready. Let's process the provided text. Here's the JSON output based on the text you provided (which is just the list of papers and no actual functional experimental data). I'm providing a *skeleton* structure because I don't have the data to populate it.  I've included placeholders where details would need to be filled in from the papers themselves. **Important:** This is a *template*. You're going to need to replace the "Placeholder" text with information extracted from each paper.

```json

**Explanation and How to Use:**

1. **Placeholder Replacement:**  For *each* paper you want to process, copy this JSON template.  Then, systematically replace all the "Placeholder" text with the actual information from the paper.  Be meticulous.
2. **Multiple Experiments:** If a single paper describes multiple experiments, you'd create a new "Experiment Method" entry within the main JSON structure for *each* experiment.
3. **MONDO Retrieval:**  You're responsible for retrieving the correct MONDO term. Use the MONDO database (searchable online) to find the appropriate term for the "Described Disease."
4. **HGVS Standardization:** If the paper uses a preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., "c.XXXXG>A"), use the appropriate HGVS standardizer to get the correct format. I can help you do this if you provide the preliminary nomenclature.
5. **Thresholds:** Carefully analyze the papers to determine what constitutes "normal" and "abnormal" results. If the paper doesn't explicitly state thresholds, you're expected to use your knowledge of the field to determine reasonable cutoffs.  State that in the "Source" field.
6. **"Approved Assay":**  This field requires you to assess whether the method described in the paper is a standard and accepted approach for studying the disease or related phenotypes.
7. **JSON Validation:**  After filling in the data, use a JSON validator (many online tools are available) to ensure that the JSON structure is correct.  Even a small typo (e.g., a missing comma) will invalidate the JSON.

**Example of partial filling with sample data:**

Let's say a paper mentions a variant in the *APP* gene. I'm giving the most accurate result I am able.
