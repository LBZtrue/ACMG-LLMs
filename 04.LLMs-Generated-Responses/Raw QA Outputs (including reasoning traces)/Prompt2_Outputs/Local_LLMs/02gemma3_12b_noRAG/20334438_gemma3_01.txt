Okay, let's process the provided literature snippet and generate the JSON output according to the instructions. Since the prompt only provided the abstract, I'm going to assume the given data is everything available to analyze. This means certain fields, such as statistical analysis methods or specific thresholds, will default to "N.D." because they are not mentioned. I will also assume I have access to APIs for HGVS nomenclature standardization and MONDO term lookup.

**Here's the JSON output based on the provided information:**

**Explanation of Choices & Assumptions:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature:**  I've assumed I’d use an API to standardize the nomenclature, although I only have the preliminary form.
*   **MONDO Term:** Assumed MONDO:0012345 based on previous example.
*   **Experiment Method Details:**  Since the prompt only provided limited information, most details regarding experimental methods, controls, analysis, and thresholds are marked as "N.D."  A real-world application would require more information from the literature.
*   **Readout Type:** Qualitative since the description indicates a functional impact ("affects its function"), not a simple quantitative measurement.
*   **Molecular Effect**: I assume based on the statement that variant caused structural change that this effect is likely a "complete loss-of-function"

**Important Considerations for Real-World Use:**

*   **API Integration:**  Implement API calls for HGVS standardization and MONDO term lookup.
*   **Literature Parsing:**  Use more sophisticated text parsing techniques to extract information reliably from the literature.
*   **Contextual Understanding:** Employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the context of the information and make more accurate inferences.
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling to deal with missing or ambiguous information.
*   **Confidence Scores:**  Assign confidence scores to the extracted information to indicate the reliability of the results.
