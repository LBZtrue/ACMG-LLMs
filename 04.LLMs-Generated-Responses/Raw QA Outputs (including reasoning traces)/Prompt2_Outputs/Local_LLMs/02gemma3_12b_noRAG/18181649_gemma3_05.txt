Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate a JSON output based on the instructions. However, you haven't provided the text from the literature!  **I need the text you want me to analyze.**

Please provide the relevant text.  Once you provide the text, I will perform the analysis and generate the JSON output.

**Example of what I need:**

"The study investigated the role of the TP53 gene in hereditary myopathy. A variant, c.248G>A (p.G83D), was found to reduce protein expression by 50% in HEK293 cells. Three biological replicates were performed, and each sample was run in triplicate.  Wild-type cDNA served as a positive control, while an empty vector acted as a negative control.  ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 was considered normal, while less than 50% was deemed abnormal.  This technique is routinely used for studying protein expression in myopathy."

Once you supply the text, I will proceed and provide the structured JSON output.
