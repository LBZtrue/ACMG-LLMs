Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature and generate the JSON output. Please provide the text of the literature you want me to analyze. I will then follow the workflow and structure you've outlined.

**Important Considerations Before You Provide the Text:**

*   **API for HGVS Standardization:** I need access to an external API or library to properly standardize the HGVS nomenclature. Since I am a language model, I cannot execute external commands. I will *assume* that the provided HGVS nomenclature is already standardized for demonstration. If a specific API is desired, please specify it.
*   **MONDO Database Access:** Similar to HGVS standardization, I need a mechanism to query the MONDO database to retrieve terms.  For demonstration, I'm assuming access and will provide placeholder MONDO terms.  A real implementation would involve a database connection or API query.
*   **Assumptions & Custom Knowledge:**  If information is missing from the text, I'm likely to make educated assumptions based on the provided context and general biological knowledge. I will make sure to clearly indicate these assumptions when providing the JSON output.
*   **Volume of Text:** The complexity and accuracy of the output will depend on the clarity and amount of information available in the text. Very brief texts may lead to more assumptions.

Once you provide the literature, I will do my best to deliver a comprehensive and structured JSON response according to your specifications.
