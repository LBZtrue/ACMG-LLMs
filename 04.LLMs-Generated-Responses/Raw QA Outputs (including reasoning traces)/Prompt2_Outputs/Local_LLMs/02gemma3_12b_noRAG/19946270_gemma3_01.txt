Okay, here's the JSON output based on the provided text from the prompt. Since no actual literature was provided, I'm generating the output based on the information given in the prompt itself (the context and examples). This is to demonstrate the structure and content expected. I'm including placeholder data where specific details are missing.  I'm also making assumptions to provide a complete response, and those assumptions are noted.

**Important Considerations & Placeholder Notes:**

*   **No Literature Provided:** This is the most crucial point.  This JSON is *based on the prompt's context*. A real answer would require actual text from a scientific publication.
*   **Threshold for normal/abnormal readout**: Day 5 has been added as a reference.
*   **Specific Molecular Effects:**  The 'Molecular Effect' field can vary greatly depending on the variant and the specific assay performed.  More detail is needed from the original literature.
*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** The standardized HGVS nomenclature would require an API call or manual checking against a validated source if starting from non-standard notation.
*   **MONDO Term:** The MONDO term would need to be verified against the official MONDO database.
*   **Custom vs. Literature Thresholds:** In a real application, it's important to flag whether the normal/abnormal thresholds were derived from the literature or were custom-defined.
*   **More Experiments?**: The response only includes a single experiment type. Additional experiment method blocks may be present.

To get a truly useful response, please provide the full text of the scientific publication you're referencing.
