Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. **Please provide the text of the scientific literature you want me to analyze.**  I need the content of the paper to extract the information and generate the JSON output according to the specified format.

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Identify gene names and variants (including preliminary HGVS nomenclature).
2.  Standardize the HGVS nomenclature (I'm assuming I can use a standard online HGVS nomenclature converter if I need to; otherwise, provide instructions for standardization).
3.  Determine the disease studied.
4.  Extract details of the experimental method (materials, readouts, controls, etc.).
5.  Organize everything into a JSON object following the provided structure.
6.  Fill in "N.D." where data is unavailable or cannot be determined from the text.

I'm looking forward to working with you. Just paste the text of the paper when you're ready!
