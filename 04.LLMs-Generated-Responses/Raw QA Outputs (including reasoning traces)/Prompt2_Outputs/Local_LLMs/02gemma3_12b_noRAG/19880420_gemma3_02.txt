Okay, I'd like to process the provided text. However, you have provided instructions and examples but *not the actual literature* to analyze.  I need the text of the scientific paper/article to be able to perform the extraction and formatting.

Please provide the content of the paper or article, and I will then:

1.  Read the provided text.
2.  Extract the information as requested (variants, disease, experimental details).
3.  Standardize HGVS nomenclature (assuming a suitable API can be used - I'm going to assume a generic 'variant annotation API' for now).
4.  Look up the MONDO term if possible (again, assuming an accessible database/API for this, for now will assume I can look up the name and identify the term).
5.  Construct the JSON output as you's specified.

**Once you provide the literature, I'm ready to generate the JSON output.**
