Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since you haven't provided any actual literature yet, I will use the example data you included in the prompt and create the JSON output based on that. I'm creating an example JSON output using the data provided.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Provide Literature:** I need the actual text of the scientific literature you want me to process.  I can't do anything without it.
*   **API Integration (HGVS Standardization):**  I am *simulating* the HGVS standardization in this example. In a real implementation, I would need to integrate with an API (e.g., the Ensembl API or a similar resource) to accurately convert preliminary HGVS nomenclature to the standardized format.
*   **MONDO Retrieval:** In a live environment, I would need access to the MONDO database to retrieve the official term number corresponding to the disease name.  I'm hardcoding it here for the example.
*   **Customization:**  The fields within each section (e.g., "Molecular Effect," "Source" for thresholds) are based on the provided example.  You might need to adjust them to better fit the specific literature.
*   **Ambiguity:** Scientific literature can be ambiguous. I will do my best to interpret the information accurately, but human review of the extracted data is always recommended.

Once you provide the actual literature, I will process it and give you a more accurate JSON output.
