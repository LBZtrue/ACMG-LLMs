Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since you haven't provided the actual literature, I'm going to use the following scenario for illustration and generate a JSON output based on that.

**Scenario:**

The literature describes a study investigating the role of mutations in the *LAMA2* gene in Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2A (LGMD2A). Specifically, it details experiments using patient-derived fibroblasts to assess the impact of a novel missense variant, c.1234A>G (p.Met412Gly).  The method employed is a combination of qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis.  The researchers included positive and negative controls and performed three biological replicates per condition. The protein expression values for the mutant were found to be 30% compared to wild type. The authors conclude that the variant likely contributes to the pathogenicity of the disease.  The experiment is considered a standard approach for studying the impact of mutations in dystroglycanopathy genes.

**Important Notes:**

*   **MONDO Term:**  I used `MONDO:0004886` as the MONDO term for LGMD2A.  This is based on a common identifier. You may need to verify or adjust this based on the specific details of the literature.
*   **N.D. (Not Determined):** I used “N.D.” when information was not provided in the scenario.
*   **Assay Details:** The level of detail extracted depends on the information provided in the original literature.
*   **HGVS nomenclature standardization**:  I assumed the most appropriate transcript for HGVS nomenclature was NM_001172429.2 and standardized the format.
