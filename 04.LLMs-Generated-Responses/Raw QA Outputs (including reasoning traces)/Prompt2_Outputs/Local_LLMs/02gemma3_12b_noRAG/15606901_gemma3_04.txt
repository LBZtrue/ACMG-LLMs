Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Please provide the text of the scientific paper or relevant passage. I will then extract the information and format it into the JSON structure as requested.

Once you provide the text, I'm prepared to:

1.  **Identify Variants:** Extract gene names, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS:** Use a tool to standardize HGVS nomenclature (I will indicate what I use - if I can's do, I'll note it. I'm limited to basic formatting).
3.  **Determine Disease & MONDO:** Identify the disease studied and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term. I'll assume that I can use an external search for this.
4.  **Detail Experimental Methods:** Extract assay method, material used, readout type, biological/technical replicates, controls, statistical analysis, thresholds, and the "approved assay" status.
5.  **Construct JSON:** Assemble all extracted information into the specified JSON structure.

Looking forward to receiving the literature!
