Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. Since no text was provided, I will create a synthetic example based on the prompt's instructions and use that to generate the JSON output.

**Synthetic Literature Text (Example):**

"We investigated the role of a novel variant in the *SMN1* gene, c.287G>A, affecting splicing and leading to reduced SMN protein levels. This variant was found in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).  A Western blot analysis was performed using fibroblasts from affected individuals and healthy controls.  Three independent biological replicates were tested, each with duplicate samples (technical replicates).  Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control, and vector-only was the negative control.  The variant NM_000548.4:c.287G>A caused a significant reduction in SMN protein expression (approximately 60% of control levels, p < 0.01 using a t-test).  Validation controls included known pathogenic SMA mutations (n=2) and a known benign variant (n=1).  The levels of SMN protein were considered normal if they exceeded 70% of the mean control level, whereas levels below 50% were considered abnormal. This Western blot protocol is commonly used for assessing SMN protein levels in SMA diagnosis."

**Explanation and Considerations:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:** The synthetic example used a valid HGVS nomenclature.  In a real-world scenario, you would definitely need to use a dedicated API or software to ensure consistent and correct HGVS naming conventions.
*   **MONDO Term:**  I assigned a hypothetical MONDO term (MONDO:0000268) for SMA.  You would need to query the official MONDO database to retrieve the correct term.
*   **Protein Change:** The provided text did not mention a change in protein structure.
*   **Counts in Validation Controls** The original text mentioned the existance of a validation control, but did not specify a number.
*   **Missing Data:**  I've marked "N/A" where information was not provided in the synthetic text. Real data might require more nuanced handling of missing values.
*   **Customizability:** This is a template.  The key is to adapt it to the specifics of *your* literature and data.

To get accurate and useful results, please provide the actual text you want to process, and I will generate the JSON output based on that. Remember to specify any specific requirements or nuances for the process.
