Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Please provide the text of the literature you want me to analyze. I will then generate the JSON output following the specified format, including variant standardization (using a placeholder for now - actual API integration would be needed for full functionality), MONDO term retrieval (also requiring an external tool), and detailed experimental information extraction.

**Important Notes:**

*   **API Integration:**  I will include placeholders for the HGVS standardization and MONDO term retrieval steps. I don't have real-time access to external APIs, so those steps will be indicated as such. To complete those functions, you would need to integrate with a suitable API.
*   **Customization:**  The "Threshold for normal readout" and "Threshold for abnormal readout" will be populated based on either explicit descriptions in the literature or inferred based on generally accepted scientific standards.
*   **Completeness:** I will do my best to extract all relevant information, but the quality of the output depends heavily on the clarity and detail provided in the literature.
*   **Assumptions:** If the literature lacks certain information, I will mark those sections as "N.D." (Not Determined) and provide a brief explanation.

**Waiting for your input!  Please paste the text of the literature here.**
