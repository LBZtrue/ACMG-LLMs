Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. However, you're asking me to analyze a piece of literature which you haven't provided. I need the text of the scientific article to extract the necessary information and populate the JSON format you're requesting. 

**Please provide the text of the literature you want me to analyze. Once you provide the text, I will:**

1.  **Read and understand the context:** I will carefully examine the document to extract information about variants, disease, experimental methods, and results.
2.  **Standardize HGVS nomenclature:** I'm ready to use an HGVS nomenclature converter to standardize the variant descriptions, if necessary.
3.  **Retrieve MONDO terms:** I'm prepared to use a MONDO search tool to identify the corresponding MONDO terms for the disease.
4.  **Populate the JSON:** I will structure the extracted information into the requested JSON format.
5.  **Return the populated JSON.**

**In the meantime, I'm providing a placeholder JSON structure with example data to illustrate what the final output will look like *once I have the text of the literature to analyze.*  This is purely illustrative and *will not* reflect the content of any specific article.**
