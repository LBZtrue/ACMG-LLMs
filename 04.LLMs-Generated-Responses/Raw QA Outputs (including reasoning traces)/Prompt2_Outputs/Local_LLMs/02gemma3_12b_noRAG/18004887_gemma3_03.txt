Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Please provide the text of the scientific paper or abstract you would like me to analyze. I will then extract the requested information and format it into the JSON structure you're describing.

I'm prepared to:

*   Identify genes, variants (and standardize HGVS nomenclature), diseases, and experimental methods.
*   Retrieve MONDO IDs from the disease name.
*   Populate the JSON structure with details for each section.
*   Infer Molecular Effects and Thresholds if the literature doesn't explicitly state them (and note that I've inferred them in the "Source" field).

Just paste the text, and let's get started!
