Okay, let's process the provided literature (which is currently empty - I'm assuming you're providing a placeholder and will provide the actual text later). I will construct a JSON output structure that anticipates the expected data.  I'm including placeholder values and comments to guide the data entry when you provide the literature.  I will also provide placeholders for MONDO term retrieval.  **Please replace the bracketed comments and placeholder values with the actual information extracted from the literature.**

**Instructions & Key Points:**

*   **Replace Placeholders:**  Carefully replace all the bracketed comments and placeholder text with the actual information you extract from the literature.
*   **MONDO Retrieval:** Use the MONDO database link to find the appropriate term for the disease.
*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** Ensure the HGVS nomenclature is correctly formatted and standardized.
*   **Consistency:** Make sure the "Variant" entries in the "Readout description" section of the "Experiment Method" match the "Variants Include" section.
*   **Direct Quotes:** Whenever possible, use direct quotes from the literature for the "Description" fields to accurately represent the findings.
* **Detailed Descriptions**: The more details you can provide, the more informative the final JSON output will be.

I am ready to process the actual text when you provide it.  Please let me know if you have any questions!
