Okay, I'd be happy to process the provided literature and construct the JSON output as requested. The provided text only contains the specifications and instructions. I need the actual literature content to proceed.

**Please provide the text of the research article you're referring to.**

Once you provide the text, I will follow these steps:

1.  **Parse the text:** I'll carefully read and analyze the document to extract the necessary information.
2.  **Identify variants:** I'll pinpoint all mentioned genetic variants, noting their gene, preliminary HGVS nomenclature (if present), cDNA changes, and protein changes.
3.  **Standardize HGVS nomenclature:** I'll use a reliable database or online tool to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. (You may need to specify the preferred nomenclature system if you have one.)
4.  **Determine disease:** I'll extract the disease being studied and look up its corresponding MONDO term.  I will use a MONDO database query to obtain the official MONDO ID.
5.  **Extract Experimental Details:** I'll identify and describe any experimental methods used, including materials, readouts, replicates, controls, statistical analysis, and thresholds.
6.  **Evaluate Assay Approval:** I will make a reasoned determination of whether the methods are "Approved" based on context clues.
7.  **Construct JSON Output:** Finally, I will organize all the extracted data into a well-structured JSON format that precisely matches your specified schema.

I'm ready when you are! Just paste the text of the document.
