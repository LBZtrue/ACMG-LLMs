Okay, I'd be happy to process the provided literature to create the JSON output. Since you haven't provided the actual literature, I will use the information given in the prompt *as the entire input literature*. This will allow me to demonstrate the process and produce the JSON output according to your specifications.

Here's the generated JSON output based *solely* on the provided example in the prompt:

```json

        "Approved assay": "Yes"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

*   **Literature Dependence:**  The JSON output is *entirely* dependent on the input literature.  The more information you provide in the literature, the more detailed and accurate the JSON output will be.
*   **HGVS Standardization:** I used the provided naming convention. Actual HGVS standardization would require pulling from a database and might include more precision.
*   **MONDO Retrieval:**  In a real-world application, I would need access to a MONDO database API to automatically retrieve the term number based on the disease name.  I have placed a placeholder value.
*   **Threshold Determination:** If the literature does not mention explicit thresholds, I'm expected to use my own knowledge/experience to provide values in "Source: Custom" field, as in this case I have done.
*   **Structure:** This output adheres to the structure you provided in your prompt.
*   **Readout description** the readout description now contains the variant HGVS nomenclature
*   **"Approved Assay"**:  This determination would also require more context and potentially domain expertise to evaluate.  The prompt assumed 'Yes' for this example.

To get a specific and useful JSON output, please provide the actual content of the literature you want me to process.
