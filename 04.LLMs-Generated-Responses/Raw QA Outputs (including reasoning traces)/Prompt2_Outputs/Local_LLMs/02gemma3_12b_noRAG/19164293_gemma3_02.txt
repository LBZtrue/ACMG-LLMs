**Explanation of choices and assumptions:**

*   **Gene:**  UNC13A.
*   **Variant:** UNC13A c.1855G>A, p.A618T
*   **MONDO:** MONDO:0003349 (Congenital Myopathy).
*   **Assay Method:** Immunofluorescence Microscopy
*   **Custom Thresholds:** Since the original document didn't specify threshold values for the IF signal intensity for "normal" and "abnormal", the thresholds were assigned the value 'N/A' and the source was "Custom".  A real-world scenario would require defining these thresholds.
*   **P/LB and B/LB controls**: These validation controls were not performed according to the provided text.
*   **Statistical analysis method**: was 'N/A' due to lack of mention in the document.
*   **Description of material:** Added more detailed description of the material used.

**Important notes:**

*   This output is generated based solely on the provided snippets.  A complete literature review would likely provide more details for some fields.
*   The accuracy of MONDO term retrieval would depend on the accuracy of the search performed against the MONDO database.
*   The "Custom" designation for the readout thresholds means they need to be determined independently.
*   In a real application, the HGVS nomenclature standardization would be handled by an automated tool.  I provided the standard form here.
