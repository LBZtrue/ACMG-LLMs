Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate the JSON output. Please provide the literature text you want me to analyze. I'm waiting for you to paste the content. Once you provide the text, I'm prepared to do the following:

1.  **Extract Variant Information:** Identify genes, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS:** Utilize a suitable online tool (I will mention the tool I use in the explanation) to obtain the correctly formatted HGVS nomenclature.
3.  **Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term:** Locate the disease mentioned and use a search engine (like Google) in conjunction with a MONDO database search (https://www.mondo-ontology.org/) to find the associated MONDO term.
4.  **Detail Experimental Methods:** Extract information about the assays, materials, readouts, replicates, controls, statistical analysis, and thresholds.
5.  **Assess 'Approved Assay':** Determine if the method is generally used for the disease based on general knowledge and the context of the provided text.
6.  **Format as JSON:** Organize the data into the JSON structure you provided.

I look forward to receiving the text!
