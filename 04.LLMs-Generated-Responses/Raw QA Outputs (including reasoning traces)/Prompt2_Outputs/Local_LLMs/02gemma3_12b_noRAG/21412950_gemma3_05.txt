Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. However, you haven't provided any literature!  I need the text of the article(s) to extract the information and generate the JSON output.

**Please provide the text of the research paper you want me to analyze.  Once you provide it, I will follow your instructions to:**

1.  Identify variants and their descriptions.
2.  Standardize HGVS nomenclature (I will need access to a database for this and will assume it's available - if not, I'm limited to reporting what's in the text).
3.  Determine the disease of interest and its MONDO ID (again, I'm dependent on the text of the article).
4.  Extract experimental details, replicates, controls, and analysis methods.
5.  Generate the JSON output in the format you're requesting.

**In the meantime, I will provide a template JSON structure that I will populate when you provide the text. This is just the shell that I will customize based on your data.**
