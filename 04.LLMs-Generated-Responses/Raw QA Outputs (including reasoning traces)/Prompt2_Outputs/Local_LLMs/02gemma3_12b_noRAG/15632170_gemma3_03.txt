Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since you haven't provided the literature itself, I'll generate a JSON output based on the provided text describing the provided article. Here's the JSON output, based on the provided example and descriptions:

**Important Notes:**

*   **Replace with Actual Data:**  I have assumed the data, now you need to replace my example information with the actual extracted content from the source text.
*   **HGVS Standardization:** I'm assuming the provided HGVS nomenclature is correct. In a real-world application, you would need to use a reliable HGVS nomenclature standardization tool and API to ensure accuracy.
*   **MONDO API:** To accurately populate the "MONDO" field, you would need to use the MONDO API to search for the disease name and retrieve the corresponding term number.
*   **Custom Thresholds:** If the literature doesn't provide specific thresholds, you've instructed me to use a standard for normal and abnormal results. You need to be aware of and justify those custom thresholds if they are used.
*   **Complete Information:** To provide the most accurate JSON, providing the actual full text of the research article would allow me to extract the appropriate information and populate all fields.

Let me know if you can provide the source text, and I'll be happy to revise the response.
