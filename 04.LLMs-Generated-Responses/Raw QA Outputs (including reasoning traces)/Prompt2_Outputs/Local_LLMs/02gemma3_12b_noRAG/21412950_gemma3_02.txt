Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. **Please provide the text of the literature you want me to analyze.**

I will follow the workflow and JSON framework as outlined in the prompt, including:

1.  Extracting variant information (gene, HGVS, cDNA changes, protein changes).
2.  Standardizing HGVS nomenclature (I'm assuming access to an online nomenclature database or API for this; I'm unable to do that without it)
3.  Identifying the disease and retrieving the MONDO term.
4.  Detailing the experimental methods.
5.  Determining if the methods are commonly used.
6.  Organizing everything into the structured JSON output.

**I will do my best given the limitations of my current capabilities (primarily the inability to access external resources to standardize HGVS nomenclature).** I will note clearly where those limitations impact the results. Once you provide the text, I will generate the JSON response.
