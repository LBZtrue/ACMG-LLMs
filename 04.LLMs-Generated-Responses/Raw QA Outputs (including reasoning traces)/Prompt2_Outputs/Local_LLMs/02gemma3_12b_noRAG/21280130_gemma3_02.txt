Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. Since you haven't provided any literature to analyze, I will simulate the process using the provided example text and extend it to illustrate a more complex scenario.  I will create a sample literature excerpt and then generate the JSON output as requested.

**Sample Literature Excerpt (Simulated):**

"The study investigated the role of the *SMN1* gene in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). A novel missense variant, c.1234A>T (p.N412I), was identified in affected individuals.  Expression analysis using Western blotting in patient-derived fibroblasts revealed reduced SMN protein levels compared to healthy controls. This effect was observed across three independent biological replicates.  Technical replicates (n=3) were performed for each sample. A wild-type cDNA construct served as a positive control, while an empty vector was utilized as a negative control. Two pathogenic variants (c.986+1G>A, c.1175G>A) were used for validation. One likely benign variant (c.444G>A) was also included for comparison. The statistical significance of the differences was assessed using a two-tailed t-test (p<0.05).  Protein levels were considered normal if above 50% of the control mean. Levels below 30% were considered significantly reduced.  This Western blot methodology is a standard approach for assessing protein levels in SMA research."

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature:**  I'm assuming the HGVS nomenclature is the correct one. If there's a different system used, I would need to adjust. The same applies for mRNA and DNA sequences.
*   **MONDO ID:** I used MONDO:0009855, which corresponds to Spinal Muscular Atrophy.  You need to verify this is correct and replace it with the appropriate ID from the MONDO database if necessary.
*   **Thresholds:**  The thresholds for normal/abnormal readouts are based on the literature.  If the information isn't available, I'm filling in 'N.D.', signifying "Not Determined."  For custom values, I put "Custom" at the Source field.
*   **Real-World Application:**  In a real-world scenario, you would feed me the raw text of the literature, and I would parse it and extract this information.  I would need to be robust to variations in language and formatting.

To give you the most accurate JSON output, please provide the actual text you want me to analyze.  I can then apply more precise parsing and extraction.
