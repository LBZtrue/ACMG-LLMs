Okay, I'll process the provided literature (which is absent; I'm working based on the prompt's instructions and the hypothetical examples) and generate the JSON output.  Since there is no literature provided, I will create a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate the process.  Let's assume the following simplified literature snippet:

"This study investigated the role of the *MAPT* gene in Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). A novel variant, c.1234A>G (p.Lys412Gly), was identified.  The variant was introduced into cultured neuroblastoma cells.  Protein levels were quantified by ELISA. Three independent cell passages were used.  Each sample was assayed in duplicate. A control vector was used for comparison. The variant resulted in a 30% reduction in MAPT protein levels.  This finding is consistent with known pathogenic mechanisms in FTD. The analysis utilized a student’s t-test."

Here's the generated JSON output based on this hypothetical literature:

**Explanation and Key Considerations:**

*   **MONDO ID:** I'm using `MONDO:0005067` as the MONDO ID for Frontotemporal Dementia.  You're responsible for verifying this is the correct ID based on the specific literature and its definitions.
*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** I've assumed a transcript ID and standard HGVS notation.
*   **N.D.:**  "N.D." (Not Determined) is used where information is not present in the hypothetical literature.  This is important for accurately reflecting the data limitations.  You *must* replace these with real data when analyzing actual literature.
*   **Assumptions:** Several assumptions were made (e.g., regarding control groups, thresholds).  The real analysis needs to be based on direct statements from the original text.
*   **Customization:**  The structure and content of each field should be adapted based on the precise details of the literature you are analyzing.
*   **API for HGVS Nomenclature:**  For real-world applications, utilize a robust HGVS nomenclature converter API to ensure accurate and consistent notation.
*   **The code is just an example, the structure can be adapted for different requirements.**

**To properly use this response, please provide the actual literature that needs to be analyzed.  I will be happy to refine the JSON output accordingly.**
