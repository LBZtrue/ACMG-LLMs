Okay, let's process the provided literature excerpts and structure the information into the specified JSON format. Since there are no actual literature excerpts provided, I will create a *hypothetical* example based on a common scenario.  I'm making assumptions about data to fulfill the prompt's requirements. **Please replace these assumptions with real data from the actual literature you are working with.**

**Hypothetical Scenario:**

Imagine a study investigating mutations in the *SMN1* gene in individuals with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).  The study uses Western blots and mRNA expression analysis to assess the impact of the mutations. One mutation, c.255A>G (p.Lys85Glu), is identified.  The study includes biological and technical replicates and utilizes positive and negative controls. The study also identifies an mRNA transcript level change.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Replace the Hypothetical Data:** This is *critical*.  The example data is only a placeholder. Substitute it with actual data from your literature.
*   **MONDO Term Retrieval:** Use a tool or database to accurately retrieve the MONDO term for Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
*   **Threshold Determination:**  If thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren't explicitly stated, you're expected to determine them based on your knowledge or accepted standards in the field. Document this "custom" source.
*   **Validation Controls:** It's good practice to include validation controls, especially when characterizing novel variants.
*   **Readout Description:**  Provide as much detail as possible in the Readout Description section, explaining the experimental results in the context of the variant.
*   **Error Handling:** In real-world scenarios, you're expected to note any errors or unexpected results encountered during the experiment.
*   **Multiple Variants:** If multiple variants are being studied, create a separate entry in the "Variants Include" array for each variant.
