Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since no literature was provided, I'm creating a representative example based on the prompt and fulfilling the required structure. Let's assume the following (fictional) excerpt:

"We investigated the role of the *PINK1* gene in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Patient-derived fibroblasts carrying the c.754A>G variant (p.E252G) displayed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased oxidative stress.  A control group of wild-type fibroblasts exhibited normal mitochondrial function.  Three independent experiments were performed for each condition.  Western blot analysis confirmed decreased PINK1 protein levels in the mutant cells.  A plasmid containing wild-type *PINK1* cDNA rescued the mitochondrial defects. Empty vector served as a negative control. Two pathogenic variants and one benign variant were validated by independent assays."

Here's the JSON output based on this assumed excerpt:

**Important Notes:**

*   **MONDO Term:** I'm using MONDO:0003821 (Parkinson's Disease) as an example. You're expected to replace this with the correct MONDO ID if you are provided with a different literature.
*   **N.D. (Not Determined):** I'm using "N.D." for any details not explicitly stated in the assumed literature.
*   **Thresholds:**  I've defined the normal and abnormal readout thresholds based on the limited excerpt. You will refine this with more specific data.
*   **Workflow Integration:**  The actual HGVS standardization would be done by an API call in a production workflow, integrating into the JSON generation.
*   **Real Literature:** Provide the literature when you are ready to have the actual result to be generated.
