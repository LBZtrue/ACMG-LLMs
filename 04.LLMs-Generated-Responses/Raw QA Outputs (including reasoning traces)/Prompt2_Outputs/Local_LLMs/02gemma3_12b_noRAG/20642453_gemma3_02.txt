Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. Since no text was provided, I'll provide a template JSON response based on the instructions and examples you provided. I'm ready to process the actual text when you provide it.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Replace "Unknown"**:  I'm populating all fields with "Unknown" because I lack the source text.  You *must* replace these with the extracted values from the actual scientific paper or text.
*   **HGVS Nomenclature**: The standard format is NM/NP\_[Gene Name]\_[Isoform] : c.[Position] [Reference Base]>[Replacement Base].  Ensure this is accurate.
*   **MONDO ID**: If you can't find a MONDO ID, leave it as "Unknown."
*   **Thoroughness**: Fill in all details from the source material as completely as possible.
*   **Validation:** Carefully review the completed JSON for accuracy.  A small error can significantly alter the meaning.

Please provide the text now so I can populate this template with meaningful data.
