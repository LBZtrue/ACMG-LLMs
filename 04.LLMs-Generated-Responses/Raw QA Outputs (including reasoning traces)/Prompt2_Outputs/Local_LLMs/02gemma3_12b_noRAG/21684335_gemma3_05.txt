Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Please provide the text of the scientific article you want me to analyze. Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Extract all variant information (gene, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA/protein changes).
2.  Standardize the HGVS nomenclature.
3.  Identify the disease and find the corresponding MONDO ID.
4.  Parse experimental methods, details, and control groups.
5.  Generate a JSON output following the format outlined in your prompt.

I'm looking forward to receiving the text.
