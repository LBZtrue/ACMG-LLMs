Okay, I'm ready to process the literature you provide. Please provide the text of the scientific paper. I will then follow the outlined workflow and structure the extracted information into the JSON format as described. I will be using a hypothetical context until you provide the input.

Here's an example response, assuming the following (hypothetical) excerpt from a scientific paper:

"We investigated the role of mutations in the *SNCA* gene in familial Parkinson's disease.  A common variant, c.209A>G (p.E70G), was found to alter alpha-synuclein aggregation.  Experiments were conducted using primary fibroblasts from patients with the variant. Quantitative Western blot analysis was performed with three biological replicates per condition. A control lysate, lacking the *SNCA* mutation, showed baseline levels.  The mutant samples showed increased phosphorylation at Serine 129. Statistical significance was determined by a Student's t-test (p < 0.05).  A similar experiment using a known pathogenic SNCA variant, c.825A>T(p.K275M), demonstrated complete loss of function.  The c.209A>G variant showed a partial loss of function compared to wild type."
