Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature and generate the JSON output according to your specifications.  I will need the *actual text of the literature* to do this.  I cannot synthesize information or make assumptions; I require the content of the scientific paper.

**Once you provide the literature text, I will perform the following steps:**

1.  **Read and Parse the Text:** I'll carefully read the text to identify the relevant information.
2.  **Variant Extraction & HGVS Standardization:**  I will extract gene names, variant descriptions (cDNA changes and protein changes), and attempt to standardize the HGVS nomenclature using established conventions (and external resources if necessary).
3.  **Disease Identification:** I'm will identify the disease that is the focus of the functional experiments, and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from a MONDO database query.
4.  **Experimental Detail Extraction:** I'll extract details regarding assay methods, materials, readouts, controls, replicates, statistical analysis, and thresholds. I will carefully note what is described in the provided text.
5.  **JSON Construction:** Finally, I'll organize all the extracted information into the JSON structure you've provided.  Where information is missing or ambiguous, I will indicate that with "N.D." (Not Described).  Where a value is not provided in the source document, I will provide a reasonable estimate based on common practices or standard references when appropriate.
6.  **Present Result:** I will give you the generated JSON output.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Precision:** The quality of the JSON output will directly depend on the clarity and completeness of the literature text.
*   **Ambiguity:** Scientific papers can be ambiguous. I will try to interpret the text reasonably, but some judgment may be required. I will flag any ambiguous points and use the default `N.D.` as a placeholder.
*   **HGVS Standardization:** While I will use common practices, there can be variations in HGVS nomenclature. If a variant is presented in a non-standard way, I'm will do my best to correct it.
*   **Database Queries:**  For MONDO terms, I will require internet connectivity to query the MONDO database.

**Please provide the text of the scientific paper so I can begin.**
