Okay, I'd be happy to process the provided text and generate the JSON output according to your specifications. Since you haven't provided the actual literature to analyze, I'm going to create a representative JSON output based on the information provided in the prompt and the examples. **Please replace the generated content with the actual information extracted from your literature.**

Here's a sample JSON output based on the given context:

```json

**Important Notes:**

*   **Replace Placeholder Data:**  You *must* replace all the placeholder data in this JSON with the actual data you extract from the provided literature.  This includes the HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, descriptions, and all other fields.
*   **MONDO Database Retrieval:**  The MONDO term is just an example. You’d need to consult the MONDO database to find the correct term for the disease being studied in the literature.
*   **Accurate Molecular Effect:** The "Molecular Effect" section should be populated with descriptions directly from the literature.
*   **Validation Controls:** If the study does not include validation controls, set "Counts" to 0 and ensure the presence of the controls is described accurately.

To help me generate a more accurate JSON output, please provide the actual text from the literature.  I’m ready to provide a more refined response when you do.
