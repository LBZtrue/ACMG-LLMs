Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. I need the text of the scientific literature you want me to analyze. Please provide the text of the paper. Once you provide the text, I will perform the following steps:

1.  **Extract Variants:** Identify all mentioned variants, extracting gene names, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS Nomenclature:** Use a reliable HGVS nomenclature standardization tool (if available, I'll simulate this based on generally accepted rules if a direct API call isn't possible).
3.  **Identify Disease & Retrieve MONDO Term:** Determine the disease investigated in the paper and retrieve its corresponding MONDO term. I will use a MONDO database lookup (simulated if no direct API access).
4.  **Extract Experimental Methods:** Identify all experimental methods used, and extract details of materials, readouts, replicates, controls, statistical analysis, thresholds, and assay approval.
5.  **Organize Data:** Construct a JSON output adhering to the specified schema.
6.  **Generate Response:** Deliver the JSON output representing the extracted and organized data.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **API Access:** If you can provide access to HGVS nomenclature standardization tools or MONDO databases via API, I can achieve a higher degree of accuracy. If not, I'll use logic to simulate this process.
*   **Text Length:** The longer the text, the more computationally intensive the process will be.
*   **Complexity:** Highly complex texts with numerous variants or nuanced experimental details might require iterative processing.
*   **Assumptions:** If information is missing, I'm going to try and provide a reasonable value that adheres to the instructions.

**Please provide the text of the scientific literature now.**
