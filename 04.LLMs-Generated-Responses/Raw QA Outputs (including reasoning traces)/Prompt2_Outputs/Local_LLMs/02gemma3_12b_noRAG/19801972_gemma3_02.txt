Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate the JSON output according to your detailed instructions. Please provide the text you want me to analyze. I'm prepared to:

1.  **Extract variant information:** Identify genes, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS nomenclature:** Use a variant nomenclature API (if you can provide a link/information about the API, I'm ready to use it).  Without that, I'm working with the provided text only.
3.  **Identify the disease and MONDO term:** Extract the disease name and attempt to find the corresponding MONDO term (I’m ready to use a MONDO API or search online if a link/specific instructions are given; otherwise, I'll attempt based on text).
4.  **Extract Experiment details:** Parse experimental procedures, materials, readouts, controls, replicates, statistics, and thresholds.
5.  **Format the data:** Assemble the extracted information into the specified JSON structure.

**Waiting for the input text...**
