Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. However, you haven't *provided* the literature itself. I need the text of the scientific paper or excerpt to be able to extract the information and format it into the JSON structure you're requesting.

**Please provide the text of the scientific literature you want me to analyze.**

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  **Extract** all relevant information.
2.  **Standardize** HGVS nomenclature (I'm assuming you're providing a URL for a nomenclature standard - please provide this if you want me to actually perform this standardization).
3.  **Determine** the disease and find its MONDO term (I'm assuming access to a MONDO database, and that a search term or method is provided).
4.  **Interpret** the experimental design and results.
5.  **Format** the information into the JSON structure.

**Example - demonstrating what I'm expecting once you provide the text**

Let's assume you provided a very simple, hypothetical excerpt that contained the following:

"A novel variant in the *MAPT* gene, c.1234A>G (p.Lys412Arg), was identified in a patient with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).  Western blot analysis showed reduced levels of MAPT protein in fibroblasts from the affected individual compared to controls. Three independent experiments were performed. A wild-type plasmid was used as a positive control, and an empty vector as a negative control.  Results were analyzed using a t-test, with a p-value <0.05 considered statistically significant. Normal levels of protein expression were defined as >80% of the control. This variant’s presence was confirmed using Sanger sequencing."

Here’s how I would represent this with the JSON format:
