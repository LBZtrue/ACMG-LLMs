Okay, I'll process the provided literature content and generate the JSON output based on your instructions.

**Please provide the literature content you want me to analyze.**

I need the text of the scientific article/abstract/paragraph you want me to work with. Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Identify genes, variants, and their descriptions.
2.  Standardize the HGVS nomenclature (I'm relying on publicly available resources for this, as I can't actively call an API).
3.  Determine the disease being studied.
4.  Identify any experimental methods and details (replicates, controls, statistics, etc.).
5.  Construct the JSON output in the format you're requesting.

**I'm ready when you provide the text!**
