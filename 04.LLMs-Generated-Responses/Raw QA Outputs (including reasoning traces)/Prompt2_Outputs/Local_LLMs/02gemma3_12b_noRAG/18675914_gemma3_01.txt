Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate the JSON output according to your instructions. Please provide the text of the literature you want me to analyze. I'll do my best to extract the information and format it accurately within the JSON structure. I'm anticipating a document describing experiments involving variants and their effects on cellular processes, likely relating to Hereditary Myopathy or a similar condition. Once you provide the text, I will perform the following steps:

1.  **Text Analysis:** Read and understand the provided text.
2.  **Variant Extraction:** Identify gene names, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
3.  **HGVS Standardization:**  I will use a simulated HGVS standardization process. Since I don't have access to a live HGVS API, I will attempt to accurately transform preliminary nomenclature into standardized form based on common conventions.
4.  **Disease Identification:** Determine the disease being studied.
5.  **MONDO Retrieval:**  Since I cannot directly query a database, I'd need you to *provide* the MONDO term if it’s available. If not, I will indicate "N/A" in the JSON.
6.  **Experiment Detail Extraction:** Pull all relevant details about experimental methods, materials, results, controls, statistical analysis, thresholds, and assay validation.
7.  **JSON Formatting:**  Organize the extracted data into the specified JSON structure.

**I'm waiting for the literature text!**
