Okay, let's process the provided text and generate the JSON output. Based on the provided text, we're expected to extract information from the literature, perform HGVS nomenclature standardization (which I can't do without an API call, so I'm representing the standardized forms as they appear), identify the disease, and construct the JSON structure.

Here's the JSON output based solely on the provided text. **Please note that a real-world implementation would require API calls for HGVS standardization and MONDO lookups.**

**Important Considerations & Future Improvements:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:** A real application would need to utilize an API (e.g., NCBI's variant API, Ensembl's API) to accurately standardize HGVS nomenclature.
*   **MONDO Lookup:**  The MONDO ID would ideally be retrieved dynamically via an API call to the MONDO database.
*   **Contextual Data:** The provided text is extremely limited. A full extraction would need to process the entire text of the paper to populate all fields accurately.
*   **Error Handling:** The code should handle cases where information is missing or unavailable.
*   **More Detailed Descriptions:** Some sections, like "Material Used," might benefit from more detailed descriptions based on the full text.

This is a structural representation based on the provided instructions. A functioning solution would require integration with external APIs and more detailed processing of the original document.
