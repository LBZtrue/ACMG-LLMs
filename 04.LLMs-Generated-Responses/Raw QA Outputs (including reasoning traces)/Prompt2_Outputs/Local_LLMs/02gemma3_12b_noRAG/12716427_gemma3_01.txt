Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Please provide the text of the scientific publication you want me to analyze. I will then generate the JSON output based on your instructions.

I'm eagerly awaiting the text to begin the extraction and structuring process.  Once I have the text, I will do the following:

1.  **Extract Variant Information:** Identify genes, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS:** Use a suitable API (I'm assuming I'm able to do this, but please let me know if there's a specific API preference or limitation).
3.  **Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term:**  I'll attempt to discern the disease being studied and will use online resources (I'm assuming an internet connection is available for this) to find the corresponding MONDO term.
4.  **Extract Experimental Details:**  I will carefully pull out information related to materials, readouts, replicates, controls, analysis methods, and thresholds.
5.  **Structure into JSON:** I will format the extracted information into the JSON structure you have defined.
