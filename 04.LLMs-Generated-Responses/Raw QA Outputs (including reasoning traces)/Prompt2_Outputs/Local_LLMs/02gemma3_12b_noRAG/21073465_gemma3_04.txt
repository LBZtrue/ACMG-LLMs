**Explanation of Choices & Assumptions:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:** As requested, the HGVS nomenclature has been extracted and kept in the specified format.
*   **MONDO Term:** I've included the MONDO term as requested.
*   **Descriptions:** I've tried to preserve the original descriptions from the text while structuring them appropriately.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   I assumed that the information provided was a complete representation of the experimental data.  If additional information exists, the JSON could be expanded.
    *   I've made best guess at appropriate conclusions and molecular effects based on the descriptions, but in real situations, these would require more in-depth knowledge.
*   **Fill in the Details** In a real-world scenario, the threshold for normal/abnormal readout may need to be generated as a custom value, especially if not present in the primary source.

This structured JSON output is ready for use and can be adapted to include more details as needed.
