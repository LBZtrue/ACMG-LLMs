Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature and generate the JSON output.  **Please provide the text of the literature.** I need the text of the research paper or article to extract the information and fulfill the requirements of your workflow.

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  **Identify Genes and Variants:**  I'll extract information about the genes involved and the specific variants mentioned, noting preliminary HGVS nomenclature and the corresponding cDNA/protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS:** I will attempt to standardize the HGVS nomenclature (using a theoretical API call – I'm not actually connected to one in this environment, but will demonstrate the expected format).
3.  **Disease Identification & MONDO Retrieval:**  I'll identify the disease being studied and look up the associated MONDO term (again, simulating an API call).
4.  **Experimental Detail Extraction:** I’ll meticulously extract all experimental details—materials, readouts, replicates, controls, statistical methods, thresholds, and assessment of "approved assay" status—from the provided text.
5.  **Compose JSON:** Finally, I will assemble all of the extracted and standardized data into the pre-defined JSON format.

**I am waiting for you to provide the literature text.**
