Okay, here's the JSON output based on the provided text. Because you only provided the abstract of a query, I'm generating a hypothetical answer based on that context. Let's assume the literature presents data from the provided papers.  I will structure the output in the defined JSON format.  Because the actual scientific data isn't included, some fields will be marked with "N/A" or estimates where appropriate.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Data Dependency:**  This output is *entirely dependent* on the hypothetical data presented in the literature. The values, molecular effects, and conclusions are placeholders. Actual values would come from the experimental results.
*   **Estimation:** Several fields (especially thresholds and validation controls) are estimated because you haven't provided the details of the experimental procedures or actual readout data.
*   **MONDO term:** You will need to verify and confirm the correct MONDO term number. I've put an example, but it needs to be validated.
* **HGVS Nomenclature:** I'm assuming your literature provided enough context that these could be generated.
