Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Please provide the text of the scientific paper you want me to analyze. Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Extract the necessary information.
2.  Standardize HGVS nomenclature (I'm assuming a publicly available tool or API is not provided, so I'm reliant on correct naming conventions based on the provided information).
3.  Look up corresponding MONDO terms.
4.  Format the extracted data into the requested JSON structure.

I will do my best to fulfill your request accurately, but the quality of the output will depend directly on the clarity and completeness of the information in the provided text. I'll also make assumptions where necessary and clearly document them.
