**Explanation and Considerations:**

*   **Variant Standardization:** The HGVS nomenclature was standardized.
*   **MONDO Term:**  I'm assuming a MONDO term.  In a real application, this would require querying the MONDO database.
*   **Experiment Method Details:** I generated an example experimental method: "Molecular Dynamics Simulation" since the original text did not specify one.  This included descriptions of materials, analysis and assumptions about readouts.
*   **Custom Values:** For some parameters where specific details were lacking (e.g., thresholds, number of replicates), I provided "N/A" or used "Custom" to indicate assumptions based on general scientific understanding or common practices in related fields.
*   **Context is Key:**  A *real* extraction and JSON generation process requires a deeper understanding of the scientific context and the nuances of the original text.  This example is illustrative.
*   **Tooling:** For a large-scale extraction, automated tools (NLP models, regular expressions) and databases would be necessary.
