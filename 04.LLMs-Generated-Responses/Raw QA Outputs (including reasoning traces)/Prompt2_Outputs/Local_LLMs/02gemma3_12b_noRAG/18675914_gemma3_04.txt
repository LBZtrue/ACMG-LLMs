Okay, I'd need the text of the provided literature to complete this task. I am designed to analyze text. I can't work without the text to extract the information.

However, I can provide a comprehensive, well-formatted JSON output based on the *provided text snippet* for a hypothetical scenario, mirroring the structure and level of detail you've requested.  This serves as a template I will populate when you provide the relevant text.

**Hypothetical Scenario: Examining LRRK2 mutations and related experiments**

Let's imagine the provided text describes experiments investigating the impact of a specific mutation (G2019S) within the LRRK2 gene, and its influence on phosphorylation of downstream targets.

**Important notes and what I need from you:**

*   **Provide the text:** To fully populate this JSON, I *need* the actual text from the paper or document you're working with.
*   **MONDO IDs:** Retrieving precise MONDO IDs requires more extensive lookups and might necessitate some external tools. If you have those, please provide them.
*   **Specifics:** The more detail you give me about the experiments, the more accurate and complete the JSON will be. For example, specific antibody names, exact phosphorylation sites, and experimental conditions are all valuable.
*   **Review:**  I’m here to automate, but always review the output for accuracy. I may misinterpret something or miss a detail.

Once you provide the text, I'll generate a JSON tailored to the specific information it contains.
