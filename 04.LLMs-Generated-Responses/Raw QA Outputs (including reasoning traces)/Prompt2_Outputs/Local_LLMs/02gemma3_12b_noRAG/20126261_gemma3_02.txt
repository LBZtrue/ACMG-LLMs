Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Please provide the text of the scientific paper. I will then:

1.  Extract the relevant information as described in the instructions.
2.  Standardize HGVS nomenclature (I will use a hypothetical API for this purpose – see note below).
3.  Identify the disease and retrieve the MONDO term.
4.  Populate the JSON structure.

**Important Notes:**

*   **HGVS API:** I will assume a basic HGVS API call is possible for standardization. I will format the standardized nomenclature in the JSON as `NM_XXXXXXX:c.XXXXX>Y`.  Since I don't have a live API, I will assume the conversion is correct for demonstration purposes.
*   **MONDO Retrieval:** I will simulate the MONDO lookup. In a real workflow, this would involve querying the MONDO database.
*   **Thresholds:**  For "Source" of thresholds, I'll mark it as either "Literature" if directly mentioned, or "Custom" if I'm inferring a standard based on general biological knowledge.
*   **Specificity:** The level of detail I can extract depends entirely on the information available in the paper.

**Please provide the text of the paper so I can begin.**
