Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since you haven't provided any specific literature, I'll use the example you gave (regarding TP53, Hereditary Myopathy, and Western Blot) and expand upon it to demonstrate the complete workflow and JSON structure.  I will *assume* more information and choices to populate all fields.  **Please provide the actual literature you want me to process so I can give you a completely accurate and tailored JSON response.**

**Important Notes:**

*   **This is an example.**  The specific values (molecular effects, thresholds, statistical methods, etc.) are illustrative. I’m assuming here that you're studying hereditary myopathy, and that your variants affect protein expression and/or function.
*   **Accuracy Requires Literature:** I need the text of the literature you want me to analyze to produce an accurate response.  Without it, I'm guessing.
*   **MONDO IDs:** I have added a MONDO ID to the HMCC example, but it's essential to confirm the correct ID for your specific context.
*   **Expandable:** I'm capable of incorporating many other details and methods from your actual research.
