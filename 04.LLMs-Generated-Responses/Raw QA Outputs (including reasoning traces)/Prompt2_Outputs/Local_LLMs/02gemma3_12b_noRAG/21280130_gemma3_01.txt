Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. Since you're instructing me to extract information *from the provided text*, and haven't provided any text, I'm going to *create* some sample text to work with. This will allow me to demonstrate how I would extract and format the information according to your strict instructions.

**Sample Text (Simulated Literature Excerpt):**

"We investigated the role of a novel missense variant in the *TTN* gene (NM_001125950.1:c.8457G>A) in patients exhibiting late-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. This variant, predicted to cause a glycine to aspartic acid substitution (p.G2817D) within the titin rod domain, was identified in three unrelated individuals.  Western blot analysis using patient-derived fibroblasts showed significantly reduced titin expression compared to control fibroblasts (p < 0.01).  To confirm these findings, we also analyzed the variant in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.  These cells exhibited compromised sarcomere structure as evidenced by immunostaining. Control experiments using wild-type *TTN* cDNA in fibroblasts showed normal protein levels. We performed three biological replicates for the Western blot experiment and two technical replicates for each sample. A commercially available anti-titin antibody was used for Western blotting.  A loss-of-function molecular effect is predicted. Two pathogenic variants and one benign variant were validated with this methodology."

**Explanation of Decisions:**

*   **MONDO Term:** I’m assuming a possible MONDO term from related diseases.  A real-world implementation would require more context or a direct reference.
*   **Basic Negative Control:** This was not explicitly stated in the sample text so, "N.D." was assigned.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** I extracted the reported "p < 0.01" from the text.
*   **Thresholds:** These were based on the descriptions in the provided text.
*   **Approved Assay:** I assumed this was an approved method based on its use in the context of evaluating a genetic disorder.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Accuracy:** The output depends *entirely* on the accuracy of the input text.
*   **Context:** Providing more text would lead to a more complete analysis and potentially more accurate MONDO term selection.
*   **API Integration:** A real-world solution would involve API calls to retrieve accurate HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms.
*   **Assumptions:** Several assumptions have been made (e.g., about the approval status of the assay).
*   **Customization:** This JSON structure can be adapted to match specific reporting requirements.
