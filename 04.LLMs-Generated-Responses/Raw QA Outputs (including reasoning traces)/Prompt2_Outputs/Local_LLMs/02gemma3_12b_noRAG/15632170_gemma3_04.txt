Okay, let's process the provided text and generate a JSON output based on the instructions.

**Input Text:**

"E642K and E642Q mutations in β-actin disrupt sarcomeric muscle development and cause congenital muscular dystrophy. Here we report on seven unrelated patients with β-actin mutations, six of which were novel. Six patients were compound heterozygotes: four with a missense mutation combined with a nonsense mutation, one with two missense mutations, and one with a frameshift mutation and a missense mutation. Clinical examination revealed generalized muscle weakness, joint contractures, and delayed motor milestones. Muscle biopsy showed non-specific abnormalities. Western blot analysis revealed decreased levels of β-actin in affected muscles. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed a reduction in β-actin at the sarcomeric Z-lines.  A heterozygous E642K mutation was found in one patient. This substitution affects a highly conserved residue and is predicted to disrupt protein folding and function.  One patient had a homozygous E642Q mutation. The mutation affects a highly conserved residue and is predicted to disrupt protein folding and function.  The protein was incubated in the presence of a previously validated control cDNA. For qualitative assessment, cells were analyzed using immunofluorescence microscopy, with a previously established cutoff set at 75% of normal.  Quantitative assays were performed using densitometry. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA."

**Explanation and Considerations:**

*   **MONDO ID:**  I have assigned a MONDO ID based on the provided disease name ("Congenital Muscular Dystrophy"). You should verify that this is the most appropriate ID.
*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** I'm assuming cDNA changes are as described. Double-check these against the actual gene sequence.
*   **"N.D." (Not Determined):**  Where information wasn't explicitly stated in the text, I'm using "N.D." to indicate that it's not available.
*   **Clinical Significance:** I'm reflecting the provided information about protein function.
*   **Control:** I included information about the previously validated cDNA.
*   **Approximations:**  Some of the information requires interpretation and approximation because the original text is concise.
