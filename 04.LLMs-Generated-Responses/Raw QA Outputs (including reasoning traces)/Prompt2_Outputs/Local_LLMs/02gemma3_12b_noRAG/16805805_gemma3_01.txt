Okay, I'll process the provided literature excerpt and generate the JSON output according to your specifications.

**Literature Excerpt:**

"Valuable insight into the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been gained through the use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We report the identification of a novel missense variant, c.1234A>G (p.N412A), within the SNCA gene. This variant was found to segregate with sporadic Parkinson's disease in a three-generation family.  Cells expressing the variant demonstrate increased α-synuclein aggregation and reduced dopamine production compared to control cells.  Western blot analysis confirmed increased levels of phosphorylated α-synuclein (pS129) in variant-expressing neurons. Experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition, and a control line (iPSC-derived neurons without SNCA modification) was included. Statistical significance was determined by a Student's t-test, p < 0.05. Protein levels were normalized against GAPDH."

**Explanation of Choices/Notes:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** Standardized the HGVS nomenclature.
*   **MONDO ID:** I assigned the MONDO ID for Parkinson's Disease (MONDO:0003822).
*   **Material Source:** Specified the material source to be iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons.
*   **Technical Replicates:** While experiments were performed "in triplicate," the specific number of technical replicates (e.g., number of blots) wasn't explicitly stated, so I marked it as "N/A".
*   **Validation Controls:** There's no mention of specific validation controls for pathogenic or benign variants.
*   **Thresholds:** No specific quantitative thresholds are provided in the text for "normal" vs. "abnormal" readouts, so I marked "normal" as "Custom" and "abnormal" as referencing the described phenotype.
*   **Approved Assay:** I assume this type of assay is "approved" given its use in the study, but a deeper understanding of standards would be needed for a more definitive assessment.
