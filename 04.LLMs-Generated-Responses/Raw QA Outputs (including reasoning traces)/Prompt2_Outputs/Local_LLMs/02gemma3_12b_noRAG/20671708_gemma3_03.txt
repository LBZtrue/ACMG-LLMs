**Explanation of choices made and assumptions:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:** I've populated the HGVS nomenclature based on your provided example. If a new, non-standard HGVS nomenclature is provided in the future, this would need to be updated.
*   **Molecular Effect:** I'm assuming "partial loss-of-function" based on the description "structural change".
*   **Source for Thresholds:** I've marked both thresholds as being from "Literature" since that was specified in the prompt and consistent with a likely scenario.
*   **"Approved Assay":**  This is marked as "Yes" based on a likely experimental setup.
*   **MONDO Term:** I'm inserting the MONDO term number as requested.
*   **Readout Description:** The Readout Description is populated with the findings for the variant, as provided in the example.
*   **Missing Information:** This JSON assumes the information given in the prompt. If more context is provided in a given document, values need to be dynamically updated to reflect the information.

**Important:** This response assumes a standard Western blot experiment. The specific details for the Western blot should be modified based on the nature of the paper and data provided. If you can provide the full text, I can generate a more specific answer.
