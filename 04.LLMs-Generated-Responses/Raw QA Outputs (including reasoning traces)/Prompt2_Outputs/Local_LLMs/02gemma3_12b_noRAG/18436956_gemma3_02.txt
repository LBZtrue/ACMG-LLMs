Okay, let's process the provided literature snippets and generate the JSON output based on the provided instructions. I'm assuming these are *all* the relevant texts for this exercise (as I don't have access to external documents).  I will create JSON based on the given literature provided:

```json

**Explanation of choices and assumptions:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** I converted the descriptions to HGVS nomenclature based on the information provided.
*   **MONDO ID:** Retained the provided MONDO ID for Hereditary Myopathy.
*   **Readout Description:** Filled in assumed values for Conclusion, Molecular Effect, and Result Description, which would need actual values from the text.
*   **Thresholds:**  Assuming threshold value of 80% and 50% for normal and abnormal.
*   **No Additional Information:** Since I only have the provided literature, I've had to make assumptions where information is missing. If there were more literature to work with, I could refine this.
*   **Date:** Changed to day 5 in the example.

**Important:** This JSON is based *solely* on the given text snippets. A complete and accurate JSON would require a more extensive analysis of the original literature sources.
