Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since no literature was provided, I will use the example provided in the prompt to construct the JSON output.

**Explanation of choices and assumptions:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:**  I've followed the provided preliminary HGVS nomenclature and presented it in the correct format.
*   **MONDO Retrieval:**  I've included the example MONDO term.  In a real-world application, a lookup to the MONDO database would be performed.
*   **Readout Description:** The 'Readout description' array includes specific details about the experiment results for the mentioned variant.
*   **Source for thresholds**: The provided text indicated that thresholds were extracted from the "Literature", hence I am setting the source this way.
*   **Molecular effect**:  I used "partial loss-of-function" based on the example.

**To provide a more accurate response, please provide the text of the literature you would like me to analyze.** I will then update this JSON output with the information extracted from the provided text.
