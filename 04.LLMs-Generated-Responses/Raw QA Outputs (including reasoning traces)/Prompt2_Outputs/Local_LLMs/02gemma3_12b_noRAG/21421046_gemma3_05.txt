Okay, let's process the provided literature and generate the JSON output according to the detailed instructions.

**Literature Snippet (For Processing):**

"Several studies have implicated mutations in the *PINK1* gene in familial Parkinson's disease. We investigated the functional consequences of the *PINK1* variant c.1133G>A (p.R378Q). This variant was found to be homozygous in a patient with early-onset Parkinson's.  Patient-derived fibroblasts were used to assess mitochondrial membrane potential using tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) fluorescence.  Control cells (HEK293) and patient fibroblasts were compared.  Three biological replicates were performed.  A positive control, consisting of cells expressing wild-type *PINK1*, was also included.  No statistical analysis was explicitly mentioned. Protein levels of mitochondrial proteins were decreased in the patient fibroblasts compared to the controls. A reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed. The average TMRM fluorescence in the patient fibroblasts was 20% lower compared to the controls.  No further validation controls were added."

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:** The initial HGVS nomenclature was standardized to include the transcript ID.
*   **MONDO Term:**  I've assigned "MONDO:0005056" for Familial Parkinson's disease.
*   **N.D. (Not Determined):**  I'm using "N.D." where information is explicitly missing from the text or cannot be reasonably inferred. This signifies that the value is not available, not ignored.
*   **Molecular Effect:** Based on the information provided, I'm interpreting the variant as having a partial loss-of-function effect due to its association with disease onset.
*   **Thresholds:**  Without explicit thresholds provided, I’m setting “N.D” for both normal and abnormal readouts.
*   **Approved Assay:** Unable to determine from provided text.
