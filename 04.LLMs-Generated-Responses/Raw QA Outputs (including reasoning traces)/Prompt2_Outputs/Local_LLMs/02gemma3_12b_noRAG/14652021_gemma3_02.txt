Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. Since you're providing an example workflow and not the actual text from the literature, I will simulate the process based on the text provided in the prompt. I'm going to assume the provided literature mentions the following:

*   **Variant:** TP53 c.248G>A (p.G83D) is discussed, impacting protein structure and function.
*   **Disease:** Hereditary Myopathy is the disease being investigated.
*   **Experiment:** Western Blot experiment using HEK293 cells.
*   **Results:** Variant protein expression is reduced by 50%.
*   **Controls**: Wild-type cDNA and empty vector were used as positive and negative controls respectively.
*   **Replicates**: Biological and technical replicates were included.

Here's the JSON output based on this simulated literature analysis. I will use a placeholder for the HGVS nomenclature standardization from API, as the actual API integration is beyond the scope of this exercise.

**Important Notes:**

*   **API Integration:** The HGVS nomenclature standardization needs to be implemented with a suitable API call.  A placeholder is included for that.
*   **Assumptions:** I've had to make assumptions where the original document didn't explicitly state something (e.g., thresholds for normal/abnormal).  In a real scenario, these would need to be either confirmed from the document or determined using domain expertise.
*   **Validation Controls:** I assumed there were no validation controls. If they existed the fields would be filled in.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** There was no mention of a specific statistical method.
*   **Real Literature:** This output is based on a *simulated* literature text. Providing the real text will lead to a more accurate and relevant JSON output.
*   **Context**: Without the original text, some fields are vague or have defaults set, to showcase a complete model.

I am ready for the next step. Please provide the text from the literature you want me to process.
