Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate the JSON output.  Since I don't have the *actual text* of the literature to work with, I'm going to use the example provided within the prompt to create a realistic example response. I'm assuming the text describes experiments on the given mutations, a cell line, Western blotting, and includes information about controls and thresholds.  **Please provide the full text of the literature so I can produce a more accurate and comprehensive JSON output.**

Here's the JSON output based on the provided example:

```json

        "Approved assay": "Yes"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important Notes:**

*   **This is an example.** The specific details within the JSON (like molecular effect, thresholds, number of controls) are based on the example text. They *will* change with the real text.
*   **MONDO ID:**  I'm using the MONDO ID provided.  If the text describes a different disease or lacks an explicit MONDO ID, I'd need to find the correct ID.
*   **API for HGVS Nomenclature:** I'm not actually performing an API call to standardize the HGVS nomenclature in this response.  To do that, I would need to integrate a specific API and provide the necessary credentials.
*   **Custom Thresholds:** In some cases, the literature won't provide explicit thresholds. I'm indicating the 'Source' as "Literature" for the ones I'm copying directly. If I need to create a custom threshold based on my own knowledge, I would mark the 'Source' as "Custom."

**To get a more accurate and complete JSON output, please provide the full text of the literature.**  I am ready to process the actual text and generate a more tailored response.
