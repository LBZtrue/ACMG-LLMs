Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. However, you haven't provided the literature text to be analyzed. I need the content of the research paper or abstract to extract the requested information and create the JSON output.

**Please provide the text you want me to analyze.**

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Identify variants and their descriptions.
2.  Standardize HGVS nomenclature (I'm assuming I'll have access to a standard reference for this).
3.  Determine the disease name and retrieve its MONDO ID.
4.  Extract details about experimental methods, materials, readouts, controls, replicates, and statistical analyses.
5.  Construct the JSON output according to the specified format.

I look forward to receiving the text and completing your request!
