Okay, let's apply this workflow to the provided literature excerpt:

**Literature Excerpt:**

"Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutations are frequently encountered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Here, we investigated the functional impact of the SOD1 G93A variant. This variant leads to a slight decrease in SOD1 activity in vitro.  Experiments were performed using cultured motor neurons derived from iPSC lines. SOD1 protein levels were quantified by Western blot, with three biological replicates per condition. A loading control (β-actin) was included to normalize protein levels.  Results showed that SOD1 G93A exhibited a 20% reduction in protein levels compared to wild-type SOD1. No specific statistical analysis was reported."

Now, let's generate the JSON output. Note that the HGVS nomenclature standardization requires an API call, which I cannot do here. I will assume the nomenclature is already standardized for demonstration purposes.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **MONDO ID:**  I assigned MONDO:0003709 (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) based on the literature's mention of ALS.
*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** I included the provided nomenclature.
*   **Readout Description:** The description includes the 20% reduction mentioned.
*   **N.D. (Not Determined):** I used N.D. where information was not available in the excerpt.  For instance, the number of technical replicates and statistical analysis methods were not specified.
*   **Thresholds:** No specific threshold for normal/abnormal protein levels was given.  I'm using the 20% reduction as the abnormal result.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:**  A proper HGVS API call would ensure the accuracy and consistency of the nomenclature.
*   **Thresholds:** If more context or additional data were available, more refined thresholds for normal/abnormal results could be determined.
*   **Customization:** This is an interpretation based on the limited information provided. A domain expert may have different insights or specific criteria.
