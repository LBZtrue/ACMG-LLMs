Okay, I'd be happy to process the provided list of references and generate the JSON output according to your specifications.  Since you haven't provided any references, I will generate a JSON example based on a hypothetical scenario inspired by the documents you provided.

Let's assume the following hypothetical scenario: The literature describes experiments investigating mutations in the *SNCA* gene, linked to Parkinson's Disease, using fly models and cell culture assays.

Here's the JSON output.  *Please note:*  This is illustrative and requires the provided literature references to populate correctly.  Also, standardized HGVS nomenclature requires an API call that I cannot perform within this text-based environment, so the examples here show placeholder values.  I will include descriptions of where external API calls would be used.

**Key Notes & API Integration:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** A proper implementation would require integration with a tool like ANNOVAR or Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) to accurately convert cDNA and protein changes into the standard HGVS nomenclature. The provided values are placeholders.
*   **MONDO ID Retrieval:** The MONDO ID could be looked up programmatically using a MONDO API.
*   **Description Extraction:** The descriptions of materials, controls, and analyses would be best pulled directly from the literature using text processing techniques (e.g., NLP, regular expressions) for greater accuracy.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** The thresholds for normal/abnormal readouts are difficult to determine without more context. The custom option should be reserved for cases where this is not defined in the literature.
