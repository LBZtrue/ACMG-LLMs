Okay, let's apply this workflow to the provided literature snippet. Since no actual literature is provided, I'm going to *assume* a small, representative excerpt containing relevant information for demonstration.  I will fabricate some details to make the example complete.

**Assumed Literature Snippet:**

"We investigated the role of mutations in the *LAMA2* gene in a cohort of patients with Hereditary Myopathy.  One patient carried the variant *LAMA2* c.1234A>G (p.H411R).  Quantitative RT-PCR showed a significant decrease in *LAMA2* mRNA levels (approximately 60% reduction) in fibroblasts derived from the affected individual compared to control fibroblasts.  Immunoblot analysis revealed a corresponding decrease in the LAMA2 protein level.  A wild-type *LAMA2* cDNA was used as a positive control in RT-PCR and immunoblotting.  Two additional patients with confirmed *LAMA2* mutations were tested and showed similar reductions in mRNA and protein levels. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student’s t-test."

**Explanation and Key Considerations:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:**  I'm assuming the initial HGVS nomenclature needed correction.
*   **MONDO Term:** The example MONDO term is placeholder.
*   **N.D. (Not Determined):** When information wasn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text (e.g., technical replicates, negative controls), I've used "N.D."  Real-world data would require more detailed investigation.
*   **Custom Thresholds:**  I set "Custom" for normal readout thresholds because the text didn't provide specific quantitative values. A biologist would need to define these based on established norms.
* **Multiple Assays:** The example used both RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Each was included separately.

**To use this effectively, you need to:**

1.  **Replace the assumed snippet with your actual literature.**
2.  **Verify HGVS nomenclature using a reliable tool.**
3.  **Find the correct MONDO term.**
4.  **Complete any missing information from the literature or through other investigations.**
