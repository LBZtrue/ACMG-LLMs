Okay, here's the JSON output based on the provided literature excerpt.  Since no actual literature excerpt was given, I'm creating a plausible example, and populating the fields with plausible information. **Please replace this with your actual literature data.**

**Important Notes:**

*   **Replace Placeholder Data:**  This is a *template*.  Replace every part of the data with the actual details from your literature excerpt.
*   **MONDO IDs:** Verify the accuracy of the MONDO IDs. The provided ID is an example.
*   **"No" for Controls:**  If certain controls were *not* performed, state "No" as I did in some places.  It’s important to be accurate.
*   **Assay Details:** Populate all Assay Method details from the literature.
*   **Molecular Effect:**  This needs to be determined from the literature's interpretation of how the variant alters function.
* **Technical Replicates:**  Technical replicates are very important. Make sure to document if they were used.

To help me generate a more accurate JSON output, please provide the actual literature excerpt you need me to process.  I can then accurately fill in the details.
