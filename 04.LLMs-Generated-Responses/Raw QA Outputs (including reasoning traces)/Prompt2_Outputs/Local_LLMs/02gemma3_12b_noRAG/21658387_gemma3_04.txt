Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. However, **I need the actual text of the literature to perform the extraction and standardization**.  I cannot work with instructions alone.

Please provide the text of the literature, and I will generate the JSON output based on your detailed instructions. I will use the following steps:

1. **Read and Understand:** I will read and thoroughly understand the provided text.
2. **Variant Extraction:** I will identify all gene mentions, variants (preliminary HGVS nomenclature), cDNA changes, and protein changes.
3. **HGVS Standardization:** I will use a validated HGVS nomenclature converter (if necessary) to standardize the variant HGVS descriptions.
4. **Disease Identification:** I will extract the disease being studied and attempt to find its corresponding MONDO term through a search. If unable to find it I'll include N.D.
5. **Method Extraction:** I will identify the experimental methods used and extract the requested details, including materials, controls, replicates, statistical methods, and thresholds.
6. **Approved Assay Determination:** Based on the methods described, I will attempt to determine if the method is generally approved for the disease.
7. **JSON Generation:** I will compile all extracted information into the JSON format you provided.

**Waiting for the text of the literature to begin.**
