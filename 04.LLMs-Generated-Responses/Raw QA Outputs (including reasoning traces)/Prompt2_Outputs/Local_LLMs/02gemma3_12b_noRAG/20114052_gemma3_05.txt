Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since no literature was provided, I will use the information provided in the prompt's examples to create the JSON output as requested.  I will create a JSON response containing one variant, one disease, and one experimental method as the examples demonstrate.

```json

**Important Notes:**

*   **No Literature Input:** This JSON is generated *solely* from the example provided in the prompt. To work with actual literature, you *must* provide the text of the study.
*   **Variable Filling:**  The fields like "Molecular Effect," "Source" for the threshold values, etc. would need to be populated based on the content of the literature.  I'm using placeholders/defaults based on the example.
*   **HGVS Standardization:**  I've assumed a standard format for HGVS.  A proper HGVS standardization service should be used in a production setting. I have also assumed that the transcript ID is NM_001126112.3
*   **MONDO Retrieval:**  In a real application, you would need to integrate with the MONDO database to retrieve the appropriate term.
*   **Error Handling:** Production code should include robust error handling for cases where data is missing or the literature is ambiguous.
