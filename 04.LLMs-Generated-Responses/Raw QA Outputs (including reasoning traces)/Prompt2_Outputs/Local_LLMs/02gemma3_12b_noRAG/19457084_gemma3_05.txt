Okay, I'd be happy to process the provided literature and generate the JSON output as requested. However, you haven't provided any *actual* literature content. I need the text of the scientific publication to extract the necessary information.

**Please provide the text of the scientific article.**

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Read the text and extract relevant data.
2.  Standardize HGVS nomenclature (I'll use available online tools for this, but the accuracy depends on the quality of the provided information).
3.  Identify the disease and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term (again, needing the text to identify it).
4.  Populate the JSON structure according to the format described.
5.  Return the fully populated JSON output.

**Example Placeholder (Assuming a Hypothetical Article - You MUST provide the real text!)**

Let's *pretend* the provided article contained the following (very simplified) information:

*   **Gene:** *FAM50A*
*   **Variant:**  c.892C>T (identified as likely pathogenic)
*   **Disease:** "Early-Onset Ataxia" (linked to FAM50A mutations)
*   **Experiment:** Western Blot analysis on patient-derived fibroblasts.
*   **Control:**  Wild-type control fibroblasts.
*   **Result:** Reduced protein expression in patient fibroblasts.

Here's a sample JSON output *based on this placeholder information.*  **This is NOT the answer - this is to illustrate how the result will look.**
