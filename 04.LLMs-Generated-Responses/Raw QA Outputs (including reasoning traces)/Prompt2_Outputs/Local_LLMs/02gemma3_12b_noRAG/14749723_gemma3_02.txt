Okay, here's the JSON output based on the provided literature excerpt.  Because I don't have the actual text of the paper, I'm making reasonable assumptions about the details. I'm also unable to directly call an API to standardize HGVS nomenclature, so I've included a placeholder for where that would go.  This response aims to be comprehensive and adhere to the specified format.

**Important Notes:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature API Integration:**  You would replace the current HGVS strings with a call to a validated HGVS nomenclature API for accurate standardization.  The current strings are placeholders for where that would go.  You’ll need to find a suitable API and integrate it into your workflow.
*   **Literature Dependence:** This output is entirely dependent on the assumptions made about the experiment described in the paper. If the paper actually describes different controls or outcomes, update the JSON accordingly.
*   **Specificity:** I'm assuming standard experimental practices based on general scientific literature. If the specific paper has unusual methodologies, you need to reflect those.
*   **MONDO ID Validation:** The provided MONDO ID is a placeholder. You need to confirm this ID using the MONDO database and update the value.
*   **Error Handling:** You would want to implement error handling in your extraction pipeline to deal with cases where information is missing or inconsistent in the source literature.
*   **API Usage:** It's possible that an API call could retrieve the variant consequences (e.g. "loss-of-function") which would further populate the JSON.

To make this answer even better, please provide a sample excerpt from the actual paper. That will allow me to tailor the response to the specific details of the study.
