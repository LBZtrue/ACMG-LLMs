Okay, I'd be happy to process the provided literature and generate the JSON output based on your instructions. **Please provide the literature text.** I need the content of the articles to extract the information.

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Extract all relevant information (variants, disease, experimental details).
2.  Standardize HGVS nomenclature (I'm assuming I'm able to use an online tool or API for this - please specify if a specific tool should be used or if you want me to note the original).
3.  Retrieve the MONDO ID (again, I'll need to access an online resource - specify if a preferred one is available or let me know how to handle this).
4.  Fill in all the JSON fields based on the extracted information and using the formatting and structure you've defined.
5.  Present the complete JSON output.

**I'm ready when you are! Please paste the literature text.**
