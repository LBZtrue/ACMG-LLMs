Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature and generate the JSON output. Please provide the text of the literature. I will then analyze it according to the provided instructions and format the results into the specified JSON structure. I will do my best to extract all relevant information and accurately represent it.

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  **Identify Variants:** Extract gene names, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS:** Use a standard HGVS nomenclature converter to ensure consistency.
3.  **Determine Disease:** Identify the disease being studied and retrieve its corresponding MONDO term (using an online resource if necessary).
4.  **Analyze Experimental Methods:** Extract details of materials, readouts, controls, replicates, statistics, and thresholds.
5.  **Assess Assay Approval:** Determine if the experimental protocol is generally used for the disease.
6.  **Format into JSON:** Assemble the data into the JSON structure.
