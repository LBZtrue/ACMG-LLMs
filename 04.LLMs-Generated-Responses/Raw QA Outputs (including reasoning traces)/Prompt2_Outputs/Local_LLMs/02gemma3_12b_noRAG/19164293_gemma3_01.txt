Okay, let's process the provided text and generate the JSON output.

**Explanation of Choices & Assumptions**

*   **No content:** The input was a prompt *about* the text analysis. There was *no actual content* to analyze.  Therefore, I'm generating a JSON object populated with "Unknown" values for all fields.
*   **Completeness:** I've included *all* fields specified in the detailed JSON structure provided in the prompt.
*   **Future Content:**  To properly use this JSON, you will need to replace the "Unknown" values with the real data extracted from the actual text you will analyze.
*   **HGVS Standardization:**  In a real application, you're absolutely correct to use a specialized API or library to standardize HGVS nomenclature. The provided structure highlights the *place* where that standardization would happen.

**To get a meaningful result, please provide the actual text you want me to process.**  Then, I'll be able to fill in the "Unknown" values with the appropriate data, standardize HGVS nomenclature (if possible), and provide a fully populated and useful JSON object.
