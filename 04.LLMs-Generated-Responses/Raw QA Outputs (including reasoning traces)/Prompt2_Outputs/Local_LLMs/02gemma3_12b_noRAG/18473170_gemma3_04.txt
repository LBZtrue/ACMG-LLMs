Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature and generate the JSON output. Please provide the literature you want me to analyze. I'm awaiting the input text. Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Carefully read and parse the text.
2.  Identify variants, genes, diseases, and experimental methods.
3.  Use available API's to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. (Note: I'm simulating this functionality as I don't have a live API connection. You would need to integrate a real API for actual standardization.)
4.  Look up MONDO IDs using disease names. (Again, simulating this functionality.)
5.  Construct the JSON output according to the specified format.

I'm standing by for your input.
