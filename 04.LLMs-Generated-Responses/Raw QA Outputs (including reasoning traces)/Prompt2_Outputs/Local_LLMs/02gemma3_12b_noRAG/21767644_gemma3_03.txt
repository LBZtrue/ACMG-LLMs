Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since no actual literature was provided, I will use the example papers listed in your instructions and generate the JSON output. I'm using the same assumption from the example provided earlier.  I will generate the JSON based on the following literature:

**Literature:** "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line. This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function. Three biological replicates were performed. Each sample was run in triplicate. Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control. Empty vector was used as a negative control. Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A. Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 considered normal. Protein expression less than 50% on day 7 considered abnormal. The assay is routinely performed and accepted for characterizing protein expression changes in this setting."

**Important Considerations & Explanation:**

*   **Lack of Explicit Data:**  Since I received no actual scientific text, the generated JSON is based solely on the hypothetical literature described in your prompt. I'm making assumptions about the specifics.
*   **MONDO Term:** I retained the placeholder `MONDO:0012345` as I have no way to look this up. In a real scenario, I would need an external database/API to resolve this to the appropriate term.
*   **Validation Controls/Statistical Analysis:**  I assumed both were in place but did not have count information or analysis methods, I filled with N/A.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:**  If you provide actual text, I will dynamically populate the JSON structure with extracted data, standardized HGVS nomenclature, proper MONDO terms, and accurate descriptions.
*   **Customization:**  I can tailor the JSON structure and content further based on any specific requirements or data formats you need.

Provide the actual literature, and I will give you a much more accurate and complete answer.
