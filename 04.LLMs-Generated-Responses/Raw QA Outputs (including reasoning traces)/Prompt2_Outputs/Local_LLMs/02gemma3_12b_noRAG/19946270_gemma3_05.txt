Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate the JSON output based on the instructions. Please provide the text from the scientific literature you want me to analyze. I will do my best to extract all the relevant information and format it into the required JSON structure.

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  **Read and Understand:** Carefully read the provided text.
2.  **Extract Data:** Identify variants, diseases, experimental methods, materials, controls, results, and other relevant information.
3.  **Standardize HGVS nomenclature**: Utilize a HGVS nomenclature converter API (I'm assuming it's available for the task) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature.
4.  **Retrieve MONDO ID**: If the disease name is found, I'd attempt to query a MONDO database (or a service that provides MONDO ID lookup) to retrieve the corresponding term number.
5.  **Construct JSON:** Structure the extracted information into the JSON format as defined in your prompt.
6.  **Return JSON:** Provide the completed JSON output.

**Waiting for your text!**
