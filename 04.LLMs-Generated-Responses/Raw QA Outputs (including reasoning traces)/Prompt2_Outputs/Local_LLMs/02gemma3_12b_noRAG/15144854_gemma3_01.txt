Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since no specific literature was provided, I will fabricate a small, representative piece for demonstration purposes. This will allow me to showcase the complete workflow and output in the requested JSON format.

**Fabricated Literature Snippet:**

"We investigated the impact of mutations in the *APP* gene in familial Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, we focused on the variant c.670G>A (p.Ala224Thr) and its effect on amyloid-beta production. HEK293 cells were transfected with cDNA containing either the wild-type *APP* or the c.670G>A variant.  Western blotting was performed, using three biological replicates. Each sample was run in duplicate. Wild-type *APP* cDNA served as a positive control. We observed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in amyloid-beta 40 production for cells transfected with the c.670G>A variant compared to the wild-type control. The amount of amyloid-beta 42 remained unchanged. Two known pathogenic *APP* mutations were used for validation, and one known benign variant served as a control.  The threshold for normal Amyloid-beta40 production was determined to be between 50-100% of the wildtype control."

**Explanation of Choices and Assumptions:**

*   **MONDO Term:** I used MONDO:0002570 for "Familial Alzheimer's disease".
*   **Negative Control:**  No explicit negative control was mentioned, so I populated with “N/A”
*   **Statistical Analysis:**  The literature simply stated p < 0.05.
*   **Approved Assay:** I'm assuming, given the standard nature of the experiment, that this is a standard assay.
*   **Thresholds**: Abnormal threshold was infered from normal and comparison.

**Important:** To properly execute this process, you will need to replace the fabricasted literature with the actual literature you want me to analyze. The MONDO term may also need to be updated to match the literature. Also, since I cannot access external databases or APIs, I will not be performing the actual HGVS standardization; I'm providing the pre-standardized nomenclature for demonstration.
