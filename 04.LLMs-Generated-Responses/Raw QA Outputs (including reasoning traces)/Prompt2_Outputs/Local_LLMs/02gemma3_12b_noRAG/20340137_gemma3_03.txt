Okay, here's the JSON output based on the provided literature excerpt. Because I don't have the actual text of the articles, I am making reasonable assumptions based on common practices and the provided examples. I'm using placeholder API calls for HGVS standardization and MONDO term retrieval.  **Please replace the placeholder calls with actual API calls when using this.**

**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**

1. **Replace Placeholder API Calls:**  You *must* replace the symbolic `HGVS` calls with actual API calls.
2. **Adapt to Your Literature:** This JSON is a template. Adjust the descriptions, conclusions, and all other details to accurately reflect your actual literature.
3. **MONDO Database:** Use the MONDO database to verify and obtain the official MONDO term.  If the disease isn’t listed, you might need to request a new term.
4. **Validation Controls:** The absence of validation controls (P/LP and B/LB) is noted. If the literature describes validation controls, be sure to add that information.
5. **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling in your code to manage cases where API calls fail or data is missing.
6. **Source:** Specify the source of all thresholds and parameters.
