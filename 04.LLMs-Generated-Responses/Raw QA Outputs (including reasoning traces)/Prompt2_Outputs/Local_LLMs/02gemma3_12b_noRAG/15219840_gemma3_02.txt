Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since I don't have any literature provided yet, I'm going to work with the example provided in the prompt, which involves variants in the TP53 gene, Hereditary Myopathy (MONDO:0012345), and a Western Blot assay. After producing the JSON, I will wait for you to provide a piece of literature for me to process.

I'm now waiting for you to provide the text of the literature you'd like me to analyze. Please provide the text, and I will do my best to extract the relevant information and format it into the JSON structure.
