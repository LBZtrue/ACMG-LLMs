Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate the JSON output. Here's the JSON output based on the given text.  I'm assuming the text refers to the entire provided document and extracts relevant information. Please provide the text for me to analyze and produce the JSON output.

**Please provide the text now.**

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  **Read and Analyze:** Carefully read the provided text.
2.  **Extract Information:**  Identify and extract the relevant information as specified in your instructions (gene, variant details, disease, experimental methods, etc.).
3.  **Standardize HGVS:** Use a hypothetical HGVS standardization API (since I don't have a real one) to ensure correct formatting.  I'd explicitly mention "Standardized via hypothetical API" to avoid ambiguity.
4.  **Retrieve MONDO Term:**  I will use a search-like query (simulating a MONDO database search) to find the corresponding MONDO term (I can't actually interact with a database). I will note that it's a simulated search.
5.  **Construct JSON:**  Organize the extracted and standardized information into the JSON structure you're requesting, filling in the sections for each experiment method, material used, and assay method.
6.  **Output JSON:** Provide the complete JSON output.
