Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since no literature was provided, I will generate a hypothetical response based on the literature provided in the example prompt, expanded upon to demonstrate the full extraction and formatting process.  I'm assuming the literature describes experiments studying a variant in the *SQSTM1* gene related to Autoinflammatory Disease.  I will also use hypothetical details for the experimental procedures and results.  I'm going to create a moderately complex example to show how all the fields would be populated.

**Important Notes:**

*   **No Actual Literature:** This is a *hypothetical* response based on a manufactured scenario. A real-world response would require parsing actual literature.
*   **MONDO Retrieval:**  I've used a placeholder MONDO term. A proper implementation would query the MONDO database programmatically.
*   **Variant Standardization:** I'm not including comprehensive variant standardization here, but a real process would use tools to ensure consistent nomenclature.
*   **API Calls:** In a complete solution, there would be API calls to external databases for variant annotation and MONDO term retrieval.
*   **Error Handling:** A robust system would include error handling for cases where information is missing or ambiguous.
*   **Assay Method Variability:**  The "Approved Assay" field is subjective and would depend on the specific research context.

This comprehensive example demonstrates how a process would extract and organize data based on the defined JSON format.  Provide actual literature for a more tailored and accurate response.
