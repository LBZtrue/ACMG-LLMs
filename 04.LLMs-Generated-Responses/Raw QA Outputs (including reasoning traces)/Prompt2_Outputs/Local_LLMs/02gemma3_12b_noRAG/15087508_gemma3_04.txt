Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate the JSON output. However, **I need the actual text of the scientific literature** to perform the extraction and formatting. I cannot proceed without the text itself.

Once you provide the literature, I will:

1.  **Identify Variants:** Locate all mentions of gene alterations (e.g., c.XXXXY>Z).
2.  **Standardize HGVS:** Use a suitable tool/API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature.  (Note: I will need access to one during execution, or I will have to make assumptions, which will be noted).
3.  **Extract Disease Information:** Find the disease being studied.
4.  **Determine MONDO ID:**  Search the MONDO database (I'm assuming online access or a suitable data dump is available).  If not, I will mark this as "N/A".
5.  **Extract Experimental Details:**  Carefully analyze the methods used, material sources, controls, replicates, and results.
6.  **Populate the JSON:** Organize all extracted information into the structure you provided.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:** I will aim to standardize HGVS nomenclature. However, without a dedicated tool or API, there may be minor inaccuracies.
*   **MONDO Database Access:** Retrieving MONDO IDs requires access to the MONDO database. If access is unavailable, I'm will mark this as "N/A."
*   **Complexity:** Some papers are complex, and some details may be ambiguous. I will do my best to interpret correctly, but my interpretation may not always perfectly reflect the original text. I will denote any uncertain interpretations with notes.
*   **Context:** Some details might be implied rather than explicitly stated.  I'll note these interpretations clearly.

**Please provide the text now, and I will begin the process.**
