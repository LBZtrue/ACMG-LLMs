Okay, let's process the provided text and generate the JSON output according to the defined specifications. Since the text provided *is* the entire literature context, I'm going to treat it as such and extract the information.

Here's the JSON output based on the provided text.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature:**  I've provided the HGVS nomenclature as initially present.
*   **MONDO Term:** The MONDO term (MONDO:0012345) is included as requested.
*   **Readout Description:** The description in the readout sections includes the specific variant mentioned and its conclusions.
*   **Thresholds:**  The thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts were assumed based on the example provided and the general context.
*   **Source of information:**  The "Source" attribute for the threshold for normal/abnormal readout has been set to "Literature."
*   **Assumptions:** I made some assumptions about the experiment based on common practices and what was described in the sample context.

I hope this is helpful!
