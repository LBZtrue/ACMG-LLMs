Okay, I'm ready. Let's analyze the provided literature and generate the JSON output.

**Please provide the content of the literature.** I need the text from the paper to extract the relevant information. Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Identify all variants mentioned, and standardize their HGVS nomenclature.
2.  Determine the disease being studied.
3.  List experimental methods and extract all the required details.
4.  Generate a JSON output adhering to the specified structure.

I am looking forward to receiving the text so I can begin the analysis.
