Okay, here's the JSON output based on the provided text, formatted according to your requirements.  I'm assuming the full text you're referring to is the entire content of the provided article that you intend for me to process. As I don't have the actual document content, I will generate the response as best as possible based on the text you provided within your prompt.  I will make logical assumptions about the experimental details to fulfill the prompt.  If this answer is incomplete or inaccurate, please provide the article text.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Missing Information:**  I’m making assumptions about experimental conditions and results where specifics were absent in your initial request. To refine this significantly, provide the full article.
*   **Variant Identification:** I could only extract two variants as that was the content available.
*   **HGVS Standardization:**  The provided text suggests the use of HGVS nomenclature. The actual conversion to a standard HGVS annotation (including the correct reference sequence) would require specialized tools and databases.
*   **MONDO Retrieval:** I've placed "MONDO:0012345" here based on your example. You would need to use a MONDO database query to definitively retrieve the correct term for "Hereditary Myopathy".
