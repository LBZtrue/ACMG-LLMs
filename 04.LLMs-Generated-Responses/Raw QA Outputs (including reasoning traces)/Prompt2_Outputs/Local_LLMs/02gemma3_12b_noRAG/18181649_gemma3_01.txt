Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. However, **you haven't provided the literature text itself**. I need the content of the scientific paper, article, or report you want me to analyze.

Please provide the text you want me to extract information from. I'm prepared to follow your instructions and generate the JSON output once you give me the source material.

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  Extract the relevant information as specified in your instructions.
2.  Standardize HGVS nomenclature (I'm assuming access to a HGVS nomenclature tool/API would be ideal, but I'll do my best with common knowledge).
3.  Search for the disease name and attempt to retrieve the MONDO term.
4.  Populate the JSON structure with the extracted data.
