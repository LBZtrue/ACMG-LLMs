Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature and generate the JSON output. Since no literature was actually provided, I will use the example papers you listed as input. Let's assume these papers are:

1.  **Garcia et al. (2021). "Mutations in SMN1 lead to Spinal Muscular Atrophy."** This paper describes mutations in the *SMN1* gene causing Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Specifically, they investigate the c.445G>A variant. They use Western blots and qPCR.  Wild-type cDNA is the positive control, empty vector is the negative. They note that protein levels are reduced by 70% compared to the wild-type.
2.  **Lee et al. (2022). "Novel mutations in the XRN1 gene result in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome."**  This study explores *XRN1* gene mutations and their association with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.  They employ sequencing, Western blots and Immunofluorescence.  They show reduced protein levels and altered cellular localization with the c.1234A>T mutation.

Here's the generated JSON output based on these assumed papers. I will include the relevant details from each study.  Because I don't have active API access for HGVS standardization, I will provide the initial HGVS nomenclature and the standardized version where possible (based on common conversion rules).

**Important Notes:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:**  I'm providing the *initial* HGVS nomenclature based on common patterns. A real API would be needed for definitive standardization.
*   **Missing Information:** I'm making assumptions about aspects like biological/technical replicates, and statistical methods where the papers didn't explicitly state them. In a real analysis, these details should be verified in the original publications.
*   **MONDO ID:**  I have populated the MONDO IDs based on my understanding. Confirm these against the actual MONDO database for accuracy.
*   **Specificity:** I tried to be as specific as possible with the descriptions, but further context from the papers would allow for even more detail.
*   **Real Literature Required:**  The most crucial point is that I need the *actual text of the papers* to produce a truly accurate and complete JSON output.  This response is based on assumed content to demonstrate the process. Provide the papers, and I'm able to create the full JSON structure.
