Okay, let's process the provided text and generate the JSON output.

**Input Literature:**

"The α-synuclein gene (SNCA) encodes a protein that is a major component of Lewy bodies, a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD). A common missense variant, SNCA c.2091A>G (p.Lys697Arg), has been implicated in late-onset PD. To investigate the impact of this variant, we performed Western blot analysis of lysates from patient-derived fibroblasts expressing either wild-type SNCA or the c.2091A>G variant. Cells were cultured in standard conditions. Wild-type cDNA served as a positive control, while vector-only cells were the negative control. Three biological replicates were conducted for each condition.  Each blot was run with two technical replicates.  The protein expression levels for the p.Lys697Arg variant were found to be approximately 60% of the wild-type levels. The experiment also measured tau protein from the same fibroblasts. Further analysis of this variant was conducted with a validation control set containing 1 pathogenic variant and 2 benign variants. The results suggest a partial loss of function for the c.2091A>G variant."

**Explanation of Choices and Assumptions:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** Used the provided nomenclature directly.
*   **MONDO ID:**  I'm assuming the MONDO ID for Parkinson's disease is `MONDO:0003844` (based on common usage).
*   **Thresholds:** The text doesn't provide explicit thresholds for normal/abnormal results. I'm marking both as "N/A", and providing an assumed threshold of 50% for the abnormal readout.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** The text does not mention any specific statistical analysis methods.
*   **Approved Assay**: No indication provided in the passage.
*   **Custom values:** Some values were assumed due to the absence of information. This is indicated with 'Custom'.
