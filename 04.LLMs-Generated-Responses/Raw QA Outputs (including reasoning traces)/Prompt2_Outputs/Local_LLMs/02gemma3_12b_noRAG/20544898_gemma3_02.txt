Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. Given the lack of specific literature text, I'm going to generate a response based on the provided instructions and a hypothetical scenario using the provided example. I will assume the provided example text in the prompt is a starting point for the format.

**Important Notes:**

*   **This response is based on a hypothetical scenario.** To provide a truly accurate response, I need the actual text of the scientific literature you are referencing.
*   **MONDO terms:** I'm assuming `MONDO:0012345` is the correct term for Hereditary Myopathy. You should verify this with the actual MONDO database.
*   **HGVS Standardization**: The HGVS nomenclature was initially provided in the instructions and provided examples. If a database has more accurate data it should be used.
*   **Thresholds:** The provided "normal" and "abnormal" thresholds are educated guesses. Actual thresholds will be determined from experimental data.
*   **More Variants:** I added a second variant in the TP53 gene for illustrative purposes.
*   **Validation Control Counts:** I made up numbers for the validation controls. Replace with the correct numbers from the literature.
*   **Statistical analysis method:** I expanded on the provided information for more context.
