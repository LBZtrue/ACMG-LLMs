Okay, I'll process the provided text and generate the JSON output according to your instructions. Since you have not provided the literature to process, I will generate a sample JSON output based on the information given in the prompt (e.g., TP53 variant, Hereditary Myopathy, Western Blot assay). I will assume a hypothetical literature description to populate the fields. **Please replace this with the actual data extracted from your literature.**

**Key points and instructions for use:**

1. **Replace with your data:** This is a *sample* output.  You **must** replace the text within the JSON with the information extracted from your actual literature.
2. **MONDO term:** Look up the correct MONDO term in the MONDO database if you're not sure.
3. **Variants Include Description:**  Ensure this accurately describes what is stated in the literature regarding the effect of the variant.
4. **Molecular Effect:** Be precise in specifying the molecular effect (e.g., complete loss of function, partial loss of function, gain of function).
5. **Thresholds:**  Define the thresholds based on the literature; if not provided, use appropriate standard.
6. **Validation Controls:** State whether validation controls were implemented and the number.
7. **Statistical Analysis:**  Specify the statistical test used.
8. **Accuracy**: Double-check all values and descriptions for accuracy.

To give you a more accurate answer, please provide the actual literature you are analyzing.
