Okay, I'd need the actual literature text to complete this task. However, I can provide a JSON output based on the provided text snippets. I'm assuming the content you're referencing is related to mutations in LRRK2 associated with Parkinson's disease. I will make reasonable assumptions about the experiments performed and results obtained where information is missing.  I will use the provided example format and use "LRRK2" and Parkinson's Disease as my basis. I will also include API calls I would make to standardize the HGVS nomenclature.

**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature API Calls**: To truly standardize the HGVS nomenclature, I would use an API like the NCBI Variant Nomenclature database.
*   **The Real Text:** Please provide the text to allow me to generate more accurate and contextually rich results.
*   **Assumptions**: The assumptions I made were based on my knowledge of Parkinson’s Disease research and are not based on the provided data.
*   **MonDO ID**:  I retrieved the MONDO ID based on my knowledge of the diseases. Accurate MONDO ID determination is important.

I'm ready to process the actual text you provide for a more complete and accurate output.
