Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text. Since I don't have any text to work with, I will create a sample JSON response based on the following scenario:

**Scenario:** The provided text describes a study investigating the role of DJ-1 in Parkinson's Disease. A variant, c.123A>G (p.Met41Val) in the *DJ-1* gene is investigated via Western blot and cell viability assays. The MONDO term for Parkinson's Disease is MONDO:0003816.

Here's the generated JSON response:

**Important Notes:**

*   **Replace with Actual Data:** I need the text you want me to parse to provide a specific and accurate response. The above is a demonstration based on a hypothetical scenario.
*   **HGVS Standardization:**  The HGVS nomenclature provided is formatted according to commonly accepted practices.
*   **MONDO Term Retrieval:** To automatically retrieve MONDO terms from a database would require programmatic access to the MONDO database API. This response assumes I could perform that lookup.
*   **Thresholds:** The thresholds included are based on the hypothetical scenario and general scientific knowledge. They should be adjusted based on the actual data and context.
*   **Multiple Experiments:** I'm including two experiments as an example.
*   **Approved Assay**: This field requires more information about the typical experimental protocols used for investigating the disease of interest.
