Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Please provide the text of the scientific publication you want me to analyze. I will then extract the relevant information and format it according to the JSON structure you defined.  I'm prepared to do the following:

1. **Identify Variants:**  Extract gene names, HGVS nomenclature (and standardize them), and associated cDNA/protein changes.
2. **Disease Identification:** Determine the disease under investigation and retrieve the MONDO ID.
3. **Experimental Methods:** Detail the experimental procedures, materials, readouts, controls, and analyses.
4. **Standardization & Formatting:** Structure the information in the specified JSON format, including filling in "N.D." (Not Determined) when information is missing.
5. **Customized results:** Provide the results in the JSON format as you described.

**Please provide the text now.**  I'm looking forward to processing it.
