Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since no literature was provided, I will use the information from the prompt (particularly the example) to construct a JSON output.  I'm prioritizing creating a detailed response that demonstrates the expected format and level of detail.

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **No Literature Provided:** I've used the example given in the prompt.  To provide a *real* answer, you **must provide the actual text of the scientific literature**.
* **HGVS Standardization:**  The prompt asked for HGVS standardization.  I have assumed that the provided HGVS nomenclature in the example *is* standardized.  Real-world application would require using a proper HGVS nomenclature converter.
* **MONDO Retrieval:** I have directly used the MONDO term that was provided in the example. To obtain the correct MONDO term, querying the MONDO database is necessary.
* **Thresholds:**  I'm using the literature values for thresholds. In cases where they are not available, I would need to define reasonable thresholds based on scientific knowledge.  A "Source" for the threshold is important for traceability.
* **Molecular Effect:** I’m interpreting the description "structural change in the protein, affecting its function" and assigning "partial loss-of-function" as a plausible Molecular Effect.
* **Approximations:**  I'm making informed guesses based on the example.  The prompt is incredibly detailed, requiring a great deal of interpretation and inference.
* **Future Improvement:** With real literature, I could perform more sophisticated natural language processing to extract these details automatically.

To provide a meaningful result, please provide the text of the scientific article you wish me to process.
