Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature and generate the JSON output. Since you haven't provided the actual literature text, I'm going to use the example you gave (TP53 variant, Hereditary Myopathy) and *expand* on it to demonstrate how I would fill out all the fields in the JSON structure. I'm also going to add some plausible details.

```json

**Key improvements and explanations:**

* **More detail:** I've added realistic details about cell culture conditions, plasmid constructs, control experiments, statistical analysis, and validation controls to illustrate a complete experimental protocol.  This reflects how a thorough scientific study would be conducted.
* **Specifics for Thresholds:** Added specific percentage thresholds for normal/abnormal readout based on control groups.
* **Approval Description:**  Added a sentence to the "Approved assay" section justifying why the method is considered standard.
* **MONDO Retrieval:** In a real-world application, I would include code to automatically query the MONDO database using the disease name to retrieve the corresponding term.
* **HGVS Standardization:** I'm assuming the initial HGVS nomenclature was provided in a preliminary format.  A proper workflow would involve using a variant annotation tool to convert to a canonical HGVS notation.
* **Error Handling:**  In a production environment, error handling (e.g., what happens if a MONDO term isn't found) would be essential.

**To use this effectively, please provide the actual literature text.  I can then generate a much more accurate and useful JSON output tailored to that specific information.**  Also, tell me if you want any specific aspects emphasized or different assumptions made.
