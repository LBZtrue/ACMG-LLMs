Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text.  Please provide the text from the scientific literature you want me to analyze and format into the JSON structure you've described. I need the text itself to perform the extraction and formatting.

Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  **Identify Variants:** Extract gene names, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS:** (I will need access to an HGVS standardization tool or API - I will simulate this for now by ensuring consistency within the text provided. If you have a specific tool preference, let me know).
3.  **Identify Disease:** Extract the disease name and use that to search for the appropriate MONDO term (I'll simulate this by providing a placeholder MONDO term if I don't have direct access to a MONDO database).
4.  **Extract Experiment Details:** Extract all information regarding the experimental methods, including materials, readouts, replicates, controls, statistical methods, and thresholds.
5.  **Formulate JSON:** Assemble the information into the required JSON format.
6.  **Provide Output:** Return the JSON output for your review.

I'm eager to get started – please provide the text!
