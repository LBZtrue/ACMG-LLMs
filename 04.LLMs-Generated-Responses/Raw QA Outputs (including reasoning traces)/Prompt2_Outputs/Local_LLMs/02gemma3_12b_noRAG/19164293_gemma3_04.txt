Okay, here's the JSON output based on the provided literature snippets.  I'm assuming the provided text is representative of the *entire* provided literature, and I'm making some reasonable assumptions where information is missing. I'm also not able to actually run a HGVS standardization API in this environment; I'm providing what *would* be generated *after* that step.  I'll include notes at the end outlining the assumptions made.

**Assumptions Made:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:** This output *assumes* that the preliminary HGVS nomenclature from the provided literature has been standardized through an HGVS API. The values given are what *would* be output after that step.
*   **Disease MONDO ID:** I'm assuming Parkinson's Disease is the disease being studied in the context of the mentioned experiments. The MONDO ID is based on that assumption.
*   **Readout Description:** I included the details about the variant's effect on mRNA levels in the readout descriptions, based on the information provided.
*   **Validation Controls:** The provided text does not mention validation controls. I'm marking them as "No" and setting "Counts" to null.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Assuming a t-test based on common practices.
* **Approved Assay:** Assuming that the method is routinely used in scientific experiments.
* **Thresholds:** Based on the available data, I've tried to create some reasonable thresholds based on standard deviations.
