Okay, I'd like to process the provided text and construct the JSON output as requested.  However, I need the literature content to work with. Please provide the actual text of the research paper or article. Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  **Identify Variants:** Extract gene names, initial HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Standardize HGVS:** Use a reliable HGVS nomenclature database (if accessible through an API or tool) to fully standardize the nomenclature. For this demonstration, I will assume the variants are correct as described.
3.  **Disease Identification:** Determine the disease under investigation.
4.  **MONDO Retrieval:** Look up the corresponding MONDO term.  (I'll need an internet connection and access to a MONDO database/API for this.  Without it, I'm going to list MONDO as "N/A").
5.  **Experiment Details:** Extract details about the experimental methods: materials, readouts, replicates, controls, statistical methods, and thresholds.
6.  **Approved Assay Determination:** Assess if the method is a standard approach for the disease.
7.  **Construct the JSON output.**

**Waiting for the Literature Content**

Once you provide the text, I'm ready to begin. I will format the response as a JSON object.
