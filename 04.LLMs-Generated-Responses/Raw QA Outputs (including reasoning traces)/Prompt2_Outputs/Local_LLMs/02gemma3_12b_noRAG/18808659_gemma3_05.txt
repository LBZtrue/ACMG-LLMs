Okay, let's process the provided text and generate the JSON output based on the provided instructions.

**Explanation & Notes:**

*   **The provided text is empty:** There is no actual text to process, other than the instructions. Therefore, I have filled the JSON fields with "N/A" (Not Applicable) as placeholders.  If you provide a piece of literature I can complete this properly.
*   **Standardization:** I assume that the API standardization will be performed outside of this response.  This process would take the preliminary HGVS nomenclature and convert it to a standardized form.
*   **MONDO Retrieval:** Retrieving the MONDO term would normally require a query to the MONDO database based on the "Hereditary Myopathy" disease name. This also is beyond the scope of the prompt and it is included as a placeholder.
*   **Assumptions:** Many fields are left as "N/A" because no information exists in the provided text. Filling these fields would require making assumptions or attempting to deduce information from the context.
*   **Scalability:** If there were multiple experiments described in the text, I would create multiple entries within the "Experiment Method" array.
