Okay, I'd be happy to analyze the provided text and generate the JSON output based on your instructions. However, **you have not provided any text to analyze.**  Please provide the literature you want me to process.

Once you give me the text, I will:

1.  Identify the genes and variants mentioned.
2.  Standardize the HGVS nomenclature (if necessary and possible with available tools/information).
3.  Find the corresponding MONDO ID for the disease.
4.  Extract all the experimental details, replicates, controls, and statistical methods.
5.  Create the JSON structure as specified in your prompt.

I'm ready when you provide the text!
