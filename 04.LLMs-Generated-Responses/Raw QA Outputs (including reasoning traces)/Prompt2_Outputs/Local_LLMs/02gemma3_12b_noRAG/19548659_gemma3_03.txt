Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. Since no literature was given, I will generate a sample response based on the provided structure and examples. This will show you exactly how I would format the output once you provide the text to be analyzed.

Let's assume the following scenario, based on the problem description:

**Hypothetical Literature Excerpt:** "We investigated the role of mutations in the *SNCA* gene in the pathogenesis of familial Parkinson's disease.  The variant c.1234A>G (p.N412A) was found to significantly reduce alpha-synuclein protein levels in HEK293 cells. Three independent biological replicates were performed. A control vector expressing wild-type SNCA was included.  Protein levels were quantified by ELISA, with expression considered normal if above 80% relative to the control, and abnormal if below 30%. ANOVA was used to analyze the data.  A pathogenic variant control (c.456T>C, p.S152P) was included to validate the assay."

Here's the JSON output reflecting the analysis:

**Explanation of Choices & Notes:**

*   **HGVS Standardization:** The provided example demonstrates the conversion of preliminary HGVS nomenclature into a more standardized format.  I would consult databases/tools to ensure accuracy and completeness.
*   **MONDO ID Retrieval:**  I would use a search to get the appropriate MONDO ID.  This is based on the provided disease name.
*   **'N/A' Values:** Where information was not available in the excerpt, I'm filling with "N/A" (Not Applicable).
*   **Molecular Effect:** This will be assessed from the context given in the excerpt and may be further validated.

Now, please provide the text you would like me to analyze, and I'll generate the appropriate JSON output.
