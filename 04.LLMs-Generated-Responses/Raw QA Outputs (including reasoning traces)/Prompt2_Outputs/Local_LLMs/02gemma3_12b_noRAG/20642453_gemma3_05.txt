Okay, I'm ready to process the provided text and generate the JSON output. Since you haven't provided the actual literature text, I will generate a sample JSON output based on the example you gave, expanding it with additional placeholders to show the level of detail expected. This will serve as a template and I'm ready to fill it with the content of the actual text once you provide it.

**Explanation and Next Steps:**

*   **Placeholders:** I have added some placeholders, especially in the `Description` fields, where you's find specific information from the source text. I've added a second assay, RT-PCR, to demonstrate expanding the complexity.
*   **MONDO term:** You're supposed to replace `"MONDO:0012345"` with the correct MONDO ID.
*   **Accuracy:** The accuracy of the output *heavily* depends on the content of the provided text. I can't determine the correct values without the actual text.
*   **More Assays:**  If there are more experimental methods, you can simply copy and paste the existing `Experiment Method` block and modify it.

**To proceed, please provide the text you want me to process. I will then replace the placeholders and complete the JSON output.**
