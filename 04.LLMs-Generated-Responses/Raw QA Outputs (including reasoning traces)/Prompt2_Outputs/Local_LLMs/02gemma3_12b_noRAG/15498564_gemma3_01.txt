Okay, I'm ready to process the provided literature. However, you haven't provided any literature! I need the text of the scientific article or passage to extract the information and format it into the JSON structure you're requesting.

**Please provide the text of the scientific article or passage. Once you do, I will:**

1.  **Read and understand the text.**
2.  **Extract the necessary information.**
3.  **Standardize HGVS nomenclature (though I'm limited in that I'll need to assume proper context).**
4.  **Retrieve MONDO terms using online search (if possible given the information in the text).**
5.  **Fill in the JSON template with the extracted and processed data.**

I'm looking forward to receiving the text so I can start working on your request.
