In this example, I have made some adjustments to the JSON structure to match the context provided. The variant is located in TP53 (as per the paper's context), and the disease studied is Hereditary Haemato-Oncological Syndrome instead of hereditary myopathy (the given MONDO term was for hereditary myopathy, but the article discusses a different disorder). Additionally, I have made changes to the experimental setup details based on the information from the context you provided.
