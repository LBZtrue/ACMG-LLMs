       "Variants Include": [
           {
               "Gene": "Unknown (As the context does not provide a specific gene name)",
               "variants": [
                   // Variant details to be filled based on the context from the literature
               ]
           }
       ],
       "Described Disease": {
           "Described Disease": "Unknown (As the context does not provide a specific disease name)",
           "MONDO": "Unknown"
       },
       "Experiment Method": [
           // Experiment details to be filled based on the context from the literature
       ]
   }

In this example, I have provided a placeholder structure for the JSON answer since the given context does not specify the gene name or disease. To fill in the appropriate information, you would need to find and extract the relevant details from the literature.
