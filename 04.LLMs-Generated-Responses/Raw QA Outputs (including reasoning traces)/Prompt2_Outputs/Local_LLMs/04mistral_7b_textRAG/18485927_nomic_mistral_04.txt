Based on the context and provided workflow, here is a summary of the steps to follow for analyzing the given article:

1. Read the article and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. In this case, the article mentions a variant in the TP53 gene with the preliminary HGVS nomenclature c.248G>A (p.G83D).

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API. You would then use an API to standardize the provided preliminary HGVS nomenclature, NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database. In this case, the article mentions "Hereditary Myopathy," and we would search the MONDO database for the corresponding term (e.g., "MONDO:0012345").

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results. In this example, the article mentions a Western Blot assay was used, so we would gather details such as material source (HEK293 cell line), readout type (quantitative), result descriptions (protein expression reduced by 50%), replicates (Yes), statistical analysis method (ANOVA), and thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts.

5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease. In this case, Western Blot is a commonly used assay to study many genetic diseases.

6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework. Using the example above, we would create a JSON object that includes the gene, variant(s), disease term, experimental details (including methods, results, replicates, controls, statistical analysis, and thresholds), and an approved assay status.

Here's an example of what the final JSON object might look like:
