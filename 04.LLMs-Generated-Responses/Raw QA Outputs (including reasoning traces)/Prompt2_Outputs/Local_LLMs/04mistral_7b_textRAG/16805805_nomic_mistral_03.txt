Title: Identification and Characterization of Variants in a Specific Gene Associated with a Certain Disease using Western Blot

1. Relevant variant information extraction:
   - The study identifies a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), associated with a disease named "Hereditary Myopathy."

2. HGVS nomenclature standardization:
   - After using an appropriate API, we can obtain the standardized HGVS nomenclature for the variant as NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.Gly83Asp).

3. Identification of the disease and retrieval of MONDO term:
   - The identified disease is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term as "MONDO:0012345."

4. Experimental method extraction and analysis:
   - The study uses Western Blot to characterize the variant.
   - Material source: HEK293 cell line
   - Readout type: Quantitative
   - Biological replicates: Yes (three biological replicates were performed)
   - Technical replicates: Yes (each sample was run in triplicate)
   - Positive control: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
   - Negative control: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
   - Validation controls P/LP: 2 validation controls were included for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants.
   - Validation controls B/LB: 1 validation control was included for benign or likely benign variants.
   - Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
   - Thresholds for normal and abnormal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 (Literature) and Protein expression less than 50% on day 7 (Literature), respectively.
   - Approved assay: Yes, Western Blot is generally used for studying this disease.
