Based on the provided context, here's a breakdown of how to interpret and generate an output for the given literature:

1. Extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. In this example, the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API. For this example, we already have the standardized HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database. In this case, the disease is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results. For this example, let's assume the following details:

   - Assay Method: Western Blot
   - Material Source: Cell line (HEK293)
   - Readout type: Quantitative
   - Biological replicates: Yes, performed 3 times
   - Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate
   - Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control
   - Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control
   - Validation controls P/LP: Yes, 2 validation controls were included for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants
   - Validation controls B/LB: Yes, 1 validation control was included for benign or likely benign variants
   - Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
   - Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 (derived from the literature)
   - Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7 (derived from the literature)
   - Approved assay: Yes, Western Blot is generally used for studying this disease.

5. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
