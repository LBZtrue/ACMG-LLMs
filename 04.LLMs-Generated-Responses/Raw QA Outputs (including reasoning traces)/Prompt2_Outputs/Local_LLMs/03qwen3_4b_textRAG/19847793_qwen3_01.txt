Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed abstract and introduction about a study on PINK1 mutations in Parkinson's disease. They want me to extract specific information into a structured JSON format, following their strict guidelines.

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract talks about mutations in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain of PINK1. But the exact HGVS nomenclature isn't given. The user wants me to standardize these using an API, but since I can't actually call an API here, I'll have to note that as N.D. because the literature doesn't provide specific HGVS codes. However, the example shows that even without the actual HGVS, the structure should be there. Wait, the user's example includes HGVS even if it's not present in the literature. Wait, in the example, they have HGVS as NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A, which is made up. But in the actual literature, the user's input doesn't mention specific HGVS codes. So maybe the answer should have "N.D." for HGVS since it's not provided. But the user's example shows that even if the literature doesn't have it, the structure is there. Hmm, the user says "for content not mentioned in the literature, use N.D." So in this case, the variants in the literature are just described as N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain mutants. So the HGVS would be N.D., but the cDNA and protein changes can be inferred from the description. Wait, the user's example uses a made-up HGVS, but in this case, the literature doesn't specify any specific HGVS. So the answer should have HGVS as N.D. for each variant. However, the user's example shows that even if the literature doesn't provide HGVS, the structure is present. So maybe the answer should have HGVS as N.D., but the cDNA change and protein change can be extracted from the text. The abstract says "mutants in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain were generated". So the gene is PINK1. The variants are in these regions. But the exact HGVS is not given, so I need to note that. The cDNA change and protein change would be inferred. But the user's example uses a specific cDNA change, but here, the literature doesn't specify. So perhaps the answer should have HGVS as N.D., and the cDNA and protein changes as N.D. But the user's example shows that even without the HGVS, the structure is there. However, the user's instruction says that the variants should be extracted, so maybe the answer should include the HGVS as N.D., but the cDNA and protein changes should be extracted from the text. Wait, the abstract says "N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain mutants". So the cDNA change is not specified, but the protein change is also not specified. Therefore, the answer should have HGVS as N.D., and the cDNA and protein changes as N.D. But the user's example includes a specific cDNA change. However, in this case, the literature doesn't provide specific HGVS, so the answer should have HGVS as N.D. But the user's instruction says that if the content is not mentioned, use N.D. So that's correct. Then, the disease is Parkinson's disease, and the MONDO term would be retrieved. The example shows MONDO:0012345, but the actual MONDO term for Parkinson's is MONDO:0006122. But since I can't call the API, I'll note that as N.D. But the user says to retrieve from the MONDO database. However, the user's example uses a placeholder. So in this case, the disease is Parkinson disease, and the MONDO term would be MONDO:0006122. But since I can't actually call the API, I'll have to put that as N.D. But the user's example shows that even if the term is not known, the structure is there. So maybe the answer should have MONDO as N.D. But the user's instruction says to retrieve from MONDO. However, the user's example shows that the MONDO is a placeholder. So perhaps the answer should have the disease as "Parkinson disease" and MONDO as N.D. But the user's example includes a MONDO term. So I need to check if the actual MONDO term for Parkinson's is known. Wait, the user's example uses a placeholder, so perhaps the answer should have the disease name as "Parkinson disease" and MONDO as N.D. But the user might expect that, but according to the example, even if the term is not known, it's placed as N.D. So the answer would have that.

Next, the experimental method. The study uses an in vitro model, which is an established method. The material used is cell lines, but the specific name isn't given. The readout type is quantitative, as the abstract mentions "reduced by 50%". The thresholds for normal and abnormal are not specified, so they would be N.D. But the user's example has thresholds. However, in the actual literature, the thresholds are not mentioned, so they should be N.D. The approved assay is "Yes" if it's a standard method. But the user's example says "Yes" for approved assay. However, in this case, the study uses an in vitro model, which is a standard method. So the approved assay would be "Yes".

Putting it all together, the answer should have the variants with HGVS as N.D., the disease as Parkinson disease, MONDO as N.D., and the experimental method with the described details, but with some fields as N.D. because the literature doesn't specify them.
