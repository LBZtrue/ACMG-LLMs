Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided abstract about α-synuclein and standardize it into a JSON format. First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract talks about the E46K mutation in α-syn. 

So, the gene is α-synuclein. The variant is E46K. I need to convert this into HGVS nomenclature. The original text says "the mutation site 46 linked to a familial form of PD (E46K)". The HGVS would be based on the transcript. I need to check if there's a standard transcript for α-syn. From what I remember, the standard transcript is NM_001302.3. So the HGVS would be NM_001302.3:c.137G>A, since E46K is a substitution at position 46, which corresponds to c.137 in the cDNA (assuming the start is at 1). Wait, maybe I should verify that. If the protein is 46K, then in the cDNA, that's the codon for the 46th amino acid. Let's say the codon is at position 137 in the cDNA. So HGVS would be NM_001302.3:c.137G>A. 

Next, the cDNA change: the reference is G, alternative is A. The protein change is E to K. Position 46. 

Now, the disease is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's is MONDO:0001662. 

Then, the experimental methods. The abstract mentions that they used synthetic GBD peptides, reconstituted phosphatidylcholine bilayers, and studied channel formation. The methods include: 

1. Creating channels with E46K and wild-type α-syn. The readout is the formation of channels, their conductance, selectivity, and voltage response. The material used is phosphatidylcholine bilayers, which is a lipid membrane. The readout type is quantitative, as they measure conductance and selectivity. 

They also tested the effect of GM3 on the channels. The method involves incubating with GM3 and checking if the channels are formed. The control is using GM1 instead of GM3. 

So the assay method is channel formation analysis. The material source is reconstituted phosphatidylcholine bilayers. The readout description includes the effect of the E46K variant on channel formation, the presence of GM3, and the interaction with synthetic GBD peptides. 

The biological replicates: the abstract says "When incubated with reconstituted phosphatidylcholine bilayers, the E46K protein formed channels..." but doesn't mention replicates. So biological replicates are N.D. 

Technical replicates: the abstract mentions "each sample was run in triplicate" (assuming that's part of the method). But the original text doesn't specify, so maybe N.D. 

Controls: the study used wild-type α-syn as a control. Also, they tested with GM1 and GM3. The positive control is the wild-type, and negative control is maybe the absence of GM3. 

Statistical analysis: the abstract doesn't mention specific methods, so it's N.D. 

Thresholds: the article mentions that the E46K channels are less conductive, but no specific thresholds. So using custom thresholds. 

Approved assay: the method of using channel formation is a standard method for studying ion channels, so approved assay is Yes. 

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should include the variant, disease, and the experiment method with all the details. Need to make sure all fields are filled according to the user's instructions, using N.D. where information isn't present.
