Okay, let's start by reading through the provided abstract carefully. The main focus is on Autosomal Recessive Juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) and the gene PARK2, which is associated with mutations causing AR-JP. The study mentions that parkin is involved in protein degradation as a ubiquitin-protein ligase working with UbcH7. Mutant parkins from AR-JP patients lose this activity, leading to protein accumulation and selective neural cell death without Lewy bodies.

First, I need to extract variant information. The abstract mentions that mutations in PARK2 cause AR-JP, but there's no specific variant listed. The user's example had a variant, but here, the text doesn't provide HGVS nomenclature. So, I should note that there's no specific variant mentioned, hence "N.D." for variants.

Next, the disease is AR-JP. I need to check MONDO for the corresponding term. Looking up, MONDO:0006253 is for Autosomal Recessive Juvenile Parkinsonism. So that's the MONDO ID.

For experimental methods, the abstract talks about parkin's role in ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. The methods mentioned include the use of mutant parkins from patients and the study of protein degradation. However, the text doesn't describe specific assays like Western Blot, cell lines, or statistical methods. The study might have used in vitro experiments with cell lines, but the details are not given. So, I'll mark those as N.D. unless there's a mention of a specific method.

The "Approved assay" is about whether the method is generally used. Since the text doesn't mention any specific assay methods, this would be N.D.

Putting it all together, the Variants Include section will have no entries. The disease is AR-JP with MONDO:0006253. The experimental methods are not detailed, so all fields under Experiment Method are N.D. except for the general mention of the study's approach.
