Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a scientific abstract about α-synuclein mutations and their effects on polymerization. They want me to extract variant info, disease terms, and experimental methods into a structured JSON.

First, I need to identify the variants mentioned. The abstract talks about E46K and A53T mutations. The gene is α-synuclein. The HGVS nomenclature should be standardized. But wait, the original text doesn't specify the transcript version. I need to infer that. Since α-synuclein is a well-known gene, maybe the transcript is NM_000305.1. Let me check that. The original text says "E46K" in the KTKEGV-type repeats. The cDNA change would be c.138G>A (assuming position 138, since E is at position 46 in the protein, which is 138 in cDNA? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the protein is 140 amino acids. The mutation is in the amino-terminal region. The E46K is a substitution of Glu at position 46. But how does that translate to cDNA? If the gene is α-synuclein, the cDNA would be NM_000305.1. The E46K would be a substitution at position 46 in the protein. The cDNA position would be 138 (since the first codon is 1-3, so position 46 is 138 in cDNA). So, c.138G>A (G to A at position 138). Then the protein change is p.E46K. The description in the context is "E46K mutation... increased the propensity to fibrillize."

Then the A53T mutation. Similarly, position 53 in the protein. So c.159G>C (assuming the codon for position 53 is 159 in cDNA). The protein change is p.A53T. The description is that this mutation had a greater effect than E46K.

Next, the disease. The abstract mentions that the mutations are related to disease. The disease here is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's is MONDO:0006128.

Now, the experimental methods. The abstract talks about the effect of these mutations on polymerization. The methods mentioned are probably in vitro fibrillation assays. The material used is α-synuclein, maybe in a cell line or purified protein. The readout is qualitative (like the ability to form fibrils) or quantitative (like the rate of polymerization). The description in the literature mentions that the E46K mutation increased fibrillization but less than A53T. The polymers have different ultrastructures. So, the readout is qualitative, like the presence of fibrils. The experiment might involve seeding or SDS-PAGE to detect fibrils. The study mentions that the effect of the mutations is consistent with the age of onset of disease, so the methods are probably in vitro, and the controls are wild-type and mutant proteins.

Now, for the JSON structure. The variants include E46K and A53T. The HGVS needs to be standardized. The cDNA positions are inferred. The protein changes are as per the text. The description in the input context is the original text.

For the disease, MONDO:0006128 is the term for Parkinson's.

The experiment method is likely the in vitro fibrillation assay. The material used is α-synuclein. The readout is qualitative. The result description includes both variants, their conclusions (Abnormal for both, but E46K has a less effect than A53T). The readout description should list both variants. The biological replicates are mentioned in the abstract? The original text says "It was demonstrated that the E46K mutation increased...". The abstract doesn't mention replicates, so N.D. for that. Technical replicates? The abstract doesn't say, so N.D. The controls are wild-type and mutant. The statistical analysis is not mentioned, so N.D. The thresholds for normal and abnormal are not specified, so I have to use custom. The approved assay is yes, because in vitro fibrillation is a standard method for studying protein aggregation.

Putting it all together in the JSON structure. Need to make sure that the HGVS is correctly formatted with the correct transcript. Also, the protein changes are correctly mapped.
