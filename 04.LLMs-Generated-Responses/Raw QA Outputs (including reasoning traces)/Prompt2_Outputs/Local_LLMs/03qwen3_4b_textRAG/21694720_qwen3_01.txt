Okay, let's start by looking at the abstract and introduction provided. The main focus is on Parkin, an E3-ubiquitin ligase involved in Parkinson's disease. The key points are about Parkin mutations leading to constitutive activity and the autoinhibition mechanism.

First, I need to extract genetic variants. The abstract mentions "pathogenic Parkin mutations," but the specific variants aren't detailed here. The introduction talks about mutations in the parkin gene, but the exact HGVS nomenclature isn't provided. Since the user wants HGVS standardized via API, but the input doesn't have specific variants, I'll note that as N.D.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease, specifically Autosomal Recessive Juvenile Parkinsonism. I need to find the MONDO term for that. From my knowledge, MONDO:0007334 is for Parkinson's disease, and MONDO:0007335 for Autosomal Recessive Juvenile Parkinsonism. But I should check if the literature mentions a specific term. The abstract says "Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism," so I'll use that.

For experimental methods, the literature discusses the role of Parkin's ubiquitin-like domain in autoubiquitination and the effect of mutations. The methods mentioned would be molecular biology techniques like expressing Parkin variants, possibly using cell lines, and assays to check activity. The abstract doesn't specify the exact methods, so fields like assay method, material used, etc., would be N.D. except for the general approach.

The "Readout description" needs to include all variants, but since there are none, it's N.D. The "Approved assay" would be N.D. because the methods aren't detailed enough.

Putting this all together, the JSON structure will have variants as N.D., the disease with MONDO terms, and experimental methods with N.D. for most fields. I need to make sure all required fields are present, even if they are N.D. where the literature doesn't specify.
