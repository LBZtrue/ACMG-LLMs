Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided abstract about Parkinson's disease and α-synuclein mutations. The main goal is to structure this into a JSON format as per the given template.

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract talks about three mutations: A30P, E46K, and A53T in α-synuclein. Each of these is associated with early-onset familial PD. I need to convert these into HGVS nomenclature. However, the abstract doesn't provide the exact transcript or cDNA positions, so I might need to infer based on standard conventions. But the user mentioned using APIs for standardization, so maybe I should note that the HGVS is not provided in the text and use "N.D." for those fields. Wait, the user said to extract what's in the literature. The abstract mentions the mutations but doesn't specify the exact HGVS notation. So I should indicate that HGVS is not provided and use "N.D." for those fields.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's. From my knowledge, MONDO:0001661 is the term for Parkinson's disease. But I should confirm that. The user wants the MONDO term retrieved, so I'll include that.

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions the 20S proteasome and liposomes. The methods involve in vitro cleavage of αSyn, fragmentation, conformation, and association reactions. The readout includes amyloid formation and oligomer formation. The results show that the proteasome truncates both wild-type and mutant αSyn, leading to accelerated fibrillization. However, there's no clear correlation between the mutations and amyloid formation. The soluble oligomers' formation rate correlates with the mutations. The wild-type also forms oligomers but slower.

Now, structuring this into the JSON. The variants section will have the three mutations, each with their HGVS (but since the text doesn't specify, I'll use "N.D." for HGVS). The cDNA and protein changes are given in the abstract as A30P, E46K, A53T. So for each, I'll map the positions. For example, A30P would be c.90A>G (assuming standard positions), but the abstract doesn't specify, so maybe the user expects the actual positions from the text. Wait, the text says "A30P, E46K, and A53T". The positions are in the protein, so the cDNA positions would be based on the gene's sequence. However, without the exact transcript, I can't assign the HGVS. The user's example shows that if the HGVS is not provided, it's "N.D." So I'll do that.

For the experimental methods, the method is the 20S proteasome and liposomes. The readout includes fragmentation, conformation, association reactions. The results show that all αSyns are fragmented, but the mutations don't correlate with amyloid formation. The oligomer formation rate does correlate. The wild-type also forms oligomers, but slower. So the readout description should include all the variants. The assay method is probably proteasome-mediated cleavage and liposome interaction. The material used is αSyn, maybe from the text, but the abstract doesn't specify a material source. So "Material Source" would be "Protein" or "Synuclein" and "Material Name" as "α-synuclein". The readout type is quantitative, since they're measuring rates and amounts.

The experimental replicates: the text mentions "three point mutations" but not replicates. The abstract says "the 20S proteasome produced the C-terminal fragments from both the mutant and wildtype αSyn." So maybe no replicates mentioned. The controls: the wild-type is used as a control, so positive control. Negative control might be a normal sample. The validation controls are not mentioned, so N.D.

Statistical analysis methods: the text doesn't mention, so N.D. Thresholds are not specified, so "N.D.".

Approved assay: The method of using proteasome and liposomes is standard in such studies, so "Yes".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the variants with HGVS as N.D., the disease as Parkinson's with MONDO term, and the experiment method details as per the analysis.
