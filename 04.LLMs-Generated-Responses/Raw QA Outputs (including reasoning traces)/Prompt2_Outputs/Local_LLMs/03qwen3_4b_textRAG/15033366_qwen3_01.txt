Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a scientific abstract and wants me to extract specific information into a structured JSON format. First, I need to parse the abstract to find all the variants mentioned. The abstract talks about different synuclein isoforms, including A30P and A53T mutants. 

Looking at the variants, the main ones are A30P and A53T. The gene here is synuclein, which has three isoforms: alpha, beta, and gamma. The problem mentions that the mutant A30P is associated with Parkinson's disease, and A53T is more potent. But wait, the original question is about the variants in the literature. The abstract mentions that all three isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma) are inhibitors of PLD2, and the A30P and A53T mutants are discussed. However, the exact HGVS nomenclature isn't provided. The user wants HGVS standardized, but the original text doesn't have specific cDNA positions. 

Wait, the abstract says "the Parkinson's disease-associated mutant A30P" and "the PD-associated mutant A53T". So these are variants in the alpha-synuclein gene. The HGVS would need to be standardized. However, the original text doesn't provide the exact cDNA positions, so maybe I need to use the information given. For example, A30P would be a point mutation at position 30, changing a codon. Similarly, A53T would be at position 53. But the original text doesn't specify the transcript, so I might need to use the standard HGVS notation. But the user wants me to use an API to standardize, but since I can't access external APIs, I need to infer based on the given info.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's is MONDO:0001664. So that's the disease term. 

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions in vitro experiments with PLD2 inhibition. The methods include analyzing mutations of alpha-synuclein to identify critical determinants. The experiments involve deletion of exons 4 and 6, and phosphorylation at certain residues. The readout is PLD2 inhibition. The methods include in vitro assays, possibly using cell lines or purified proteins. The original text doesn't mention specific materials like cell lines, so maybe "N.D." for Material Source. 

The readout type is qualitative or quantitative? The abstract mentions "inhibitory activity" which could be quantitative. The results include deletions of exons 4 and 6 leading to reduced inhibition, and phosphorylation affecting inhibition. The thresholds for normal and abnormal results aren't specified, so I'll set them as "N.D." based on the user's instruction. 

The approved assay would be whether the method is generally used for studying Parkinson's. Since the study is about PLD2 inhibition, which is a known pathway in Parkinson's, the method might be considered approved. 

Putting this all together, the variants are A30P and A53T in the alpha-synuclein gene. The disease is Parkinson's, and the experimental methods involve in vitro PLD2 inhibition assays with various mutations. The readouts are based on the inhibition activity, with specific results for each variant.
