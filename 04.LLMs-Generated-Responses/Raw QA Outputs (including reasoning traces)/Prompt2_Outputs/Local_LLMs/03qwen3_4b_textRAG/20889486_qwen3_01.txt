Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided abstract about Parkinson's disease and Parkin mutations. First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract talks about a Parkin RING domain mutant, specifically the C289G variant. 

So, the gene is PARK2, and the variant is C289G in the RING domain. I need to convert that into HGVS nomenclature. The original text says "Parkin RING domain mutant (C289G)", so the cDNA change is c.289C>G. The protein change would be p.C289G. I should check the transcript version. The Parkin gene is usually NM_001384.3, but I need to confirm. Wait, the abstract might not specify the transcript, so I'll have to use the standard one. Let me look up the correct transcript for Parkin. Oh, the PARK2 gene is known as NM_001384.3. So, the HGVS would be NM_001384.3:c.289C>G, leading to p.C289G.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease, which in MONDO is MONDO:0003075. The abstract mentions that the study is about Parkin mutations linked to Parkinson's. Now, the experimental methods: the study uses a mitochondrial uncoupler (carbonyl cyanide m-methylhydrazone) to induce mitophagy. They also mention the use of HSJ1a and DNAJB6 to rescue Parkin. The methods include assessing mitophagy, which involves checking the redistribution of Parkin and LC3 to depolarized mitochondria. 

The experimental methods here are likely Western blot and immunofluorescence. The material used is probably cell lines like HEK293 or primary neurons. The readout is qualitative (e.g., presence of aggregates) and quantitative (e.g., levels of Parkin). The study mentions using wild-type Parkin as a control, so positive and negative controls are present. 

For the readout description, the variant C289G leads to protein misfolding and aggregation, which is abnormal. The conclusion is abnormal, molecular effect is loss-of-function. The thresholds for normal and abnormal might not be explicitly stated, so I'll use custom sources. The approved assay would be for mitophagy studies, which are common in Parkinson's research. 

I need to structure all this into the JSON format as specified, making sure to include all the required fields. Check if there are any other variants mentioned. The abstract only mentions the C289G variant, so that's the only one. Ensure that the MONDO ID is correct. Also, verify that the experimental methods are properly described with their materials, controls, and statistical analysis. Since the abstract doesn't mention specific statistical methods, I'll note that as N.D. for statistical analysis.
