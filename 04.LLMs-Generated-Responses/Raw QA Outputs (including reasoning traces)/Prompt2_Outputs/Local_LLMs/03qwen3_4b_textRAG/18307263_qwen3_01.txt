Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a scientific abstract and wants me to extract information into a specific JSON format. First, I need to parse the abstract carefully.

The main focus is on PINK1 mutations in a sporadic patient with Parkinson's. The variants mentioned are p.A244G and p.V317I. I need to standardize their HGVS nomenclature. The original text says "compound heterozygous PINK1 mutations" with these two variants. 

Next, the disease is Parkinson's, but the abstract mentions that the patient's phenotype is similar to idiopathic PD. However, the study is about PINK1-related parkinsonism. So the MONDO term should be for PINK1-related parkinsonism. Looking up MONDO, the term for autosomal recessive parkinsonism (ARP) is MONDO:0012903, but the specific PINK1-related might be a subset. Wait, the abstract mentions that PINK1 is the second most frequent cause of ARP after Parkin. So the disease here is autosomal recessive parkinsonism, and the MONDO term for that is MONDO:0012903. But the patient's case is a sporadic case, but the study is about PINK1-related parkinsonism. Need to check if the MONDO term is correct.

For the experimental methods, the abstract states that the mutations "abolish the protective effect of wild-type PINK1 against staurosporine-induced apoptosis." So the experiment involves testing the effect of these mutations on apoptosis. The method here is likely a cell-based assay using staurosporine to induce apoptosis. The material used might be cell lines, like HEK293 or other cell lines. The readout is the effect on apoptosis, which is a qualitative or quantitative result. The study mentions that the mutations abolish the protective effect, so the conclusion would be abnormal. 

The abstract doesn't mention specific details about replicates, controls, or statistical methods. So for those fields, I'll put N.D. unless the literature explicitly states it. The "Approved assay" would be whether this method is commonly used for studying Parkinson's. Since the study is about PINK1 mutations and apoptosis, using staurosporine to test apoptosis is a standard method in neurodegenerative studies. So "Approved assay" would be Yes.

Now, structuring the JSON. The variants are PINK1 with the two mutations. The HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. The original is p.A244G and p.V317I. The transcript is probably NM_001251.4 (assuming the correct transcript for PINK1). The cDNA changes would be c.731G>A and c.950I>V. The protein changes are A244G and V317I. The description in the input context is "both mutations (p.A244G and p.V317I) were found to abolish the protective effect..." 

For the disease, the MONDO term is MONDO:0012903 for autosomal recessive parkinsonism. The experiment method is the apoptosis assay using staurosporine. The material used is likely cell lines, but the abstract doesn't specify, so Material Source is N.D. The readout type is qualitative, as it's about the effect on apoptosis. The readout description includes both variants, their conclusions, molecular effects, and result descriptions. Since the mutations abolish the protective effect, the conclusion is abnormal, molecular effect is loss-of-function. 

The rest of the experimental details like replicates, controls, etc., are not mentioned in the literature, so they are N.D. The approved assay is Yes because this method is commonly used in studying Parkinson's related to PINK1 mutations.
