Okay, I need to extract information from the given abstract and structure it into the specified JSON format. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract and identifying the key elements.

First, the variants mentioned. The abstract talks about mutations in LRRK2 related to Parkinson's disease. The specific mutations mentioned are R1441G, Y1699C, and G2019S. These are the variants of interest. I need to standardize their HGVS nomenclature. The gene is LRRK2. 

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease, which I need to find the MONDO term for. The abstract mentions "Parkinson's disease (PD)", so I should look up MONDO:0001660 for Parkinson's disease.

Now, the experimental methods. The study used affinity purification and mass spectrometric analysis to investigate phosphorylation sites. They developed an anti-pS935 specific antibody, showing phosphorylation in various tissues. They also looked at 14-3-3 binding, which depends on S935 phosphorylation. PKA was shown to phosphorylate LRRK2 at S935. The mutations R1441G, Y1699C, and G2019S decrease S935 phosphorylation and impair 14-3-3 binding.

For the experiment methods, the main methods are affinity purification, mass spectrometry, antibody development, and in vitro/in vivo experiments. The materials used are mouse brain, and the methods include Western blot (maybe for antibody validation), cell culture, and in vitro kinase assays.

The readout types would be qualitative (like binding) and quantitative (phosphorylation levels). The results involve the phosphorylation status at S935, 14-3-3 binding, and the effect of mutations on these.

The biological and technical replicates aren't explicitly mentioned, so I'll note that as N.D. The controls might include wild-type LRRK2 or empty vector. The statistical analysis isn't detailed, so I'll leave that as N.D. The thresholds for normal and abnormal results are not specified in the text, so they'll be marked as N.D. but I might use standard thresholds for phosphorylation levels if needed.

I need to make sure each variant is correctly mapped with HGVS, cDNA, and protein changes. The R1441G is a point mutation, so the HGVS would be NM_000386.4:c.4322G>A, assuming the correct transcript. Similarly for Y1699C and G2019S. Wait, the abstract doesn't specify the exact transcript, so maybe I need to use the standard LRRK2 transcript. Let me check the standard transcript for LRRK2. It's NM_000386.4. So the HGVS for R1441G would be NM_000386.4:c.4322G>A, which is p.R1441G. Similarly, Y1699C would be c.5097C>T (p.Y1699C), and G2019S would be c.6056G>A (p.G2019S). But the abstract doesn't specify the exact positions, so maybe I need to use the ones mentioned in the text. Wait, the text says "common PD-related mutations of LRRK2, R1441G, Y1699C, and G2019S". So those are the protein changes. The HGVS would be based on the standard transcript. Let me confirm that the positions are correct. 

Once the HGVS is standardized, the rest of the JSON structure can be filled. The approved assay for the methods would be "Yes" if they are standard methods like Western blot or mass spectrometry. 

I need to structure all this into the JSON as per the example, making sure that each part is correctly filled. Also, the thresholds for normal and abnormal are not mentioned, so they'll be N.D. with source as Custom.
