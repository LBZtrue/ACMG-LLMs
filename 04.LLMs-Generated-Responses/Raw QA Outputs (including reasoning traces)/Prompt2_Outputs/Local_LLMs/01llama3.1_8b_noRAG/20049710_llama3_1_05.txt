Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to extract and organize the data from the literature.

**Step 1: Extract variant information**

* Read the literature and identify the relevant sections related to variants.
* Extract the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant.
* Organize this information in a tabular format or as a list of objects.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature**

* Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl, UCSC Genome Browser) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants extracted in Step 1.
* Update the "HGVS" field in the variant object with the standardized nomenclature.

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

* Read the literature and identify the disease studied.
* Use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding MONDO term for the identified disease.
* Update the "Described Disease" section of the JSON framework with the disease name and MONDO term.

**Step 4: Extract experimental method information**

* Read the literature and identify all experimental methods mentioned.
* Extract detailed information about each method, including:
	+ Assay Method
	+ Material used (source, name, description)
	+ Readout type
	+ Result descriptions for each variant
	+ Biological replicates (yes/no/n.d.)
	+ Technical replicates (yes/no/n.d.)
	+ Basic positive control (yes/no/n.d.)
	+ Basic negative control (yes/no/n.d.)
	+ Validation controls P/LP (yes/no/n.d., counts)
	+ Validation controls B/LB (yes/no/n.d., counts)
	+ Statistical analysis method
	+ Threshold for normal readout (literature/custom)
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout (literature/custom)
	+ Approved assay (yes/no/n.d.)
* Organize this information in a tabular format or as a list of objects.

**Step 5: Organize extracted and standardized information**

* Use the predefined JSON framework to organize the extracted and standardized data.
* Populate the "Variants Include", "Described Disease", and "Experiment Method" sections with the relevant information.
* Ensure that all fields are properly formatted and populated according to the specification.

**Step 6: Review and validate output**

* Review the organized data for accuracy and completeness.
* Validate the output against the original literature to ensure that no information has been missed or incorrectly extracted.
* Make any necessary corrections or updates to the output.
