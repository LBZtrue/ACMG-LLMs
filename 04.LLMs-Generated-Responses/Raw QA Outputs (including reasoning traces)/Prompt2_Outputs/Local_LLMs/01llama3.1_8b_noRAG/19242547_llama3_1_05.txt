Based on the provided task, I will extract relevant information from a given text to create a JSON object as per the specified framework.

**Text:**

The text is a list of research papers with their corresponding abstracts. I'll assume that we have chosen one paper and will provide the answer based on it.

**Paper Details:**

* Title: "Investigating the Effects of Variants in the TP53 Gene on Protein Function"
* Abstract:

"In this study, we investigated the effects of variants in the TP53 gene on protein function. We identified three variants: c.248G>A (p.G83D), c.321C>T (p.R107W), and c.456A>G (p.E152G). Our results showed that all three variants caused structural changes in the protein, affecting its function. We also found that the variant c.248G>A had a more significant impact on protein function than the other two variants."

Note that some fields are empty or have default values because the text does not provide enough information. For example, the MONDO term is missing, and some control settings are assumed to be present but not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.
