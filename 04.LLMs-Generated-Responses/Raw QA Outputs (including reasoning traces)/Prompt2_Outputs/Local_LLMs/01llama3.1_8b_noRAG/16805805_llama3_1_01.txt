To solve this problem, we need to follow the workflow provided:

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.
5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here's an example of how we can implement this:

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Variant Information**

* Let's assume we have a text document containing the literature. We need to extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
* For example, let's say the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene: `c.248G>A (p.G83D)`.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

* We need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API. For example, we can use the Ensembl API to standardize the variant.
* Let's say the standardized HGVS nomenclature is `NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A`.

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* We need to identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
* For example, let's say the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term `MONDO:0012345`.

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

* We need to list all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
* For example, let's say the literature mentions a Western Blot experiment with the following details:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
	+ Readout type: Quantitative
	+ Result description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods are Generally Used**

* We need to determine whether the experimental methods mentioned in the literature are generally used for studying the disease.
* For example, let's say the Western Blot experiment is commonly used for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information into JSON Framework**

* Finally, we need to organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here is an example of what the final output might look like in JSON format:
