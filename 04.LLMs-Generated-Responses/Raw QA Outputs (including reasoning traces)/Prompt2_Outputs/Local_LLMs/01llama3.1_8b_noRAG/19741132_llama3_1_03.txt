Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to extract and standardize the information from the literature.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* For example, assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D).

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature of each variant. For example:
	+ Input: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Output: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>T (p.G83D)

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* Identify the disease studied in the literature, e.g., "Hereditary Myopathy."
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term for the disease from the MONDO database.

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each method, extract detailed information such as:
	+ Material source
	+ Material name
	+ Description of material
	+ Readout type (quantitative/qualitative)
	+ Result description for each variant mentioned in the literature or listed in "Variants Include"
	+ Biological replicates (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Technical replicates (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Basic positive control (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Basic negative control (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Validation controls P/LP (yes/no/N.D., counts)
	+ Validation controls B/LB (yes/no/N.D., counts)
	+ Statistical analysis method
	+ Threshold for normal readout (literature/custom)
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout (literature/custom)

**Step 5: Determine if Experimental Methods are Generally Used for Studying the Disease**

* Determine whether the experimental methods mentioned in the literature are generally used for studying the disease.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

* Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework provided in the specification.

Here is an example of what the output might look like:
```
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>T",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "T",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```
Note that this is just one example, and the actual output will depend on the specific information extracted from the literature.
