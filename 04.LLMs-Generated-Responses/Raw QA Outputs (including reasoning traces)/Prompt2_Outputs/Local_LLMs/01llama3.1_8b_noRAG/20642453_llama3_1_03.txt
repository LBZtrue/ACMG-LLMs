2. Other experimental methods are not mentioned in the literature.

**Control Settings and Validation**

* Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants: Yes (2 counts).
* Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants: Yes (1 count).

**Statistical Analysis and Thresholds**

* Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7. (obtained from literature)
* Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7. (obtained from literature)

**Approved Assay**
