Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will outline the steps to follow for extracting and organizing information from a given literature document into the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Variant Information**

* Identify relevant sections in the literature that discuss genetic variants.
* For each variant mentioned:
	+ Record the gene name
	+ Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (cDNA variation)
	+ cDNA change information (transcript, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position)
	+ Protein change information (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position)

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
* Record the standardized HGVS nomenclature in the "HGVS" field of the "Variants Include" section.

**Step 3: Identify Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* Determine the disease studied in the literature.
* Look up the corresponding MONDO term using the MONDO database.
* Record the disease name and corresponding MONDO term in the "Described Disease" section.

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature (e.g., Western Blot, PCR).
* For each method:
	+ Record the assay method name
	+ Material source (cell line, animal model, patient-derived material)
	+ Material name
	+ Description of the material used
	+ Readout type (qualitative or quantitative)

**Step 5: Extract Detailed Information for Each Experimental Method**

* For each experimental method:
	+ Record biological replicate information (yes/no/N.D.) and description
	+ Record technical replicate information (yes/no/N.D.) and description
	+ Basic positive control information (yes/no/N.D.) and description
	+ Basic negative control information (yes/no/N.D.) and description
	+ Validation control information for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (yes/no/N.D. and count)
	+ Validation control information for benign/likely benign variants (yes/no/N.D. and count)
	+ Statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol

**Step 6: Determine Whether Experimental Methods are Generally Used for Studying Disease**

* Based on the literature, determine whether the experimental methods used are generally accepted for studying the disease.
* Record "Yes/No/N.D." in the "Approved assay" field of each experimental method.

**Step 7: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

* Follow the predefined JSON framework to organize extracted and standardized information from Steps 1-6.
* Ensure that all fields are populated with relevant data, including:
	+ Variants Include section
	+ Described Disease section
	+ Experiment Method section for each experimental method mentioned in the literature
