Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Extract variant information**

From the literature, we can extract the following information:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA change: 
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature**

Using the relevant API, we can standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

From the literature, we can identify the disease as "Hereditary Myopathy." Using the MONDO database, we can retrieve the corresponding term:

* MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract experimental method information**

The literature mentions the following experimental methods:

* Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D):
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Specific description of experimental result: "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."

**Step 5: Determine approved assay**

Based on the literature, we can determine that the Western Blot method is generally used for studying Hereditary Myopathy:

* Approved assay: Yes

Here is the extracted and standardized information in the predefined JSON framework:
