Based on the provided instructions and examples, I will perform the following tasks:

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.
5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Please provide the literature that you would like me to work with, or describe it in sufficient detail so I can simulate the process.

I will then generate a response in the format specified in the examples provided, with all relevant variant information, disease description, experimental methods, and approval status.
