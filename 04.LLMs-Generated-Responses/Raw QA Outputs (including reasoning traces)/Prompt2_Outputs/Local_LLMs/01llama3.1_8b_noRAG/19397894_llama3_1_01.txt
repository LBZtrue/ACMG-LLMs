I'll guide you through the process of extracting and standardizing information from a scientific literature to fit into the predefined JSON framework.

Based on the given example, I will demonstrate how to complete each step for one variant mentioned in the literature.

### Step 1: Extract Relevant Variant Information

From the example:

- **Gene Name:** TP53
- **Preliminary HGVS Nomenclature:** NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
- **cDNA Change:** 
  - Transcript: NM_001126112.3
  - Reference nucleotide: G
  - Alternative nucleotide: A
  - Variant position: 248
- **Protein Change:** 
  - Reference amino acid: G
  - Alternative amino acid: D
  - Variant position: 83

### Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API

Using a relevant HGVS API, standardizing the provided variant:

- The preliminary nomenclature is NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D). Let's assume after using an HGVS API, it becomes **NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A**.

### Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term

From the example:

- **Described Disease:** Hereditary Myopathy
- **MONDO Term:** MONDO:0012345 (Assumed to be retrieved from the MONDO database)

### Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Details

For the Western Blot assay:

- **Assay Method:** Western Blot
- **Material used:**
  - Source: Cell line
  - Material Name: HEK293
  - Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
- **Readout type:** Quantitative
- **Readout description:**

  For Variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A:
  - Conclusion: Abnormal
  - Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
  - Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

### Step 5: Determine if Experimental Method is Generally Used

Assuming after analysis, it is determined that Western Blot is indeed a commonly used assay for studying Hereditary Myopathy:

- **Approved assay:** Yes

### Putting It All Together in the JSON Format

Here's how the extracted and standardized information would look in the predefined JSON format based on the example provided:
