Based on the provided specifications, I will guide you through the process of extracting and standardizing information from a given literature.

**Step 1:** Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

From the example provided, we can see that the variant is in the TP53 gene with the preliminary HGVS nomenclature being "c.248G>A (p.G83D)". The literature also describes the variant as causing a structural change in the protein, affecting its function.

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

Using an HGVS nomenclature standardization tool or API, we can convert the preliminary HGVS nomenclature to the standardized format. For this example, let's assume the standardized HGVS is "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A".

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

From the example provided, we can see that the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term being "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

From the example provided, we can see that the experimental method is Western Blot. The details are as follows:

* Material used: HEK293 cell line
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP: Yes, 2 validation controls were included.
* Validation controls B/LB: Yes, 1 validation control was included.
* Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 (Source: Literature)
* Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7 (Source: Literature)

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.

Based on the example provided, it appears that Western Blot is a commonly used method for studying Hereditary Myopathy. Therefore, we can conclude that the experimental protocol used in this literature is generally approved for studying this disease.

**Step 6:** Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here is an example of how the organized data would look like in JSON format:
