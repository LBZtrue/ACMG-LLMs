Based on the provided specification, I will attempt to answer this question by following the workflow and extracting relevant information from the literature.

However, since there is no specific literature provided in the question, I'll use a hypothetical example to demonstrate the extraction process. Let's assume we're working with the literature that mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

Here's the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
