Based on the provided workflow and JSON framework, I will extract the relevant information from the literature and organize it according to the predefined structure.

**Step 1-2: Extract variant information and standardize HGVS nomenclature**

The literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The standardized HGVS nomenclature for this variant is NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

The disease studied in the literature is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 4-5: Extract experimental method information**

The literature mentions the following experimental methods:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description: The variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A had an abnormal conclusion, with a molecular effect of partial loss-of-function.

**Step 6: Organize extracted information into JSON framework**

Here is the organized JSON structure:
