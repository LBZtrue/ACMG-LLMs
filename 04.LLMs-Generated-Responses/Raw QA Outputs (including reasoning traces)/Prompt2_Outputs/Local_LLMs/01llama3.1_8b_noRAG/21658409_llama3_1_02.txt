Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to follow in order to complete the task:

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes mentioned in the literature for each variant.
* Store this information in a temporary storage location.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use an API (e.g., Ensembl) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants extracted in Step 1.
* Replace the preliminary HGVS nomenclature with the standardized one in the temporary storage location.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Identify the disease name mentioned in the literature as the "Described Disease".
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term for the disease using the MONDO database.
* Store the disease name and MONDO term in the temporary storage location.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Identify the experimental methods (e.g., Western Blot) used in the study.
* Extract detailed information about each method, including:
	+ Material source
	+ Material name
	+ Description of material
	+ Readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
	+ Result description for each variant
	+ Experimental replicates (biological and technical)
	+ Control settings (positive and negative controls)
	+ Validation controls (pathogenic/likely pathogenic and benign/likely benign)
	+ Statistical analysis method
	+ Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts
* Store this information in the temporary storage location.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Research and determine whether the experimental protocol used is generally accepted for studying the disease.
* Store this information as "Approved assay" in the temporary storage location.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Use the temporary storage location to fill out the predefined JSON framework with the extracted and standardized information.
* Ensure that all fields are correctly filled and formatted according to the specification.

The final output will be a JSON object containing the extracted and standardized variant information, disease name, MONDO term, and experimental method details.
