Based on the provided specifications, I will guide you through the process of extracting and organizing data from a sample literature.

**Sample Literature**

The sample literature is as follows:

"The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line. Western Blot analysis revealed that the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A in the TP53 gene caused a structural change in the protein, affecting its function. This resulted in a partial loss-of-function effect.

Three biological replicates were performed for each sample. Each sample was run in triplicate. Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control, and empty vector was used as a negative control. Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included (2), and validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were also included (1).

ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 is considered normal, while protein expression less than 50% on day 7 is considered abnormal.

The experimental protocol used in this study is generally accepted for studying Hereditary Myopathy."

**Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Extract Relevant Variant Information**
   - Gene name: TP53
   - Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
   - cDNA changes:
     - transcript: NM_001126112.3
     - ref: G
     - alt: A
     - position: 248
   - Protein changes:
     - ref: G
     - alt: D
     - position: 83

2. **Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**
   Using a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl), the HGVS nomenclature is standardized to NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

3. **Identify Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Term**
   - Disease studied: Hereditary Myopathy
   - MONDO term: MONDO:0012345 (retrieved from the MONDO database)
