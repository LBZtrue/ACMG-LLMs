Based on the provided specifications, I will guide you through the process of extracting and organizing the information from the literature into a JSON format.

**Step 1: Extracting Relevant Variant Information**

From the literature, extract the following information for each variant:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

**Step 2: Standardizing HGVS Nomenclature**

Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

**Step 3: Identifying Disease and Retrieving MONDO Term**

Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term number from the MONDO database.

**Step 4: Extracting Experimental Method Information**

For each experimental method mentioned in the literature, extract the following information:

* Assay method (name of the experimental method)
* Material used:
	+ Material source (e.g., cell line, animal model, patients-derived material)
	+ Material name
	+ Description of the material
* Readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
* Readout description: This should contain all the variants mentioned in the 'Variants Include' section
* Biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Description of biological replicates
* Technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Description of technical replicates
* Basic positive control:
	+ Whether a basic positive control was set up (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Description of the positive control
* Basic negative control:
	+ Whether a basic negative control was set up (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Description of the negative control
* Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants:
	+ Whether validation controls were included (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Number of validation controls
* Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants:
	+ Whether validation controls were included (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Number of validation controls
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Description of the statistical analysis method used
* Thresholds for normal and abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal results
	+ Source of the threshold (literature/custom)
	+ Threshold for abnormal results
	+ Source of the threshold (literature/custom)
* Approved assay:
	+ Whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease (yes/no/N.D.)

**Step 5: Organizing Information into JSON Format**

Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here's an example of what the final JSON output might look like:

This is a detailed guide to extracting and organizing the information from the literature into a JSON format. Please note that this example is based on a single experimental method, but in practice, you may need to handle multiple methods and their respective information.
