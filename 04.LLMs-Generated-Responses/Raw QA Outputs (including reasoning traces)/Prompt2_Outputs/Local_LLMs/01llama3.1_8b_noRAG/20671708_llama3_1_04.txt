To solve this problem, we need to follow the workflow and extract information from the given text. The task is to organize the extracted information into a predefined JSON framework.

Here's the solution:

**Step 1:** Extract relevant variant information from the literature.

*   Gene: TP53
*   Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
*   cDNA Change:
    *   Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
    *   Reference nucleotide: G
    *   Alternative nucleotide: A
    *   Variant position: 248
*   Protein Change:
    *   Reference amino acid: G
    *   Alternative amino acid: D
    *   Variant position: 83

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

Using an HGVS API, we can standardize the variant as follows:

*   NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

The experimental method is Western Blot.

*   Material used:
    *   Source: Cell line
    *   Name: HEK293
    *   Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
*   Readout type: Quantitative
*   Result description for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D):
    +   Conclusion: Abnormal
    +   Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
    +   Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
*   Biological replicates: Yes, with three biological replicates performed.
*   Technical replicates: Yes, with each sample run in triplicate.
*   Basic positive control: Yes, using wild-type cDNA as a positive control.
*   Basic negative control: Yes, using empty vector as a negative control.
*   Validation controls P/LP: Yes, with 2 validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants.
*   Validation controls B/LB: Yes, with 1 validation control for benign/likely benign variants.
*   Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
*   Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 (source: Literature).
*   Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7 (source: Literature).

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease.

Yes, Western Blot is an approved assay for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

Here's the final JSON output:
