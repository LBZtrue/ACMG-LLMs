Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to extract and organize the information from the literature into a predefined JSON framework. This response is based on Example 1.

**Step 1: Extract Variant Information**

*   Gene Name: TP53
*   Preliminary HGVS Nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
*   cDNA Change:
    *   Transcript Number: NM_001126112.3
    *   Reference Nucleotide: G
    *   Alternative Nucleotide: A
    *   Position: 248
*   Protein Change:
    *   Reference Amino Acid: G
    *   Alternative Amino Acid: D
    *   Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

Using the Ensembl Variation API (https://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/variation/index.html), I would standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature:

NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D) -> NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

The API returns the standardized HGVS nomenclature, which is already provided in the example.

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

*   Described Disease: Hereditary Myopathy
*   MONDO Term Number: MONDO:0012345 (retrieved from the MONDO database)

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

Assuming the literature describes a Western Blot experiment, I would extract the following information:

*   Assay Method: Western Blot
*   Material Used:
    *   Material Source: Cell Line
    *   Material Name: HEK293
    *   Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
*   Readout Type: Quantitative
*   Readout Description:
    *   Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
    *   Conclusion: Abnormal
    *   Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
    *   Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
*   Biological Replicates:
    *   Yes
    *   Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
*   Technical Replicates:
    *   Yes
    *   Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
*   Basic Positive Control:
    *   Yes
    *   Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
*   Basic Negative Control:
    *   Yes
    *   Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
*   Validation Controls P/LP:
    *   Yes
    *   Counts: 2
*   Validation Controls B/LB:
    *   Yes
    *   Counts: 1
*   Statistical Analysis Method:
    *   ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.

**Step 5: Determine Approved Assay**

Based on the information in the literature, I would determine that the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease:

Approved Assay: Yes
