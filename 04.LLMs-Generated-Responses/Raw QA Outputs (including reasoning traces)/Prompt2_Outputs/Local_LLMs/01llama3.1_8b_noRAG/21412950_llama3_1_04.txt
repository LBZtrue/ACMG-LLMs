I will guide you through the process of extracting and organizing information from a scientific literature review according to the provided JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

Assuming the given example, we start by reading the literature. The variant mentioned in the text is `c.248G>A (p.G83D)` in the TP53 gene. We extract this information and note down the preliminary HGVS nomenclature.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

We standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature using a relevant API, for example, Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) or HGVS' own API. For our variant `c.248G>A` in gene TP53, we get:

* **Standardized HGVS:** NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* cDNA Change: 
  * Transcript: NM_001126112.3
  * Reference nucleotide (ref): G
  * Alternative nucleotide (alt): A
  * Position: 248
* Protein Change:
  * Reference amino acid (ref): G
  * Alternative amino acid (alt): D
  * Position: 83

We record these standardized values.

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Term**

The disease studied in this example is "Hereditary Myopathy". We look up the corresponding MONDO term, which we find to be "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Details**

From the literature, we extract details of an experimental method called "Western Blot". The material used was a cell line named HEK293.

**Step 5: Organize Information According to JSON Framework**

Using the extracted and standardized information, we organize it according to the provided JSON framework. Here is how our example would be organized:

```json

    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [

                    "cDNA Change": {

                        "ref": "G",

                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            "Readout type": "Quantitative",
            "Readout description": [
                {
                    "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
                    "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
                    "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
                }
            ],
            // ... 
        }
    ]
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual literature reviews may have more complex information to extract and organize.

**Step 6: Finalize**

We review our JSON output for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the provided framework.
