Based on the provided specifications, I will outline the steps to complete the task:

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Identify the gene(s) mentioned in the literature
* Extract preliminary HGVS nomenclature for each variant
* Record cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position)
* Record protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position)

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use a reliable API (e.g., Ensembl) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant
* Update the extracted information with the standardized HGVS nomenclature

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Extract the name of the disease studied in the literature
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term number from the MONDO database

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Identify the type of experimental method used (e.g., Western Blot, qRT-PCR)
* Extract material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Review scientific literature to determine if the experimental method is commonly used for studying the disease
* Record "Yes" or "No" in the "Approved assay" field based on this review

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Use the provided JSON framework as a template to organize the extracted information
* Ensure that all required fields are filled with accurate and relevant data

The resulting JSON output will contain the following structure:
