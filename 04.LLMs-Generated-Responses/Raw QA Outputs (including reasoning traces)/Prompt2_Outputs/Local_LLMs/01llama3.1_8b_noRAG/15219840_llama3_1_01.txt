To answer this question, we will need to break down the task into smaller steps and provide a detailed response.

**Step 1:** Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

For example, let's assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

We can use the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. The VEP API takes a variant as input and returns the standardized HGVS nomenclature, along with other information such as the cDNA change and protein change.

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

For example, let's assume the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy." We can use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding term, which would be "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

For example, let's assume the literature mentions a Western Blot experiment. We can extract the following information:

* Material source: Cell line
* Material name: HEK293
* Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP: Yes, two validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included.
* Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.

For example, let's assume that Western Blot is a commonly used method for studying Hereditary Myopathy. We can conclude that the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease.

**Step 6:** Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

The final answer would be:
