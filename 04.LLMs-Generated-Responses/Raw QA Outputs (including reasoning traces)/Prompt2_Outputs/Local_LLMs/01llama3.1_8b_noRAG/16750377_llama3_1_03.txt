Based on the provided workflow and JSON framework, I'll outline the steps to follow:

**Step 1:** Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information.

* Extract gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Example: Variant TP53, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

* Use an API like Ensembl or NCBI's dbSNP to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
* Example: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

* Extract the disease name mentioned in the literature (e.g., Hereditary Myopathy).
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term number for the disease (e.g., MONDO:0012345).

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.

* Extract assay method, material source, readout type, result descriptions, biological replicates, technical replicates, positive control, negative control, statistical analysis method, threshold for normal readout, and threshold for abnormal readout for each experiment.
* Example: Western Blot with HEK293 cell line, quantitative readout, etc.

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.

* Assess if the experimental protocol used in the literature is commonly applied to study the specific disease mentioned (e.g., Hereditary Myopathy).

**Step 6:** Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

* Format the data into the JSON structure provided, incorporating the standardized HGVS nomenclature, MONDO term number, experimental method details, and other relevant information.
* Example:
