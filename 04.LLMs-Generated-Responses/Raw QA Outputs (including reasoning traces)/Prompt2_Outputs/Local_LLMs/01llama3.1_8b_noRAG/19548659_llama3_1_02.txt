Based on the provided specification, I will perform the following tasks:

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via a relevant API.
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.

Here is the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
