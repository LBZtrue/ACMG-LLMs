Based on the provided instructions and example, I will demonstrate how to extract relevant information from a literature article and organize it into the specified JSON framework.

**Example Literature Article**

The article discusses a study on a variant in the TP53 gene (c.248G>A, p.G83D) associated with Hereditary Myopathy. The authors performed Western Blot experiments using HEK293 cells to investigate the functional effects of this variant.

**Step 1: Extract Relevant Variant Information**

From the literature article:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Using a relevant API, standardize the HGVS nomenclature for the variant:

NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A -> NM_001126112.4:c.248G>A (Note: The version number has been updated to reflect the standardized format.)

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

From the literature article, identify the disease studied as Hereditary Myopathy. Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term:

MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

From the literature article, extract detailed information about the experimental method used (Western Blot):

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description: [Insert description of experimental result for this variant]

**Step 5: Organize Extracted Information into JSON Framework**

Using the extracted information, organize it into the specified JSON framework:
