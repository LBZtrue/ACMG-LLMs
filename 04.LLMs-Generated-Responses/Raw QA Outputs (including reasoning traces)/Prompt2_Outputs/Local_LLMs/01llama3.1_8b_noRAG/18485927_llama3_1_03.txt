To answer this question accurately, I will follow the workflow provided in the task description.

**Step 1:** Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information.

The given text appears to be a series of research papers or articles discussing various genetic variants and their effects on protein function. However, without access to specific texts or papers, I'll provide a general approach to extracting relevant information.

Extracted information would typically include:

* Gene names associated with the variants (e.g., TP53)
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature for each variant
* cDNA changes (transcript numbers, reference nucleotides, alternative nucleotides, and positions)
* Protein changes (reference amino acids, alternative amino acids, and positions)

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

For this step, we would use an HGVS API to standardize the variant nomenclatures. This process typically involves:

1. Inputting the preliminary HGVS nomenclature into the API.
2. The API then returns standardized HGVS nomenclature for each variant, including protein changes and amino acid positions.

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

This step involves identifying the specific disease mentioned in the research papers or articles and retrieving its corresponding MONDO term. The MONDO term would be used to standardize the disease name.

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.

Information for this step might include:

* Assay methods (e.g., Western Blot)
* Material sources
* Readout types (qualitative or quantitative)
* Result descriptions, including conclusions on molecular effects and whether variants show abnormal or normal protein expression

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease.

This step would involve researching standard practices in the field and verifying if the described experimental methods are indeed commonly used to study the disease mentioned.
