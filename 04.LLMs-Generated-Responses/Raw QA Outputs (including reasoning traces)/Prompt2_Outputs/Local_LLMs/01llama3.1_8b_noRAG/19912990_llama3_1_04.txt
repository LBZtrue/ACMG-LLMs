Based on the provided specification, I will provide a step-by-step solution to extract and organize the relevant information from the literature into the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Extract gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* For example, assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D).

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use an API such as Ensembl Variation or UCSC Table Browser to standardize the HGVS nomenclature.
* For example, assume the standardized HGVS nomenclature for the variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) is NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Extract the disease name mentioned in the literature.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term for the disease using the MONDO database.
* For example, assume the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Extract material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results for each experimental method.
* For example, assume the experimental method is Western Blot.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Based on external knowledge or literature search, determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Use the extracted information from steps 1-5 to populate the corresponding fields in the predefined JSON framework.
* The resulting JSON output should match the provided example:
