To answer the question, I will follow the workflow and provide the final JSON output based on the given literature. However, since the specific literature is not provided in the question, I will create a hypothetical example to illustrate how the process works.

Let's assume we have a piece of literature that discusses a study on "Hereditary Myopathy" involving the TP53 gene. The study uses Western Blot as an experimental method and examines the effect of a variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) in the TP53 gene.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1.  **Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information:**

    *   Gene name: TP53
    *   Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
    *   cDNA changes:
        *   Transcript: NM\_001126112.3
        *   Reference nucleotide: G
        *   Alternative nucleotide: A
        *   Variant position: 248
    *   Protein changes:
        *   Reference amino acid: G
        *   Alternative amino acid: D
        *   Variant position: 83

2.  **Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API:**

    *   The standardized HGVS nomenclature for the variant is NM\_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

3.  **Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database:**

    *   Disease name: Hereditary Myopathy
    *   MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

4.  **List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method:**

    *   Assay Method: Western Blot
    *   Material used:
        *   Source of material: Cell line
        *   Material name: HEK293
        *   Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
    *   Readout type: Quantitative
    *   Readout description:
        *   Variant: NM\_001126112.3:c.248G>A
        *   Conclusion: Abnormal
        *   Molecular effect: partial loss-of-function
        *   Result description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM\_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

5.  **Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease:**

    *   Approved assay: Yes
