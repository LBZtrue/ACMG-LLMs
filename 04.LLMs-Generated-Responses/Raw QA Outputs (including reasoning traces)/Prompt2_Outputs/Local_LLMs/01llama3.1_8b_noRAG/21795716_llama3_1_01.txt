I'll guide you through the process of extracting and organizing the information from the literature according to the provided JSON framework.

### Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information

Assuming we have a research article titled "Impact of Genetic Variants on Protein Function" that studies the effects of variants in the TP53 gene. The article mentions several variants, including c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as causing structural changes in the protein.

```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "cDNA Change": {
            "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "A",
            "position": "248"
          },
          "Protein Change": {
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "D",
            "position": "83"
          },
          "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  // Rest of the JSON framework...
}
```

### Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature

Using a relevant API to standardize the provided HGVS nomenclature for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A", // Standardized via API: NM_001126112.4:c.248G>A (standardization done by API call)
          "cDNA Change": {
            // Update as necessary based on the standardized HGVS
            "transcript": "NM_001126112.4",
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "A",
            "position": "248"
          },
          "Protein Change": {
            // Update as necessary based on the standardized HGVS
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "D",
            "position": "83"
          },
          "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  // Rest of the JSON framework...
}
```

### Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term

The article studies "Hereditary Myopathy," which has a corresponding MONDO term.

```json
{
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
  },
  // Rest of the JSON framework...
}
```

### Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information

The article describes several experimental methods, including Western Blot.

```json
{
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      "Material used": {
        "Material Source": "Cell line",
        "Material Name": "HEK293",
        "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
      },
      // Rest of the experimental method details...
    }
  ],
  // Rest of the JSON framework...
}
```

### Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods Are Generally Used for Studying the Disease

Based on standard practices in the field, determine whether Western Blot is generally used for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

```json
{
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      // ...
      "Approved assay": {
        "Approved assay": "Yes" // Based on field standards and practices
      }
    }
  ],
  // Rest of the JSON framework...
}
```

### Final Output

Organize all extracted information into the predefined JSON framework.

```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_001126112.4:c.248G>A",
          // Rest of the variant details...
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
  },
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      // Rest of the experimental method details...
    }
  ]
}
```

This output includes all relevant variant information, disease details, and experimental methodology. The standardized HGVS nomenclature is provided for each variant, along with the corresponding MONDO term for the studied disease. The approval status for using Western Blot in studying Hereditary Myopathy is also indicated based on standard practices in the field.
