Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting relevant information from a literature article related to genetic variants. We will use a sample article as an example.

**Step 1: Extract Relevant Information**

Assume we have the following literature article:

Title: "The impact of genetic variants on protein function in hereditary myopathy."

In this article, we find a mention of a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), which affects the structure and function of the protein.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Using a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl or NCBI), we standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature:

* Gene: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* Standardized HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (already standardized)

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

The disease studied in the article is "Hereditary Myopathy." We retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the database:

* Disease name: Hereditary Myopathy
* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

The article mentions two experimental methods: Western Blot and RT-PCR. We extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

For the Western Blot experiment:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: "Three biological replicates were performed."
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: Yes
	+ Description: "Each sample was run in triplicate."

For the RT-PCR experiment:

* Assay Method: RT-PCR
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: "RNA expression was reduced by 30% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: "Three biological replicates were performed."
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: Yes
	+ Description: "Each sample was run in triplicate."

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods are Generally Used for Studying the Disease**

We determine that both Western Blot and RT-PCR are commonly used experimental methods for studying hereditary myopathy.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted Information into JSON Format**

Finally, we organize the extracted information according to the predefined JSON framework:
