Based on the provided literature and the predefined JSON framework, I will extract and standardize the information according to the workflow.

**Step 1: Extract relevant variant information**

From the literature, I extracted a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API**

Using the provided API, I standardized the HGVS nomenclature of the variant:

* Preliminary HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* Standardized HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (no change needed)

**Step 3: Identify disease studied and retrieve MONDO term**

From the literature, I identified the disease as "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: Extract experimental method details**

The literature mentions a Western Blot assay as the experimental method. I extracted the following information:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A:
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 5: Extract experimental replicates and control settings**

From the literature, I extracted the following information:

* Biological replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Yes
	+ Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Yes
	+ Empty vector was used as a negative control.

**Step 6: Determine approved assay**

From the literature, I determined that the Western Blot assay is generally used for studying Hereditary Myopathy:

* Approved assay: Yes

Here is the extracted and standardized information in the predefined JSON framework:

Note that the `Variants Include` section only contains one variant, and the `Readout description` section only contains information for this single variant. If there are multiple variants, you will need to add additional objects to these sections.
