Based on the provided literature and the predefined JSON framework, I will extract and standardize the information as follows:

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information:
   - Gene name: TP53
   - Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
   - cDNA changes:
     * Transcript: NM_001126112.3
     * Reference nucleotide: G
     * Alternative nucleotide: A
     * Position: 248
   - Protein changes:
     * Reference amino acid: G
     * Alternative amino acid: D
     * Position: 83

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
   The standardized HGVS nomenclature is already provided in the literature as NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database:
   - Disease name: Hereditary Myopathy
   - Corresponding MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
   - Assay Method: Western Blot
   - Material used:
     * Source: Cell line
     * Name: HEK293
     * Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
   - Readout type: Quantitative
   - Result description for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A:
     * Conclusion: Abnormal
     * Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
     * Specific description of the experimental result: "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
   - Biological replicates:
     * Yes
     * Description: "Three biological replicates were performed."
   - Technical replicates:
     * Yes
     * Description: "Each sample was run in triplicate."
   - Basic positive control:
     * Yes
     * Description: "Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control."
   - Basic negative control:
     * Yes
     * Description: "Empty vector was used as a negative control."
   - Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants:
     * Yes
     * Counts: 2
   - Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants:
     * Yes
     * Counts: 1
   - Statistical analysis method:
     * ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
   - Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts:
     * Normal: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7. (Source: Literature)
     * Abnormal: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7. (Source: Literature)

5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
   - Yes

The final JSON output is:
