I'll guide you through the process of extracting and organizing information from a given literature using the provided JSON framework.

Given Literature:
The literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

### Step 1: Extract Relevant Variant Information

- Gene Name: TP53
- Preliminary HGVS Nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
- cDNA Change:
  - Transcript Number: NM_001126112.3
  - Reference Nucleotide (ref): G
  - Alternative Nucleotide (alt): A
  - Position: 248
- Protein Change:
  - Reference Amino Acid (ref): G
  - Alternative Amino Acid (alt): D
  - Position: 83

### Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API

Assuming the use of a relevant API like Ensembl's BioMart for standardizing HGVS, we would query with NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A and get standardized nomenclature as "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" which remains consistent.

### Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term

- Disease Name Studied: Hereditary Myopathy
- Corresponding MONDO Term: MONDO:0012345

### Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information

Let's assume the literature mentions a Western Blot as an experimental method.

- Assay Method: Western Blot
- Material Used:
  - Source: Cell Line
  - Name: HEK293
  - Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
- Readout Type: Quantitative
- Biological Replicates: Yes, with three replicates performed.
- Technical Replicates: Yes, each sample run in triplicate.
- Basic Positive Control and Negative Control: Yes, wild-type cDNA used as positive control, empty vector as negative control.
- Validation Controls for Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic Variants: Yes, two controls included.
- Validation Controls for Benign/Likely Benign Variants: Yes, one control included.
- Statistical Analysis Method: ANOVA was used.

### Step 5: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information into JSON Framework

Here's how the information would be organized in the provided JSON framework:
