Based on the provided specifications, I will guide you through the process of extracting and organizing information from a given literature example.

**Step 1: Extract relevant variant information**

From the literature, extract the following details for the TP53 gene:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API**

Using a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl's REST API), standardize the HGVS nomenclature for the TP53 gene:

* Input: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* Output: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (standardized)

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied and retrieve MONDO term**

From the literature, identify the disease studied as "Hereditary Myopathy." Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term:

* Disease name: Hereditary Myopathy
* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract experimental method details**

From the literature, extract the following information for the Western Blot experiment:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* Experimental replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
	+ Technical replicates: Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease**

Based on the literature, determine that the Western Blot experiment is generally used for studying Hereditary Myopathy:

* Approved assay: Yes

Now, let's organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
