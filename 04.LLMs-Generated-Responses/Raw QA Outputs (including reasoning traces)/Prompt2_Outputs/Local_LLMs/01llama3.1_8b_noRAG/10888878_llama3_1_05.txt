To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the workflow. Here is a detailed explanation of how to solve it:

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

The literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D). We can extract this information as follows:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

We can use an API such as Ensembl to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. The standardized HGVS nomenclature for this variant is:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The disease studied in the literature is "Hereditary Myopathy". We can retrieve the corresponding MONDO term as follows:

* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

The literature mentions a Western Blot experiment. We can extract the following information:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Whether a basic positive control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Whether a basic negative control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Whether validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included: Yes
	+ Counts: 2
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Whether validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were included: Yes
	+ Counts: 1
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Description of the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal results in the literature: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal results in the literature: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Approved assay:
	+ Whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease: Yes

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

The experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Here is the final JSON output:
