To solve this problem, I'll break it down into steps according to the provided workflow.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

The literature provided contains a list of variants with their corresponding HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. The task is to extract this information for each variant.

Here's an example of how the extracted data might look like:

```
{
  "Variants": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A",
        "position": "248"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "D",
        "position": "83"
      }
    },
    {
      "Gene": "BRCA1",
      "HGVS": "NM_007294.3:c.1234C>T",
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "NM_007294.3",
        "ref": "C",
        "alt": "T",
        "position": "1234"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "H",
        "alt": "Y",
        "position": "412"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

To standardize the HGVS nomenclature, you would need to use an API that provides HGVS normalization services. This step would involve making API calls for each variant's HGVS nomenclature.

For example:

```
{
  "Variants": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
      "Standardized HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G"
    },
    {
      "Gene": "BRCA1",
      "HGVS": "NM_007294.3:c.1234C>T",
      "Standardized HGVS": "NM_007294.3:c.1234T>C"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The task is to identify the disease mentioned in the literature and retrieve its corresponding MONDO term.

For example:

```
{
  "Described Disease": {
    "Disease Name": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO Term": "MONDO:0012345"
  }
}
```

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

The task is to list all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract their corresponding details, such as material used, readout type, result descriptions, etc.

For example:

```
{
  "Experiment Methods": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      "Material Used": {
        "Source": "Cell line",
        "Name": "HEK293"
      },
      "Readout Type": "Quantitative",
      "Result Description": [
        {
          "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G",
          "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
          "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Assay Method": "Sanger Sequencing",
      "Material Used": {
        "Source": "Cell line",
        "Name": "HEK293"
      },
      "Readout Type": "Qualitative",
      "Result Description": [
        {
          "Variant": "NM_007294.3:c.1234T>C",
          "Conclusion": "Normal",
          "Molecular Effect": "No effect"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease**

The task is to determine whether each experimental method mentioned in the literature is generally used for studying the described disease.

For example:

```
{
  "Experiment Methods": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      "Used for Disease": "Yes"
    },
    {
      "Assay Method": "Sanger Sequencing",
      "Used for Disease": "No"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

The final task is to organize the extracted and standardized data into a single JSON object that follows the predefined structure.

Here's an example of the complete output:

```
{
  "Variants": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G",
      "Standardized HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A",
        "position": "248"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "D",
        "position": "83"
      }
    },
    {
      "Gene": "BRCA1",
      "HGVS": "NM_007294.3:c.1234T>C",
      "Standardized HGVS": "NM_007294.3:c.1234C>T",
