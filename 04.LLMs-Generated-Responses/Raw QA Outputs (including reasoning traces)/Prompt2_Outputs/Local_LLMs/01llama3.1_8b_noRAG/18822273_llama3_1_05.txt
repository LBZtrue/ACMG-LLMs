To solve this problem, I will follow the provided workflow to extract and organize the required information from the literature according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1:** Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

From the given text, I can identify a few variants mentioned in the literature:

* The figure shows an immunoblot of HEK293 cells transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP (control) or pCMV6-Ac-GFP with the AC cassette. Bands corresponding to 55 kDa and 27 kDa are observed.
* A Western blot analysis was performed using anti-GFP antibodies, showing that both pCMV6-AC-GFP and pCMV6-AC-GFP with the AC cassette expressed GFP at high levels.

From this information, I can extract the following variant information:

* Gene: Unknown (since no specific gene name is mentioned)
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: N/A
* cDNA change:
	+ Position: 55 kDa and 27 kDa bands are observed in the Western blot analysis.
	+ Ref/Alt: Not specified.
* Protein change:
	+ Not applicable (since no protein changes are explicitly mentioned).

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

Since no specific variant has a preliminary HGVS nomenclature, I will skip this step for now.

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

From the text, it appears that the disease is related to the function of GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein). However, no specific disease name is mentioned. Therefore, I will not be able to provide a specific MONDO term number.

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.

From the text, I can identify two experimental methods:

* Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibodies.
* Immunoblot analysis of HEK293 cells transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP or pCMV6-AC-GFP with the AC cassette.

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease.

Since no specific disease name is mentioned, I will assume that these experimental methods may be relevant to various diseases related to GFP function.

**Step 6:** Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here is the resulting JSON output:
