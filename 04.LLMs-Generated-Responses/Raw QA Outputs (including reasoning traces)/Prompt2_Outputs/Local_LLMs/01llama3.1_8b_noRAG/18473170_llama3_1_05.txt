Based on the provided specifications, I will outline a step-by-step solution to extract and organize the relevant information from the literature.

**Step 1: Read the Literature**

Read the entire article carefully to understand the content, including experimental methods, results, and discussions. Take note of any specific details mentioned in the text that may be used later in the process.

**Step 2: Extract Relevant Variant Information**

Using the provided template, extract all relevant variant information from the literature, including:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

**Step 3: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants extracted in Step 2. Replace the preliminary HGVS nomenclature with the standardized version.

**Step 4: Identify Disease Studied**

Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

**Step 5: Extract Experimental Method Information**

List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature, including:

* Assay method (name)
* Material used (source, name, and description)
* Readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
* Result descriptions for each variant
* Biological replicates (number of replicates and description)
* Technical replicates (number of replicates and description)
* Basic positive control (description)
* Basic negative control (description)
* Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (number of controls and description)
* Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants (number of controls and description)
* Statistical analysis method
* Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts (values and sources)

**Step 6: Organize Information in Predefined JSON Framework**

Using the predefined JSON framework, organize the extracted and standardized information according to the following structure:

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            "Readout type": "Quantitative",
            "Readout description": [
                {
                    "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
                    "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
                    "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
                }
            ],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```
