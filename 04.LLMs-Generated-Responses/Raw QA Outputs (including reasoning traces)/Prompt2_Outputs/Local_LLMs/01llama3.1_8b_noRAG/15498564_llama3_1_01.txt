Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will demonstrate how to extract and organize information from a scientific article according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Literature Selection**

For this example, let's assume we have selected a scientific article titled "Functional Analysis of Variants in TP53 Gene" published in the journal Nature Communications. The abstract is as follows:

"In this study, we functionally analyzed variants in the TP53 gene using Western Blot. We used HEK293 cell line and found that variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) caused a partial loss-of-function effect on protein expression."

**Step 1: Extract Relevant Variant Information**

From the abstract, we can extract the following information:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Using the relevant API, we can standardize the HGVS nomenclature as follows:

NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D) → NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G (p.D83G)

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

From the abstract, we can identify that the disease studied is Hereditary Myopathy. We can retrieve the corresponding MONDO term as follows:

MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

From the abstract, we can extract the following information about the experimental method:

* Assay method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative

**Step 5: Extract Result Information**

From the abstract, we can extract the following information about the result:

* Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G (p.D83G)
* Conclusion: Abnormal
* Molecular effect: partial loss-of-function
* Result description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G (p.D83G).

**Step 6: Organize Information into JSON Framework**

Using the extracted information, we can organize it according to the predefined JSON framework as follows:

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [

                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G (p.D83G)",
                    "cDNA Change": {

                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            "Readout type": "Quantitative",
            "Readout description": [
                {
                    "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G (p.D83G)",
                    "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
                    "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
                    "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G (p.D83G)"
                }
            ],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that some information is not provided in the abstract and needs to be determined based on general knowledge or additional literature search.

This JSON framework can be used as a starting point for organizing and standardizing the extracted information. The workflow and examples provided demonstrate how to extract relevant information from scientific articles according to the predefined JSON framework.
