Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting and organizing the data from the literature into a JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Use regular expressions or manual extraction to obtain the relevant information from the text.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature via API**

* Use a HGVS API (e.g., [HGVS API](https://github.com/Ensembl/hgvs)) to standardize the nomenclature of each variant.
* This will provide a consistent and accurate representation of the variants' effects.

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied in the Literature and Retrieve Corresponding MONDO Terms**

* Identify the disease studied in the literature from the text.
* Use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding term(s) for the identified disease.
* Ensure that the retrieved term is accurate and up-to-date.

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods Mentioned in the Literature and Extract Detailed Information**

* Identify all experimental methods mentioned in the literature, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
* Use regular expressions or manual extraction to obtain this information from the text.

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods are Generally Used for Studying the Disease**

* Analyze the literature to determine whether the experimental protocol used is generally accepted and applied in the field of study.
* If unsure, consult with experts or review relevant literature to confirm.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information according to Predefined JSON Framework**

* Using the information gathered from the previous steps, fill out the predefined JSON framework as per the provided example.

Here is an updated version of the original code, incorporating the guidelines outlined above:
