Based on the provided specification, I will outline a step-by-step approach to complete the task.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Identify the variants mentioned in the literature, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
* Extract the original text from the literature describing each variant.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants.
* Record the standardized HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Identify the disease mentioned in the literature.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term for the disease using the MONDO database.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Identify all experimental methods mentioned in the literature, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
* Extract the original text from the literature describing each method.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Review the literature to determine whether the experimental protocols used in the study are commonly used for studying the specific disease mentioned.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Use the predefined JSON framework to organize the extracted and standardized information.
* Populate each field with the relevant data, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, MONDO term, experimental methods, readout descriptions, biological replicates, technical replicates, positive controls, negative controls, validation controls, statistical analysis methods, thresholds for normal and abnormal results, and approved assay.
