Based on the provided specification, I will guide you through the process of extracting and standardizing data from a literature document according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A), cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Record these details in a temporary format, such as a spreadsheet or a dictionary.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature via Relevant API**

* Use an HGVS nomenclature standardization tool (e.g., HGVSc) to convert the preliminary HGVS nomenclature into a standardized format.
* Update the stored variant information with the standardized HGVS nomenclature.

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied in the Literature and Retrieve Corresponding MONDO Terms**

* Determine the disease name studied in the functional experiments mentioned in the literature (e.g., Hereditary Myopathy).
* Look up the corresponding MONDO term for this disease (e.g., MONDO:0012345) in the MONDO database.

**Step 4: Extract Detailed Information about Each Experimental Method**

* Identify all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each method, extract the following information:
	+ Assay Method (e.g., Western Blot)
	+ Material used (source, name, and description)
	+ Readout type (qualitative/quantitative)
	+ Result descriptions for each variant (including conclusions, molecular effects, and specific experimental results)
	+ Biological replicates (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Technical replicates (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Basic positive control (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Basic negative control (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (yes/no/N.D., counts)
	+ Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants (yes/no/N.D., counts)
	+ Statistical analysis method
	+ Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts (if described in the literature; otherwise, determine based on own knowledge)
	+ Source of thresholds (literature/custom)

**Step 5: Organize Extracted Information According to Predefined JSON Framework**

* Create a new JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {...},
                    "Protein Change": {...},
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {...},
            "Readout type": "Quantitative",
            "Readout description": [...],
            "Biological replicates": {...},
            "Technical replicates": {...},
            "Basic positive control": {...},
            "Basic negative control": {...},
            "Validation controls P/LP": {...},
            "Validation controls B/LB": {...},
            "Statistical analysis method": "...",
            "Threshold for normal readout": {...},
            "Threshold for abnormal readout": {...},
            "Approved assay": "{...}"
        }
    ]
}
```
Note that this is a simplified example, and the actual JSON structure may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.

**Step 6: Verify and Refine the Extracted Data**

* Review the extracted data for accuracy and completeness.
* Refine any inconsistencies or missing information based on your own knowledge and expertise.

By following these steps, you should be able to extract and standardize relevant data from a literature document according to the predefined JSON framework.
