Given the provided literature, I will follow the specified workflow to extract and organize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

The literature discusses several studies on various diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Hereditary Myopathy. 

- **Parkinson's Disease Study:** This study focused on the variant "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" in the TP53 gene, which is associated with a partial loss-of-function effect.
  
- **Alzheimer's Disease Study:** The study discussed variants in the APP gene, including NM_000483.2:NM_000483.2:c.1705C>T.

- **Hereditary Myopathy Study:** This study examined the effects of the variant "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" in the TP53 gene on protein expression and function.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via Relevant API**

For the variants mentioned, we will standardize their HGVS nomenclature using a relevant API:

- **TP53 Gene Variants:** NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
  
- **APP Gene Variants:** NM_000483.2:NM_000483.2:c.1705C>T

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied and Retrieve Corresponding MONDO Terms**

The studies examined three different diseases:

1. **Hereditary Myopathy:** This disease is associated with the variant "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" in the TP53 gene.
   - MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

2. **Alzheimer's Disease (AD):** No specific MONDO term was mentioned for this study.

3. **Parkinson's Disease (PD):** No specific MONDO term was mentioned for this study.

**Step 4: Extract Detailed Information on Each Experimental Method**

The literature mentions two experimental methods:

1. **Western Blot Assay Method:** This method is used to quantify protein expression.
   - Material Source: Cell line
   - Material Name: HEK293
   - Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
   
2. **CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing Assay Method:** This method is used for gene editing and studying genetic variants' effects on protein function.
   - Material Source: Cell line
   - Material Name: H9 cells
   - Description: "The experiment was conducted using the H9 cell line."

**Step 5: Organize Extracted Information According to Predefined JSON Framework**

Here is the organized information in the predefined JSON format:
