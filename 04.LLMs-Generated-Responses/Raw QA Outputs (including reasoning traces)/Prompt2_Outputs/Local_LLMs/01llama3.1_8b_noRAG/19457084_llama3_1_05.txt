Based on the provided specification, I will provide a detailed answer to the problem.

The problem requires extracting and organizing information from a literature source into a predefined JSON framework. The JSON framework contains several sections, including:

1.  **Variants Include**: This section should include all relevant variant information, such as gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2.  **Described Disease**: This section should contain the disease studied in the literature along with its corresponding MONDO term number retrieved from the MONDO database.
3.  **Experiment Method**: This section should list all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

The following steps will be taken to accomplish this task:

**Step 1: Read Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

*   The first step is to carefully read the literature source and extract all relevant variant information.
*   This includes identifying the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature (cDNA change and protein change), and any additional context provided for each variant.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via Relevant API**

*   Once the variants have been extracted, the next step is to standardize their HGVS nomenclature using a relevant API.
*   This ensures that all HGVS nomenclatures are consistent and follow the standardized format.

**Step 3: Identify Disease Studied in Literature and Retrieve MONDO Term Number**

*   After extracting variant information and standardizing HGVS nomenclatures, the next task is to identify the disease studied in the literature.
*   Once the disease has been identified, its corresponding MONDO term number will be retrieved from the MONDO database.

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

*   With variant information standardized and the disease identified, the focus shifts to listing all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
*   For each method, detailed information should be extracted, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

**Step 5: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information According to Predefined JSON Framework**

*   The final step involves organizing the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.
*   This includes populating each section of the JSON with relevant information from the literature source.

By following these steps, the required information will be accurately extracted and organized in a consistent and structured format within the predefined JSON framework.
