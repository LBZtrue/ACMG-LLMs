To answer this question, I will guide you through the process of extracting and organizing data from a given literature piece into a predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Extracting variant information**

From the provided example, we can see that there is a variant mentioned in the TP53 gene. We need to extract the following information for each variant:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number
	+ Reference nucleotide
	+ Alternative nucleotide
	+ Variant position
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid
	+ Alternative amino acid
	+ Variant position

The extracted information for the variant in the example is:

```
"Variants Include": [
    {
        "Gene": "TP53",
        "variants": [
            {
                "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                "cDNA Change": {
                    "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                    "ref": "G",
                    "alt": "A",
                    "position": "248"
                },
                "Protein Change": {
                    "ref": "G",
                    "alt": "D",
                    "position": "83"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

**Step 2: Standardizing HGVS nomenclature**

We need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature via a relevant API. For this example, I will assume we have an API that can take the preliminary HGVS nomenclature (c.248G>A) and return the standardized HGVS nomenclature.

The output from the API for the given variant is:

```
"NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A"
```

We can update the extracted information to reflect this change:

```
"Variants Include": [
    {
        "Gene": "TP53",
        "variants": [
            {
                "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                "cDNA Change": {
                    "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                    "ref": "G",
                    "alt": "A",
                    "position": "248"
                },
                "Protein Change": {
                    "ref": "G",
                    "alt": "D",
                    "position": "83"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

**Step 3: Identifying the disease studied**

From the example, we can see that the disease studied is Hereditary Myopathy. We need to retrieve the corresponding MONDO term.

The output from the MONDO database for the given disease is:

```
"MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
```

We can update the extracted information to reflect this change:

```
"Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
}
```

**Step 4: Extracting experimental method details**

From the example, we can see that the experimental method used was Western Blot. We need to extract the following information:

* Assay Method
* Material used:
	+ Material Source
	+ Material Name
	+ Description
* Readout type
* Readout description (which should contain all the variants mentioned in the "Variants Include" section)
* Biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed
	+ Description of the number of biological replicates
* Technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed
	+ Description of the number of technical replicates
* Basic positive control:
	+ Whether a basic positive control was set up
	+ Description of the positive control
* Basic negative control:
	+ Whether a basic negative control was set up
	+ Description of the negative control
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Whether validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included
	+ Number of validation controls
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Whether validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were included
	+ Number of validation controls
* Statistical analysis method
* Threshold for normal readout
* Threshold for abnormal readout

The extracted information for the Western Blot experimental method is:

```
"Experiment Method": [
    {
        "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
        "Material used": {
            "Material Source": "Cell line",
            "Material Name": "HEK293",
            "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
        },
        "Readout type": "Quantitative",
        "Readout description": [
            {
                "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
                "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
                "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
            }
        ],
        "Biological replicates": {
            "Biological replicates": "Yes",
            "Description": "Three biological replicates were performed."
        },
        "Technical replicates": {
            "Technical replicates": "Yes",
            "Description": "Each sample was run in triplicate."
        },
        "Basic positive control": {
            "Basic positive control": "Yes",
            "Description": "Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control."
        },
        "Basic negative control": {
            "Basic negative control": "Yes",
            "Description": "Empty vector was used as a negative control."
        },
        "Validation controls P/LP": {
            "Validation controls P/LP": "Yes",
            "Counts": "2"
        },
        "Validation controls B/LB": {
            "Validation controls B/LB": "Yes",
            "Counts": "1"
        },
        "Statistical analysis method": {
            "Statistical analysis method": "ANOVA was used for statistical analysis."
        },
        "Threshold for normal readout": {
            "Threshold for normal readout": "Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.",
            "Source": "Literature"
        },
        "Threshold for abnormal readout": {
            "Threshold for abnormal readout": "Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.",
            "Source": "Literature"
        },
        "Approved assay": {
            "Approved assay": "Yes"
        }
    }
]
```

**Step 5: Determining whether the experimental method is approved**

Based on the extracted information, we can see that the Western Blot experimental method used in this study is generally used for studying Hereditary Myopathy. Therefore, the value for "Approved assay" is:

```
"Approved assay": {
    "Approved assay": "Yes"
}
```

**Step 6: Organizing the extracted and standardized information**

We can now combine all the extracted and standardized information into a single JSON object:
