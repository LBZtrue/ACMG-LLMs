Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will provide a step-by-step solution to extract and organize the relevant information from the literature.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

From the provided example, we can assume that the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

Extracted information:

* Gene: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using a relevant API, such as Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser, we can standardize the HGVS nomenclature.

Standardized HGVS nomenclature:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

From the provided example, we know that the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

Extracted information:

* Disease name: Hereditary Myopathy
* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

From the provided example, we can assume that the literature mentions a Western Blot experiment.

Extracted information:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

Based on general knowledge, Western Blot is a commonly used method for studying protein expression and is suitable for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

Extracted information:

* Approved assay: Yes

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Using the provided JSON framework, we can organize the extracted and standardized information as follows:
