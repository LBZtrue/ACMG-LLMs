To solve this problem, I'll follow the steps outlined in the workflow and use the examples provided.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

The literature provides information about a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D). The disease studied is Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using an HGVS nomenclature standardization tool or API, we can standardize the variant "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" to its final form.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The disease studied is Hereditary Myopathy, with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

The literature mentions a Western Blot assay as the experimental method. We can extract detailed information about this method:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

Based on general knowledge, Western Blot is a widely used and approved assay method for studying protein expression.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Here's the final JSON output:
