Based on the provided specifications, I will provide a Python solution for extracting and organizing the information from the literature.

```python

This Python script uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML of the literature and extract relevant information. It then standardizes the HGVS nomenclature using a relevant API. The disease name is used to retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database. Finally, it organizes the extracted and standardized information into a JSON object according to the predefined framework.

Note: This script assumes that the literature text is stored in a file named `literature.txt` at the specified URL. You will need to replace this with your actual literature source. Additionally, you will need to obtain an API key for the MONDO database and the HGVS nomenclature standardization service.
