I'll guide you through the process of extracting and standardizing information from a literature example.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

Assume we have a research paper that mentions a study on the TP53 gene. The paper describes a variant, c.248G>A (p.G83D), which causes structural changes in the protein, affecting its function.

From the paper, extract:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Variant position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Variant position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using a suitable API (e.g., Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor), standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature to the final HGVS format:

NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A → NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

From the paper, identify the disease studied as "Hereditary Myopathy." Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term:

MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

Assume the paper mentions a Western Blot experiment. Extract detailed information for this experiment:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description (for each variant mentioned in the literature):
	+ NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G:
		- Conclusion: Abnormal
		- Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
		- Specific description of the experimental result: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP (pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants):
	+ Yes
	+ Counts: 2
* Validation controls B/LB (benign/likely benign variants):
	+ Yes
	+ Counts: 1
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Approved assay:
	+ Yes

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

From the paper, it appears that the Western Blot experiment is commonly used to study protein expression in Hereditary Myopathy. Therefore:

Approved assay → Yes

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Using the extracted information, fill out the following JSON structure:
