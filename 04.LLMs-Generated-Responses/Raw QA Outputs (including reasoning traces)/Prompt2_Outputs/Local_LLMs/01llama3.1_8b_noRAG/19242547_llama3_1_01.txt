Based on the provided specifications, I will provide a detailed answer to the given problem.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

The literature mentions variants in several genes. For example, one variant is mentioned as "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" with protein change "p.G83D". This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature of Variants via Relevant API**

Using the API for standardizing HGVS nomenclature, we can get the standardized version of the variant as "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A".

**Step 3: Identify Disease Studied in Literature and Retrieve Corresponding MONDO Terms**

The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy", with corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

The experimental methods mentioned are:

1. Western Blot
2. Quantitative PCR

For each method, we will extract detailed information such as material used, readout type, result description, biological replicates, technical replicates, basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls P/LP, validation controls B/LB, statistical analysis method, threshold for normal readout, threshold for abnormal readout, and approved assay.

**Step 5: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information According to Predefined JSON Framework**

The organized information will be in the following format:
