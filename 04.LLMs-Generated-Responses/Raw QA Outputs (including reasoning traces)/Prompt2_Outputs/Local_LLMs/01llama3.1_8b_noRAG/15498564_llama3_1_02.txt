```

This code assumes that the literature text is stored in a variable named `literature_text`. The output will be a JSON object containing the extracted information. Note that this implementation uses placeholder values for some variables (e.g., API calls to standardize HGVS nomenclature) and may need to be modified based on your specific requirements.

To run this code, you can simply save it as a Python script and execute it using `python <script_name>.py`. This will output the JSON object containing the extracted information.
