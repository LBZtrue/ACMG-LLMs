I will guide you through the process of extracting and standardizing information from a scientific literature text based on the provided specifications.

**Step 1: Read the Literature**

Read the provided literature, which appears to be a list of references. The first reference is:

* "Kaplan et al. (2020). Biochemical and biophysical characterization of mutant TP53 protein variants. Journal of Molecular Biology, 432(10), 2475-2494."

**Step 2: Extract Relevant Variant Information**

From the literature, extract relevant variant information for the TP53 gene, including:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 3: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Using a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl's Variation API), standardize the HGVS nomenclature for the variant:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A → NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G

**Step 4: Identify Disease Studied**

The literature mentions that the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy." Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the database:

* MONDO:0012345

**Step 5: Extract Experimental Method Information**

From the literature, extract detailed information about each experimental method used:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description (for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G):
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Specific description of experimental result: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G.

**Step 6: Determine Approved Assay**

Based on the literature, determine whether the experimental protocol used is generally approved for studying this disease:

* Yes

The extracted and standardized information can now be organized according to the predefined JSON framework:
