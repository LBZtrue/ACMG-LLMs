This code is a general solution to extract and standardize the variant information from the literature. It uses regular expressions to find specific patterns in the text, such as gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. The `standardize_hgvs` function implements an API call to standardize HGVS nomenclature for demonstration purposes. Please replace this with a real API call.

Please note that you should replace the hardcoded values in the code with actual data from your literature text. Also, ensure that the regular expressions and patterns used are correct based on your specific use case.
