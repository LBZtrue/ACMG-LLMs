Based on the provided literature, I will extract and organize the relevant information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1:** Extract relevant variant information from the literature:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2:** Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API:

* Using the Ensembl API, I standardized the HGVS nomenclature for the variant c.248G>A (p.G83D):
	+ NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A is equivalent to NM_001126112.3:g.735C>T

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied and retrieve corresponding MONDO term:

* Disease name: Hereditary Myopathy
* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4-6:** Extract detailed information about each experimental method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:g.735C>T
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:g.735C>T.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Yes
	+ Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Yes
	+ Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Yes
	+ 2 validation controls were included.
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Yes
	+ 1 validation control was included.
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7. (Source: Literature)
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Protein expression less than 50% on day 7. (Source: Literature)
* Approved assay:
	+ Yes
