Based on the provided literature and the predefined JSON framework, I will extract and organize the relevant information according to the workflow.

**1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

From the given example:

* Variant in TP53 gene: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* Disease studied: Hereditary Myopathy

**2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using a relevant API, such as Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), we can standardize the HGVS nomenclature:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

According to the example, the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term: "MONDO:0012345"

**4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

From the given example:

* Experimental Method 1:
	+ Assay Method: Western Blot
	+ Material used:
		- Material Source: Cell line
		- Material Name: HEK293
		- Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
	+ Readout type: Quantitative
	+ Readout description (for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A):
		- Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
		- Conclusion: Abnormal
		- Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
		- Result Description: "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
	+ Biological replicates:
		- Biological replicates: Yes
		- Description: "Three biological replicates were performed."
	+ Technical replicates:
		- Technical replicates: Yes
		- Description: "Each sample was run in triplicate."
	+ Basic positive control:
		- Basic positive control: Yes
		- Description: "Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control."
	+ Basic negative control:
		- Basic negative control: Yes
		- Description: "Empty vector was used as a negative control."
	+ Validation controls P/LP:
		- Validation controls P/LP: Yes
		- Counts: 2
	+ Validation controls B/LB:
		- Validation controls B/LB: Yes
		- Counts: 1
	+ Statistical analysis method:
		- Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
	+ Threshold for normal readout:
		- Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.
		- Source: Literature
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout:
		- Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
		- Source: Literature
	+ Approved assay:
		- Approved assay: Yes

**5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

Based on the example, Western Blot is a commonly used method for studying protein expression in cell lines, and it is approved for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

**6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

The final output will be:
