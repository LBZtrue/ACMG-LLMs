Based on the provided instructions and example, I will outline a step-by-step approach to extract and organize data from the literature.

### Step 1: Extract Relevant Variant Information

1. Identify gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A), cDNA changes, and protein changes mentioned in the literature.
2. For each variant:
   - Record the HGVS nomenclature as it appears in the literature.
   - Extract transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and variant position from the preliminary HGVS nomenclature.
   - Determine the corresponding protein change (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and variant position) using tools like SnpEff or Alamut Batch.
3. Organize extracted information into the "Variants Include" section of the JSON framework.

### Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature

1. Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl's Variation API) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
2. Update the standardized HGVS nomenclature in the "Variants Include" section of the JSON framework.

### Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Terms

1. Determine the disease name mentioned in the literature.
2. Search the MONDO database for corresponding terms (e.g., MONDO:0012345).
3. Organize this information into the "Described Disease" section of the JSON framework.

### Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information

1. Identify all experimental methods used (e.g., Western Blot, PCR).
2. For each method:
   - Record the assay name and any relevant descriptions from the literature.
   - Determine material sources, names, and original text describing materials.
   - Decide if the readout type is qualitative or quantitative.
   - List variants mentioned in the context of this experimental method.
     * Extract conclusion (abnormal/normal), molecular effect, and a specific result description for each variant.
   - Identify whether biological replicate experiments were performed and provide relevant text from the literature.
   - Indicate if technical replicates were done and note any descriptions related to these experiments.
   - Determine if basic positive and negative controls were set up and include relevant text describing them.
   - Note the inclusion of validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P/LP) and benign/likely benign variants (B/LB), along with the number of such controls.
   - Record the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol.
   - Identify thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts, noting their source (literature or custom).
   - Determine if the experimental protocol is generally approved for studying this disease.

### Step 5: Organize Extracted Information into JSON Framework

1. Populate each section of the JSON framework with the extracted data:
   * "Variants Include" with standardized HGVS nomenclature and detailed variant information.
   * "Described Disease" with the identified disease name and corresponding MONDO term.
   * Each experimental method in the "Experiment Method" section, including detailed descriptions as outlined above.

### Example Implementation (Simplified for Demonstration)

Below is a simplified example implementation using Python. It highlights the steps involved in data extraction and organization into the JSON framework:

```python
import json

# Function to standardize HGVS nomenclature
def standardize_hgvs(nom):
    # Simulate API call for simplicity
    return "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A"

# Function to extract experimental method information
def get_experiment_details(text):
    # Parse text to identify key details (material, readout type, etc.)
    material_source = ""
    assay_name = ""
    variants_mentioned = []
    
    # For demonstration, return placeholder data
    return {
        "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
        "Material used": {"Source": "Cell line", "Name": "HEK293"},
        "Readout type": "Quantitative",
        "Variants Mentioned": [{"HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A"}]
    }

# Sample data
literature_text = """
The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
c.248G>A (p.G83D) variant causes structural change in protein, affecting function.
"""

# Main program loop
data = {
    "Variants Include": [],
    "Described Disease": {"Described Disease": "", "MONDO": ""},
    "Experiment Method": []
}

variant_info = get_variant_info(literature_text)
for info in variant_info:
    standardized_nom = standardize_hgvs(info["HGVS"])
    data["Variants Include"].append({
        "Gene": "",
        "variants": [
            {
                "HGVS": standardized_nom,
                # Other fields...
            }
        ]
    })

disease_info = get_disease_info(literature_text)
data["Described Disease"]["Described Disease"] = disease_info["Disease Name"]
data["Described Disease"]["MONDO"] = disease_info["Mondo Term"]

experimental_method = get_experiment_details(literature_text)
data["Experiment Method"].append(experimental_method)

# Convert data to JSON
output_json = json.dumps(data, indent=4)

print(output_json)
```

### Notes

- This example implementation is highly simplified and doesn't cover error handling or extensive logic for extracting detailed information from the literature.
- Real-world applications would require integrating with external APIs for tasks like standardizing HGVS nomenclature and retrieving MONDO terms.
