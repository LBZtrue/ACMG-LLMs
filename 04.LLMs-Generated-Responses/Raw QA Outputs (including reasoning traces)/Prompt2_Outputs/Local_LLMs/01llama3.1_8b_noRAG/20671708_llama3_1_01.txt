Based on the provided literature, I will follow the specified workflow to extract and standardize the relevant information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Extract variant information**

The literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature**

Using the relevant API, I will standardize the HGVS nomenclature to:
NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify the disease and retrieve MONDO term**

The literature mentions that the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy."

* Disease name: Hereditary Myopathy
* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345 (retrieved from the MONDO database)

**Step 4: Extract experimental method information**

The literature mentions a Western Blot experiment.

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:

| Variant | Conclusion | Molecular Effect | Result Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A | Abnormal | partial loss-of-function | Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A. |

**Step 5: Determine whether experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

The literature does not provide information about the experimental methods being generally used for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

* Approved assay: N.D.

Here is the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
