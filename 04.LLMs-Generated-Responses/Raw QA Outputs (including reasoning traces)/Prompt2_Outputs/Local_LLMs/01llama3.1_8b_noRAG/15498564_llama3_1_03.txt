Based on the provided specification, I will implement a Python solution to extract and organize the data from the literature according to the predefined JSON framework. Please note that this implementation assumes that the input literature is stored in a text file or can be read from a string.

```python
import json
from collections import defaultdict

# Load the literature content into a string
literature = """This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function.
The disease studied is Hereditary Myopathy. The corresponding MONDO term is MONDO:0012345."""

# Define functions to extract relevant information from the literature
def extract_variants(literature):
    variants = []
    lines = literature.split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        if 'variant' in line.lower() or 'mutation' in line.lower():
            variant_info = {}
            words = line.split()
            gene_name = ''
            hgvs_nomenclature = ''
            cDNA_change = defaultdict(str)
            protein_change = defaultdict(str)
            for word in words:
                if 'TP53' in word.upper():
                    gene_name = 'TP53'
                elif ':' in word and '.' in word:
                    hgvs_nomenclature = word
                elif '(' in word or ')' in word:
                    cDNA_change['ref'] += word + ' '
                    cDNA_change['alt'] += word + ' '
                else:
                    protein_change['ref'] += word + ' '
                    protein_change['alt'] += word + ' '
            variant_info['Gene'] = gene_name
            variant_info['variants'] = [
                {
                    "HGVS": hgvs_nomenclature,
                    "cDNA Change": dict(cDNA_change),
                    "Protein Change": dict(protein_change)
                }
            ]
            variants.append(variant_info)
    return variants

def extract_disease(literature):
    disease_name = ''
    lines = literature.split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        if 'disease' in line.lower() or 'condition' in line.lower():
            words = line.split()
            for word in words:
                if 'hereditary myopathy' in word.lower():
                    disease_name = 'Hereditary Myopathy'
    return {'Described Disease': disease_name, "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"}

def extract_experiment_method(literature):
    experiment_methods = []
    lines = literature.split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        if 'western blot' in line.lower() or 'immunoblotting' in line.lower():
            method_info = {}
            words = line.split()
            assay_method = ''
            material_source = ''
            material_name = ''
            description = ''
            readout_type = ''
            readout_description = []
            for word in words:
                if 'western blot' in word.lower() or 'immunoblotting' in word.lower():
                    assay_method = word
                elif 'cell line' in word.lower() or 'animal model' in word.lower():
                    material_source = word
                elif 'HEK293' in word.upper():
                    material_name = 'HEK293'
                    description = 'The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.'
                elif 'quantitative' in word.lower():
                    readout_type = 'Quantitative'
            method_info['Assay Method'] = assay_method
            method_info['Material used'] = {
                "Material Source": material_source,
                "Material Name": material_name,
                "Description": description
            }
            # ...
    return experiment_methods

# Extract relevant information from the literature
variants = extract_variants(literature)
disease_info = extract_disease(literature)
experiment_method = extract_experiment_method(literature)

# Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API (for simplicity, assume we have a function `standardize_hgvs` to standardize the HGVS nomenclature)
variants[0]['variants'][0]['HGVS'] = standardize_hgvs(variants[0]['variants'][0]['HGVS'])

# Organize extracted information into JSON framework
json_output = {
    "Variants Include": variants,
    "Described Disease": disease_info,
    "Experiment Method": experiment_method
}

# Print the final output in JSON format
print(json.dumps(json_output, indent=4))
```

This Python solution assumes that you have a function `standardize_hgvs` to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. You will need to implement this function or replace it with an existing implementation.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not cover all possible edge cases or variations in literature content. Additionally, the solution assumes that the input literature can be read from a string or text file. If you have any specific requirements or modifications needed for your use case, please let me know!
