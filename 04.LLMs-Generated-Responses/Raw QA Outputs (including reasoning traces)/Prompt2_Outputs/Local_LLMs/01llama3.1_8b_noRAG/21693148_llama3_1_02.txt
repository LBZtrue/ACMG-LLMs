Based on the provided specification, I will create a step-by-step guide to extract and organize the information from the literature.

**Step 1: Extract Variant Information**

* Read the literature and identify relevant variant information, including:
	+ Gene name
	+ Preliminary HGVS nomenclature
	+ cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position)
	+ Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position)

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants.

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* Identify the disease studied in the literature.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* Extract detailed information about each method, including:
	+ Material sources (cell line, animal model, patients-derived material)
	+ Readout types (qualitative or quantitative)
	+ Result descriptions for each variant
	+ Experimental replicates (biological and technical)
	+ Control settings (positive and negative controls)
	+ Validation controls (pathogenic/likely pathogenic and benign/likely benign variants)

**Step 5: Determine Approved Assay**

* Determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted Information into JSON Framework**

* Use the predefined JSON framework to organize the extracted and standardized information, including:
	+ Variants Include section
	+ Described Disease section
	+ Experiment Method section

Here's an example of how the final JSON output would look like:
