Based on the provided specification, I will guide you through a step-by-step process to extract and organize the required information from the literature.

### Step 1: Extract Relevant Variant Information
Identify all variants mentioned in the literature. For each variant:

- **Gene Name**: Record the gene name associated with the variant.
- **Preliminary HGVS Nomenclature**: Identify the preliminary HGVS nomenclature for the variant, if provided.
- **cDNA Changes**: Extract the cDNA change information, including:
  - **Transcript Number**: The transcript number associated with the variant.
  - **Reference Nucleotide (ref)**: The reference nucleotide in the variant position.
  - **Alternative Nucleotide (alt)**: The alternative nucleotide present at the variant position.
  - **Position**: The position of the variant on the cDNA sequence.
- **Protein Changes**: Extract protein change information, including:
  - **Reference Amino Acid (ref)**: The reference amino acid in the variant position.
  - **Alternative Amino Acid (alt)**: The alternative amino acid present at the variant position.
  - **Position**: The position of the variant on the protein sequence.

### Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API
Use a relevant API to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature for each variant. This step is crucial for ensuring that the HGVS nomenclature is accurately represented and easily comparable across different databases and studies.

### Step 3: Identify Described Disease and MONDO Term
Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve its corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

### Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information
For each experimental method mentioned:

- **Assay Method**: Record the name of the assay method used.
- **Material Used**:
  - **Source**: Identify the source of the material (e.g., cell line, animal model, patient-derived material).
  - **Name**: Note the specific name of the material used in the experiment.
  - **Description**: Record any description provided about the material in the literature.
- **Readout Type**: Determine whether the readouts were qualitative or quantitative.
- **Readout Description**:
  - For each variant, record its HGVS nomenclature and extract information on:
    - **Conclusion**: Whether the experimental result was abnormal or normal for the specific variant.
    - **Molecular Effect**: The molecular effect of the variant (e.g., complete loss-of-function, partial loss-of-function).
    - **Result Description**: Provide a detailed description of the experimental result for each variant mentioned in the literature.

### Step 5: Organize Information into JSON Framework
Using the extracted and standardized information, organize it according to the predefined JSON framework. This includes filling in fields such as "Variants Include," "Described Disease," and "Experiment Method" with the appropriate data.

Here's an example of how the final output might look based on the provided specification and the example given:

```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "cDNA Change": {
            "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "A",
            "position": "248"
          },
          "Protein Change": {
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "D",
            "position": "83"
          },
          "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
  },
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      // Rest of the experimental method information
    }
  ]
}
```

This process should result in a comprehensive dataset that encapsulates all relevant details about the variants, disease, and experimental methods studied in the literature.
