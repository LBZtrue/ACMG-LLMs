Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to extract and organize the information from the literature into a JSON format.

**Step 1: Extract Variant Information**

* Read the literature and identify all variants mentioned.
* For each variant:
	+ Extract gene name
	+ Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
	+ cDNA changes (transcript, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position)
	+ Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position)

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* Read the literature and identify the disease studied.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the database.

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each method:
	+ Extract assay name (e.g., Western Blot)
	+ Material source, material name, and description
	+ Readout type (quantitative or qualitative)
	+ Result descriptions for each variant (including conclusion, molecular effect, and result description)

**Step 5: Determine Approved Assay**

* Based on the literature, determine whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted Information into JSON Format**

* Use the predefined JSON framework to organize the extracted and standardized information.
* Ensure that each field is populated with the correct data, including:
	+ `Variants Include`: gene name, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes
	+ `Described Disease`: disease name, MONDO term
	+ `Experiment Method`: assay name, material source, readout type, result descriptions, biological replicates, technical replicates, basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls, statistical analysis method, thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts, approved assay

Here is an example of what the final JSON output might look like:

This example shows the extracted information from the literature, including variant details, disease name and MONDO term, experimental method information, and thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts. The final JSON output is organized according to the predefined framework, with each field populated with the correct data.
