Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will demonstrate how to extract relevant information from the given literature.

### Step 1: Extract Relevant Variant Information
Read the literature and note down all relevant variant information including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. 

For example:
- Gene: TP53 
- Preliminary HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
- cDNA Change: NM_001126112.3
  * ref: G
  * alt: A
  * position: 248
- Protein Change:
  * ref: G
  * alt: D
  * position: 83

### Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature Using API
Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of variants via a relevant API.

For example, using the API for standardizing HGVS nomenclature, the preliminary HGVS "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" is standardized to "NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G".

### Step 3: Identify Disease Studied in Literature and Retrieve MONDO Term
Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

For example, based on the literature, the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy", with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

### Step 4: List All Experimental Methods Mentioned in Literature
List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

For example:
- Assay Method: Western Blot
- Material used:
  * Source: Cell line
  * Name: HEK293
  * Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
- Readout type: Quantitative

### Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods Are Generally Used for Studying Disease
Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease.

For example, based on the literature and general knowledge, the Western Blot assay is indeed commonly used for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

### Step 6: Organize Extracted Information According to JSON Framework

Here's an example of how the extracted information can be organized according to the predefined JSON framework:
