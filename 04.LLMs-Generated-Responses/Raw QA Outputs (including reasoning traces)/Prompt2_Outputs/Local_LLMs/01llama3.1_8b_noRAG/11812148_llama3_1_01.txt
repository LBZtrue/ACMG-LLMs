Based on the provided specifications, I will outline a step-by-step solution to extract and organize the required information from the literature.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

* Identify all relevant variants mentioned in the literature.
* Extract gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant.
* Record descriptions of each variant in their respective contexts.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants extracted in Step 1.

**Step 3: Identify Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* Identify the disease studied in the literature.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* Extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

**Step 5: Determine Approved Assay**

* Determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying the disease.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

* Use the predefined JSON framework to organize the extracted and standardized information.
* Ensure that each variant's information is correctly linked to its corresponding experiment method.

Here is an example of how the final output might look:
