Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to create the output JSON file. Please note that this is a complex task requiring manual extraction and organization of information from the literature.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract relevant variant information**

* Extract gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant.
* Store this information in a data structure, such as an array or object, to facilitate organization and reference.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API**

* Use the standardized HGVS API to convert the preliminary nomenclature into a standardized format (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A).
* Store the standardized HGVS nomenclature in the data structure.

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

* Extract the disease name mentioned in the literature.
* Use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding term (e.g., "MONDO:0012345").
* Store this information in the data structure.

**Step 4: List experimental methods and extract detailed information**

* Extract the names of experimental methods mentioned in the literature (e.g., Western Blot).
* For each method, extract detailed information such as:
	+ Material source and name
	+ Readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
	+ Result descriptions for each variant
	+ Biological replicates and description
	+ Technical replicates and description
	+ Basic positive control and description
	+ Basic negative control and description
	+ Validation controls (pathogenic/likely pathogenic and benign/likely benign) and counts
	+ Statistical analysis method used
	+ Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts, including source (literature or custom)
* Store this information in the data structure.

**Step 5: Determine whether experimental methods are approved assays**

* Review the literature to determine if the experimental protocol is generally used for studying the disease.
* Store this information as a "yes" or "no" value in the data structure.

**Step 6: Organize extracted and standardized information into JSON framework**

* Use the predefined JSON framework as a template to organize the extracted and standardized information.
* Ensure that all required fields are populated with accurate information from the literature.

The final output will be a JSON file containing the organized and standardized information, as demonstrated in the example:
