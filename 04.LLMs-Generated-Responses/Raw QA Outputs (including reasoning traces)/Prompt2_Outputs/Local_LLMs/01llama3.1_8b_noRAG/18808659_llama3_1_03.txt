Based on the provided specification, I will outline a step-by-step approach to extract and standardize the information from the literature into the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature**

Read the provided text carefully to understand its content. The text appears to be a list of scientific papers related to genetic variants in different genes.

**Step 2: Extract Variant Information**

Extract the relevant variant information, including:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number
	+ Reference nucleotide
	+ Alternative nucleotide
	+ Position of the variant
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid
	+ Alternative amino acid
	+ Position of the variant

Example extracted information for a single variant:

| Gene | Preliminary HGVS nomenclature | cDNA Changes | Protein Changes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TP53 | NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A | NM_001126112.3, G, A, 248 | p.G83D |

**Step 3: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl or UCSC) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

Example standardized information:

| Gene | Preliminary HGVS nomenclature | cDNA Changes | Protein Changes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TP53 | NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A | NM_001126112.3, G, A, 248 | p.G83D |

**Step 4: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve its corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

Example:

| Described Disease | MONDO |
| --- | --- |
| Hereditary Myopathy | MONDO:0012345 |

**Step 5: Extract Experimental Method Information**

Extract detailed information about each experimental method mentioned in the literature, including:

* Assay method (e.g., Western Blot)
* Material used:
	+ Source of material
	+ Name of material
	+ Description of material
* Readout type (e.g., Quantitative)
* Result description:
	+ Variant HGVS nomenclature
	+ Conclusion (Abnormal/Normal)
	+ Molecular effect (partial loss-of-function, etc.)
	+ Specific result description

Example extracted information for a single experimental method:

| Assay Method | Material used | Readout type | Readout Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Western Blot | HEK293 cell line | Quantitative | NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A, Abnormal, partial loss-of-function, Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A |

**Step 6: Organize Information into JSON Framework**

Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Example final output:

```

                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [

                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            "Readout type": "Quantitative",
            "Readout description": [
                {
                    "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
                    "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
                    "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
                }
            ],
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

This example final output demonstrates how the extracted and standardized information can be organized into the predefined JSON framework.
