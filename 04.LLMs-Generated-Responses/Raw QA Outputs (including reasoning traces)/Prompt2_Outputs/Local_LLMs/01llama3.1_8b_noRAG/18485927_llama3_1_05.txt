This answer includes the following information:

* The gene name is TP53.
* The standardized HGVS nomenclature of the variant is NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* The disease studied in the literature is Hereditary Myopathy, with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".
* The experimental method used was Western Blot.
* The material used was a cell line (HEK293), and it was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* The readout type was Quantitative.
* The conclusion of the experimental result for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A was Abnormal, with a partial loss-of-function molecular effect.
* Biological replicates were performed (three biological replicates).
* Technical replicates were performed (each sample was run in triplicate).
* A basic positive control was set up (wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control), and a basic negative control was also set up (empty vector was used as a negative control).
* Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included (2 counts).
* Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were not mentioned.
* The statistical analysis method used was ANOVA.
* The threshold for normal readout is protein expression greater than 80% on day 7, according to the literature.
