Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting relevant information from a scientific literature article.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

Assume we are given an article titled "Functional Analysis of TP53 Variants in Hereditary Myopathy" (not provided). We need to identify the variants mentioned in the article, including their preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

We will use an HGVS API (e.g., Ensembl or RefSeq) to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature. For example:

| Preliminary HGVS | Standardized HGVS |
| --- | --- |
| NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A | NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D) |

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The article mentions that the study focuses on "Hereditary Myopathy." We will search for the corresponding MONDO term, which is "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

Assume the article describes a Western Blot experiment using the HEK293 cell line. We need to extract details about this experiment, including:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description (for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A):
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease**

We will assess whether the Western Blot experiment is a standard or approved method for studying Hereditary Myopathy. Based on our knowledge, we can conclude that the Western Blot experiment is an approved assay (Yes).

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Here's the resulting JSON structure:
