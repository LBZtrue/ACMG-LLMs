Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will outline the steps to follow for this task:

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes mentioned in the literature.
* Record these details in a table or spreadsheet for easy reference.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use a reputable API (e.g., Ensembl, HGMD) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of each variant.
* Record the standardized HGVS nomenclature in the table or spreadsheet.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Read the literature to identify the disease(s) studied.
* Use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding term(s) for each disease.
* Record the disease name and MONDO term number in the table or spreadsheet.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Read the literature to identify each experimental method used (e.g., Western Blot, qPCR).
* Extract detailed information about each method, including:
	+ Material source (cell line, animal model, patient-derived material)
	+ Material name
	+ Description of the material in the original text
	+ Readout type (qualitative, quantitative)
	+ Readout description for each variant mentioned
	+ Biological replicates performed (yes/no)
	+ Technical replicates performed (yes/no)
	+ Basic positive control set up (yes/no)
	+ Basic negative control set up (yes/no)
	+ Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants included (yes/no) and counts
	+ Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants included (yes/no) and counts
	+ Statistical analysis method used
	+ Threshold for normal readout and source
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout and source
	+ Whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease (yes/no)
* Record this information in a table or spreadsheet.

**Step 5: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Use the JSON framework provided as a guide to organize the extracted and standardized information into the required format.
* Ensure that all fields are filled with accurate and relevant data from the literature.

The final output will be a JSON object containing the extracted and standardized information, organized according to the predefined framework. The example provided shows what this might look like:
```json

      ],
      // ... (insert other fields here)
    }
  ]
}
