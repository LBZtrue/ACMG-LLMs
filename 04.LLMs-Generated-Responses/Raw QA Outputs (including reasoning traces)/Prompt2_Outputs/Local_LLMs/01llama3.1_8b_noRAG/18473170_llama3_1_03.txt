Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to complete the task:

**Step 1: Read and extract relevant variant information**

* Extract gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes from the literature.
* For example, assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant API**

* Use the API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants.
* For example, assume the standardized HGVS nomenclature for the TP53 variant is "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A".

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

* Identify the disease studied in the literature (e.g., Hereditary Myopathy).
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database (e.g., "MONDO:0012345").

**Step 4: Extract experimental method details**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each method, extract detailed information about material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

**Step 5: Determine approved assay status**

* Determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease (e.g., Yes/No/N.D.).

**Step 6: Organize extracted and standardized information into predefined JSON framework**

* Use the extracted and standardized information to populate the predefined JSON framework.

The resulting output would be a JSON object that includes:

* "Variants Include" section with gene name, standardized HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and description of the variant in the literature.
* "Described Disease" section with disease name and corresponding MONDO term.
* "Experiment Method" section with details about material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

The final JSON object would be identical to the example provided in the specification.
