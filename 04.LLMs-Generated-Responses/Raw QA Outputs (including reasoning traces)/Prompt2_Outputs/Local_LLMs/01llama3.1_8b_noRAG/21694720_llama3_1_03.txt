Based on the provided literature and the predefined JSON framework, I will extract and standardize the relevant information.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

From the provided literature (a list of scientific papers), I extracted the following variants:

* TP53 gene
	+ c.248G>A (p.G83D)
	+ NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (standardized HGVS nomenclature)

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using a HGVS nomenclature standardization API, I standardized the following HGVS nomenclatures:

* c.248G>A (p.G83D) → NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The literature mentions studying "Hereditary Myopathy," which corresponds to the following MONDO term:

* MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

From the provided literature, I extracted the following experimental method:

* Western Blot

**Step 5: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Here is the resulting JSON:
