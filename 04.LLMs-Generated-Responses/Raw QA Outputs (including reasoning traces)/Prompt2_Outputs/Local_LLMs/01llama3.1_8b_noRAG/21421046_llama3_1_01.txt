Based on the provided specifications, here's a step-by-step guide to extracting and organizing data from the literature into the predefined JSON framework:

**Step 1: Read Literature and Extract Variant Information**

* Identify relevant variants mentioned in the literature.
* For each variant:
	+ Extract gene name
	+ Extract preliminary HGVS nomenclature (if not already available)
	+ Determine cDNA change information (transcript, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position)
	+ Determine protein change information (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position)

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* Identify the disease studied in the literature.
* Search the MONDO database for the corresponding term.

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each method:
	+ Extract assay name (e.g., Western Blot)
	+ Extract material used information (source, name, description)
	+ Determine readout type (qualitative/quantitative)
	+ Extract result descriptions for each variant
	+ Determine biological and technical replicate information
	+ Determine positive and negative control settings
	+ Determine statistical analysis method used
	+ Determine thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts

**Step 5: Organize Data into JSON Framework**

* Create a new entry in the "Variants Include" array for each variant.
* Fill out relevant fields (gene, HGVS, cDNA change, protein change) with extracted information.
* Create a new entry in the "Described Disease" object with disease name and corresponding MONDO term.
* For each experimental method:
	+ Create a new entry in the "Experiment Method" array.
	+ Fill out relevant fields (assay name, material used, readout type, result descriptions) with extracted information.
