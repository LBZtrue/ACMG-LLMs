To address the problem, I'll break down the solution into steps and provide a detailed answer.

**Step 1:** Extract all relevant variant information from the literature, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

For example, let's assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

We can use a bioinformatics tool or database like UniProt or Ensembl to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. For example, we can use the `hgvs` package in R to convert the preliminary HGVS nomenclature to its standardized form.

```r
library(hgvs)
hgvs_nomenclature <- "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A"
standardized_hgvs <- hgvs::HGVSstandardize(hgvs_nomenclature)
```

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

Let's assume the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

```r
library(mondoR)
disease_term <- mondo::get_mondo_term("Hereditary Myopathy")
```

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

Let's assume the literature mentions a Western Blot experiment using HEK293 cells with three biological replicates and technical triplicates.

```r
western_blot <- list(
  assay_method = "Western Blot",
  material_used = list(
    source = "Cell line",
    name = "HEK293",
    description = "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
  ),
  readout_type = "Quantitative",
  readout_description = list(
    variant = standardized_hgvs,
    conclusion = "Abnormal",
    molecular_effect = "partial loss-of-function",
    result_description = "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
  ),
  biological_replicates = list(
    replicates = "Yes",
    description = "Three biological replicates were performed."
  ),
  technical_replicates = list(
    replicates = "Yes",
    description = "Each sample was run in triplicate."
  ),
  basic_positive_control = list(
    control = "Yes",
    description = "Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control."
  ),
  basic_negative_control = list(
    control = "Yes",
    description = "Empty vector was used as a negative control."
  ),
  validation_controls_P_LP = list(
    controls = "Yes",
    counts = "2"
  ),
  validation_controls_B_LB = list(
    controls = "Yes",
    counts = "1"
  ),
  statistical_analysis_method = "ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.",
  threshold_for_normal_readout = "Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.",
  source = "Literature"
)
```

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease.

Let's assume that Western Blot is a common assay method for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

```r
approved_assay <- list(
  approved = "Yes",
  description = "Western Blot is commonly used for studying Hereditary Myopathy."
)
```

**Step 6:** Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here's an example of the final output in JSON format:
