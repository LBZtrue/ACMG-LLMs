Based on the provided specifications, I will outline the steps to follow for the task:

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Record this information in a temporary storage area, such as a spreadsheet or database.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use the standardized HGVS nomenclature guidelines to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature obtained from Step 1.
* Utilize a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl, NCBI) to obtain the standardized HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Determine the disease name mentioned in the literature as being studied.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term(s) associated with this disease using the MONDO database API or web interface.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Identify all experimental methods (e.g., Western Blot, RT-PCR) described in the literature.
* Extract detailed information for each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, biological replicates, technical replicates, basic positive controls, basic negative controls, statistical analysis methods, thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Consult external resources (e.g., scientific literature, databases) to determine if the experimental methods mentioned in the literature are commonly used for studying this particular disease.
* Record your findings as "Yes" or "No" based on your research.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Take the data obtained from Steps 1-5 and organize it into the desired format using a tool such as Python, JavaScript, or Excel.
* Ensure that all required fields (e.g., "Gene", "HGVS", "cDNA Change") are populated with accurate information.

Here's an example of what the completed JSON output might look like for Example 1:
