Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to complete the task:

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Extract gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (cDNA variation)
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position)

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use an API (e.g., NCBI's Variant Annotation Interface) to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Search for the disease name in the MONDO database
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term number

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Extract:
	+ Assay Method (Name of the experimental method)
	+ Material used (Source, Name, Description)
	+ Readout type (Quantitative or Qualitative)
	+ Readout description for each variant
	+ Biological replicates (Yes/No/N.D., Description)
	+ Technical replicates (Yes/No/N.D., Description)
	+ Basic positive control (Yes/No/N.D., Description)
	+ Basic negative control (Yes/No/N.D., Description)
	+ Validation controls P/LP (Yes/No/N.D., Counts)
	+ Validation controls B/LB (Yes/No/N.D., Counts)
	+ Statistical analysis method
	+ Threshold for normal readout (Threshold, Source)
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout (Threshold, Source)

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Check if the experimental protocol is commonly used in research for the specific disease

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Use the provided JSON framework as a template to organize the extracted data
* Fill in the relevant fields with the extracted data

Here is an example of what the output might look like:
