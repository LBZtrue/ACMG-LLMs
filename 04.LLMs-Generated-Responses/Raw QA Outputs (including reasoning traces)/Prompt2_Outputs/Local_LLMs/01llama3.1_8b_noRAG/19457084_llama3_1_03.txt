Based on the provided workflow and JSON framework, here's an example of how to organize the extracted information from a literature review into the predefined format:

**Step 1:** Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information.

Let's assume we have a literature review that mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." We also identify that the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

Using an API like Ensembl or RefSeq, we standardize the HGVS nomenclature to NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A for the variant in question.

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

As mentioned earlier, the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.

Let's assume there are two experimental methods mentioned in the literature: Western Blot and PCR. For each method, we extract the following information:

*   Assay Method: Name of the experimental method (e.g., Western Blot or PCR)
*   Material used:
    *   Material Source: Source of the material (e.g., Cell line or Patients Derived Material)
    *   Material Name: Name of the material in the literature
    *   Description: Original text from the literature describing the material
*   Readout type: Type of experimental result readout (e.g., Quantitative or Qualitative)
*   Readout description:
    *   Variant: HGVS nomenclature of the variant
    *   Conclusion: Conclusion of the experimental result (e.g., Abnormal or Normal)
    *   Molecular Effect: Molecular effect of the variant (e.g., complete loss-of-function, partial loss-of-function, etc.)
    *   Result Description: Specific description of the experimental result for each variant mentioned in the literature
*   Biological replicates:
    *   Whether biological replicate experiments were performed (Yes/No/N.D.)
    *   Description: Original text from the literature describing biological replicates
*   Technical replicates:
    *   Whether technical replicate experiments were performed (Yes/No/N.D.)
    *   Description: Original text from the literature describing technical replicates
*   Basic positive control:
    *   Whether a basic positive control was set up (Yes/No/N.D.)
    *   Description: Original text from the literature describing the positive control
*   Basic negative control:
    *   Whether a basic negative control was set up (Yes/No/N.D.)
    *   Description: Original text from the literature describing the negative control
*   Validation controls P/LP:
    *   Whether validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included (Yes/No/N.D.)
    *   Counts: Number of validation controls
*   Validation controls B/LB:
    *   Whether validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were included (Yes/No/N.D.)
    *   Counts: Number of validation controls
*   Statistical analysis method:
    *   Description of the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol
*   Threshold for normal readout:
    *   Threshold for normal results in the literature
    *   Source: Source of the threshold (e.g., Literature or Custom)
*   Threshold for abnormal readout:
    *   Threshold for abnormal results in the literature
    *   Source: Source of the threshold (e.g., Literature or Custom)
*   Approved assay:
    *   Whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease (Yes/No/N.D.)

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.

Based on our analysis, we determine that the Western Blot method is generally used for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6:** Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here's an example of how the extracted information would be organized in the predefined JSON format:
