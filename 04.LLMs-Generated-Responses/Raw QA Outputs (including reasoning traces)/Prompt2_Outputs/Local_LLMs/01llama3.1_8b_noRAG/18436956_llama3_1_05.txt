Based on the provided specifications, I will perform the following tasks:

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.
5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Please provide me with a sample literature text or a specific dataset containing the variant information, and I will perform these tasks accordingly.

Alternatively, you can provide me with a specific example from the provided examples (e.g., Example 1), and I will demonstrate how to extract and organize the data according to the specified JSON framework.
