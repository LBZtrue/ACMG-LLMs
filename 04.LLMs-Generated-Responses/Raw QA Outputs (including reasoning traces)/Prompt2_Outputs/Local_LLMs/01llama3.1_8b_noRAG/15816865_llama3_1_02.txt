Based on the provided specifications, I will provide a step-by-step guide to extracting and organizing the data from the literature.

**Step 1: Extract Relevant Variant Information**

From the literature, extract the following information for each variant:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position)

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of each variant. This will involve:

* Inputting the preliminary HGVS nomenclature into the API
* Retrieving the standardized HGVS nomenclature from the API

For example, using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) API, you would input a variant like "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" and receive a standardized output like "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A:p.G83D".

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

From the literature, identify the disease studied in the functional experiments. Then, use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding MONDO term number.

For example, if the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy", you would search for the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

From the literature, extract detailed information about each experimental method mentioned. This includes:

* Assay method
* Material used (source, name, description)
* Readout type
* Result descriptions for each variant mentioned

For example, if a Western Blot experiment was performed using HEK293 cells to study the effect of the TP53 variant c.248G>A, you would extract the following information:

* Assay method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result descriptions for each variant mentioned

**Step 5: Determine Experimental Protocol Approval**

Determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally approved for studying this disease. This can be done by checking the literature or consulting with experts in the field.

For example, if a Western Blot experiment using HEK293 cells to study the effect of the TP53 variant c.248G>A is commonly used in research on Hereditary Myopathy, you would indicate that it is an approved assay method.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted Information into JSON Framework**

Using the extracted information from steps 1-5, organize the data according to the predefined JSON framework provided.

Here is an example of what the final JSON output might look like:
