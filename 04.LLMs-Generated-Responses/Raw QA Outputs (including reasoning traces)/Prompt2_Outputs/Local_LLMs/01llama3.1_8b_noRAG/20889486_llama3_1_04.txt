I'll guide you through the process of extracting and organizing the information from the literature based on the provided workflow.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

Assume we have a literature that mentions the following variants:

* Gene: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature of the Variants via Relevant API**

Using a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl), we can standardize the HGVS nomenclature:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)

becomes

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.Glu83Asp)

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied in the Literature and Retrieve Corresponding Terms from MONDO Database**

The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term:

* MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List All Experimental Methods Mentioned in the Literature and Extract Detailed Information About Each Method**

Assume the literature mentions a Western Blot experiment:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description for each variant mentioned in the literature or listed in "Variants Include":
	+ NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.Glu83Asp)
		- Conclusion: Abnormal
		- Molecular effect: partial loss-of-function
		- Result description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods Are Generally Used for Studying the Disease**

Assume the literature mentions that the Western Blot experiment is a commonly used method for studying Hereditary Myopathy:

* Approved assay: Yes

Now, let's organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
