Based on the provided specification, I will guide you through the process of extracting and organizing information from the literature into the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. For example, assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API. For example, use the API to standardize the variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) as NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 3: Identify Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Term**

Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database. For example, assume the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

For example:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.

**Step 5: Determine Approved Assay**

Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease. For example, assume that Western Blot is an approved assay for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
