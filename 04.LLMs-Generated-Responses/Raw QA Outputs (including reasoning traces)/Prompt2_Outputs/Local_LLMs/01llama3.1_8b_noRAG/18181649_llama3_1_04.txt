To provide a solution to this complex problem, we will break it down into steps and address each component of the task.

**Step 1: Extracting Variant Information from Literature**

- The literature is read thoroughly to extract relevant information about variants.
- For each variant:
  - Gene name
  - Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
  - cDNA changes (transcript, ref, alt, position)
  - Protein changes (ref, alt, position)

**Step 2: Standardizing HGVS Nomenclature**

- Use a relevant API (such as the one provided by ClinVar) to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature extracted in Step 1.

**Step 3: Identifying Disease and Retrieving MONDO Terms**

- Identify the disease studied in the literature.
- Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term(s).

**Step 4: Extracting Experimental Method Information**

- List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
- For each method:
  - Assay name
  - Material source (cell line, animal model, patients-derived material)
  - Material name and description
  - Readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
  - Result descriptions for each variant mentioned

**Step 5: Organizing Information into JSON Format**

- Use the extracted information to populate the predefined JSON framework.

Given these steps and understanding of the task's requirements, we can proceed with organizing the extracted data according to the provided JSON template. However, without specific details from the literature about experimental methods for "Hereditary Myopathy" using Western Blot on HEK293 cells (the example provided), we'll fill in placeholders based on the typical structure and content as requested:

To complete the JSON framework, more specific details from a literature source (not provided) about experimental methods for studying "Hereditary Myopathy" using Western Blot on HEK293 cells should be integrated. This includes filling in the descriptions and settings for biological replicates, technical replicates, basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls P/LP, validation controls B/LB, statistical analysis method, threshold for normal readout, threshold for abnormal readout, and whether the assay is approved.
