Based on the provided workflow and JSON framework, I will guide you through extracting relevant information from a sample literature document and organizing it according to the predefined structure.

### Sample Literature Document:

The literature documents a study investigating the functional consequences of the TP53 gene variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) in the context of Hereditary Myopathy. The study employed Western Blot as an experimental method to assess protein expression levels.

**Key Findings and Experimental Details:**

1.  **Gene and Variant Information:** The study focuses on the TP53 gene, with a specific variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) being examined for its functional impact in Hereditary Myopathy.
2.  **Experimental Methods:** Western Blot was used to assess protein expression levels of the TP53 variant in comparison to wild-type controls.
3.  **Biological Replicates and Validation Controls:** Three biological replicates were performed, along with validation controls for pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (2) and benign/likely benign variants (1).
4.  **Statistical Analysis and Thresholds:** The study employed ANOVA for statistical analysis. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts were set at protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 and less than 50% on day 7, respectively.

### Organizing the Extracted Information:
