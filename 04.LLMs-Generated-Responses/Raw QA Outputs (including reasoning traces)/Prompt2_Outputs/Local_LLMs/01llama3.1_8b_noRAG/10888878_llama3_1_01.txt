Based on the provided workflow and JSON framework, I will outline a step-by-step approach to extract relevant information from the literature and organize it according to the predefined structure.

**Step 1: Extract Variant Information**

* Read through the literature and identify all variants mentioned.
* For each variant:
	+ Record the gene name
	+ Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
	+ cDNA changes (transcript, ref, alt, position)
	+ Protein changes (ref, alt, position)

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* Determine the disease studied in the literature.
* Search the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding term number (e.g., MONDO:0012345).

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each method:
	+ Record the assay method name
	+ Material used (source, name, description)
	+ Readout type and description
	+ Biological replicates (yes/no/N.D. with description)
	+ Technical replicates (yes/no/N.D. with description)
	+ Basic positive control (yes/no/N.D. with description)
	+ Basic negative control (yes/no/N.D. with description)
	+ Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (yes/no/N.D. with counts)
	+ Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants (yes/no/N.D. with counts)
	+ Statistical analysis method
	+ Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts (with source: Literature/Custom)
	+ Approved assay (yes/no/N.D.)

**Step 5: Organize Information in Predefined JSON Framework**

* Create a dictionary or object structure according to the predefined JSON framework.
* Populate each section with extracted information:
	+ "Variants Include"
	+ "Described Disease"
	+ "Experiment Method"

Here's an example of what the output might look like for the provided literature:

```
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {

                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            "Readout type": "Quantitative",
            "Readout description": [
                {
                    "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
                    "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
                    "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
                }
            ],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that this example is simplified and actual output may contain more details depending on the specific literature and experimental methods mentioned.
