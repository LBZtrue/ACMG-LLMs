Based on the provided specification, I will outline a step-by-step guide to generating the JSON output based on the given literature.

**Step 1: Read and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

Read the literature to identify all relevant variants mentioned. For each variant:

* Record the gene name (e.g., "TP53")
* Record the preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., "c.248G>A (p.G83D)")
* Identify cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number
	+ Reference nucleotide
	+ Alternative nucleotide
	+ Variant position
* Identify protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid
	+ Alternative amino acid
	+ Variant position

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

For each variant, standardize the HGVS nomenclature using a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl's REST API). Record the standardized HGVS nomenclature.

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

For each experimental method mentioned in the literature:

* Record the assay method (e.g., "Western Blot")
* Identify material sources:
	+ Material type (e.g., "Cell line")
	+ Material name
	+ Description of the material
* Identify readout types (e.g., "Quantitative") and descriptions
* Extract detailed information about each experimental replicate, including biological and technical replicates
* Identify control settings (positive and negative controls)
* Identify validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and benign/likely benign variants
* Record the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol

**Step 5: Determine Approved Assay**

Determine whether the experimental protocol used is generally approved for studying the disease mentioned.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted Information into JSON Framework**

Using the extracted information, organize it according to the predefined JSON framework, which includes:

* "Variants Include" section:
	+ Gene name
	+ Variants (including standardized HGVS nomenclature)
	+ cDNA changes and protein changes for each variant
	+ Description of the variant in the literature
* "Described Disease" section:
	+ Disease name studied in the functional experiments
	+ MONDO term corresponding to the disease
* "Experiment Method" section:
	+ Assay method
	+ Material used (including source, name, and description)
	+ Readout type and description
	+ Biological replicates
	+ Technical replicates
	+ Control settings (positive and negative controls)
	+ Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and benign/likely benign variants
	+ Statistical analysis method
	+ Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts (including source)

**Example Output**

Based on the provided example, here is a possible output in JSON format:
