I'll follow the specified workflow to provide a detailed answer.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.**

Assuming we have a text document containing the literature on a specific study. We need to extract the following information:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (cDNA variation)
* cDNA change details (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, variant position)
* Protein change details (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, variant position)

For example, let's say we extracted the following information from a text document:

* Gene: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Variant position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Variant position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.**

We can use a bioinformatics tool like HGVS to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. After running the variant through the tool, we get:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (standardized)

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.**

Assuming the study is about "Hereditary Myopathy," we can look up the corresponding MONDO term, which is:

* MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.**

For example, let's say the literature mentions two experimental methods:

1. Western Blot
2. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)

We need to extract the following information for each method:

* Assay Method name
* Material used:
	+ Material Source
	+ Material Name
	+ Description
* Readout type (Quantitative or Qualitative)
* Readout description (including HGVS nomenclature, conclusion, molecular effect, and result description)

For Western Blot:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

For PCR:

* Assay Method: PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: DNA template
	+ Material Name: Plasmid pGEM-T
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the plasmid pGEM-T as a DNA template.
* Readout type: Qualitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Normal
	+ Molecular Effect: No effect
	+ Result Description: The variant was amplified successfully.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.**

For Western Blot, we assume it is a commonly used method for studying Hereditary Myopathy:

* Approved assay: Yes

For PCR, we assume it may not be as commonly used for this specific study:

* Approved assay: No

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.**

Here's an example of how the JSON output would look like:
