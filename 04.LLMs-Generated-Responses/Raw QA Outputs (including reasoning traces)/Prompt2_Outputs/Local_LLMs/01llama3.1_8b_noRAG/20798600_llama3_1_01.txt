Based on the provided specifications, I will guide you through the process of extracting and standardizing information from a given literature.

**Step 1: Read the Literature**

The literature for this example is not provided. Please provide the specific article or text that contains the relevant information about the variants, disease, and experimental methods.

**Step 2: Extract Relevant Information**

From the provided text, extract the following information:

*   **Variants**: Identify the gene(s) involved, preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A), cDNA changes (transcript, ref, alt, position), and protein changes (ref, alt, position).
*   **Disease**: Determine the disease studied in the literature.
*   **Experimental Methods**: List all experimental methods mentioned, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

**Step 3: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants. This will ensure consistency in reporting variant information.

**Step 4: Retrieve MONDO Term**

Identify the corresponding MONDO term for the disease studied using the MONDO database.

**Step 5: Organize Information According to JSON Framework**

Using the extracted and standardized information, organize it according to the predefined JSON framework provided. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured in a structured format.

Here's an example of what the organized data might look like:

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            // ... (rest of the details)
        }
    ]
}
```

This organized data will match the predefined JSON framework, ensuring that all necessary information is captured in a structured format.

Please note that you need to replace the placeholder values with actual data extracted from the literature.
