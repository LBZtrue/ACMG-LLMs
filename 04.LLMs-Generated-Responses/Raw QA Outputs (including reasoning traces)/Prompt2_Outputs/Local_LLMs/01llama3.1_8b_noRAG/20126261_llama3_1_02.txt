Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Extract variant information**

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Variant position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Variant position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature**

Using the relevant API, I will standardize the HGVS nomenclature for the variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) as follows:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

The disease studied in the literature is Hereditary Myopathy, with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List experimental methods and extract detailed information**

Based on the literature, I will list the experimental methods mentioned as follows:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description for each variant (only one variant mentioned):
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Yes
	+ Counts: 2
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Yes
	+ Counts: 1
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7. (Source: Literature)
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Protein expression less than 50% on day 7. (Source: Literature)
* Approved assay:
	+ Yes

**Step 5: Organize extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

The final output in the predefined JSON format is as follows:
