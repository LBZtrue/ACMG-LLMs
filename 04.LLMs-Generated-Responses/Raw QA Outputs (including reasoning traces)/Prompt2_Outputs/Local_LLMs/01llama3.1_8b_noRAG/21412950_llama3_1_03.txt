Based on the provided specification, I will guide you through the process of extracting and standardizing data from the literature.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Information**

Read the given literature (in this case, a scientific paper) and identify all relevant information related to genetic variants, including:

* Gene names
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position)

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature via API**

Use a relevant API to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature. For example:

```python
import requests

# Preliminary HGVS nomenclature
hgvs_nomenclature = "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A"

# Standardization API endpoint (example)
standardization_api_endpoint = "https://example.com/standardize-hgvs"

# Send a GET request to the standardization API with the preliminary HGVS nomenclature as query parameter
response = requests.get(standardization_api_endpoint, params={"hgvs": hgvs_nomenclature})

# Extract the standardized HGVS nomenclature from the response
standardized_hgvs_nomenclature = response.json()["stdHGVs"]
```

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Term**

Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve its corresponding MONDO term:

```python
# Disease name (example)
disease_name = "Hereditary Myopathy"

# Send a GET request to the MONDO database with the disease name as query parameter
response = requests.get("https://mondo.io/api/term", params={"name": disease_name})

# Extract the MONDO term from the response
mondoterm_id = response.json()["id"]
```

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including:

* Material sources (cell line, animal model, patients-derived material)
* Readout types (qualitative or quantitative)
* Result descriptions for each variant
* Biological replicates (yes/no/ND)
* Technical replicates (yes/no/ND)
* Basic positive control (yes/no/ND)
* Basic negative control (yes/no/ND)
* Validation controls P/LP and B/LB (yes/no/ND, counts)
* Statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol
* Thresholds for normal and abnormal readout results

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods Are Generally Used for Studying the Disease**

Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease by checking if they match established protocols.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework, which includes:

* Variants Include (gene name, standardized HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes)
* Described Disease (disease name, MONDO term ID)
* Experiment Method (assay method, material used, readout type, result descriptions for each variant, etc.)

Here's an example of the organized JSON data:

```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "cDNA Change": {
            "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "A",
            "position": "248"
          },
          "Protein Change": {
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "D",
            "position": "83"
          },
          "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
  },
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      "Material used": {
        "Material Source": "Cell line",
        "Material Name": "HEK293",
        "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
      },
      // ... (rest of the information)
    }
  ]
}
```

This is a simplified example, and actual implementation may require more complex logic and error handling.
