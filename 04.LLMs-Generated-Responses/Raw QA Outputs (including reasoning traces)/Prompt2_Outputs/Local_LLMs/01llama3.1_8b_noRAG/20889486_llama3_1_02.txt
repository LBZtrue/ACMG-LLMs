Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to extract and organize the information from the literature into the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

* Identify all variants mentioned in the literature, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
* For each variant, record the original text describing its effect on the protein function.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature of Variants via Relevant API**

* Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Record the standardized HGVS nomenclature for each variant, along with its corresponding cDNA and protein changes.

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied in the Literature and Retrieve Corresponding MONDO Terms**

* Determine the disease studied in the literature by identifying relevant keywords or phrases that indicate the specific condition being investigated.
* Use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding term number for the identified disease.

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information from the Literature**

* Identify all experimental methods mentioned in the literature, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
* Record detailed information about each method, including original text describing its execution.

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods are Generally Used for Studying the Disease**

* Evaluate whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is commonly employed for studying the identified disease.
* Record a "Yes" or "No" value to indicate whether the experimental methods are generally accepted for this specific disease.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

* Use the standardized HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant to populate the corresponding fields in the "Variants Include" section.
* Populate the "Described Disease" section with the identified disease name and corresponding MONDO term number.
* Organize the extracted experimental method information into individual dictionaries within the "Experiment Method" list, ensuring that all required fields are populated.

**Example Output**

The provided example illustrates a possible output structure for the JSON framework. To create a complete example, I will fill in the missing values based on the specification:
