Based on the provided specification, I will guide you through the steps to complete the task.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

Assuming the literature is already read and analyzed, we can proceed with extracting the relevant variant information. Let's assume the extracted data for one variant is:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using a suitable HGVS nomenclature standardization API (e.g., HGVSc, HGVSp), we can convert the preliminary HGVS nomenclature to its standardized form. Let's assume the standardized HGVS nomenclature for this variant is:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

Let's assume the disease studied in the literature is "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

Assuming there are multiple experimental methods mentioned in the literature, we will focus on one example. Let's assume the first experimental method is a Western Blot experiment.

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

Assuming the Western Blot experiment is a commonly used method for studying Hereditary Myopathy, we can conclude that it is an approved assay for this disease.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Using the extracted data from the previous steps, we can now populate the JSON framework. Here's an example of what the completed JSON might look like:

This is just one example of how the JSON framework can be populated with data from a single variant and experimental method. Depending on the specific literature and experiments, the completed JSON may contain multiple variants, experimental methods, and other details.
