Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to complete the task:

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract relevant variant information**

* Identify the gene name and preliminary HGVS nomenclature for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Extract cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and variant position) and protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and variant position).
* Record a description of each variant in its original context.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API**

* Use the standardized framework to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
* Update the "HGVS" field with the standardized value.

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

* Identify the disease studied in the literature and record its name.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the database using the disease name.

**Step 4: Extract experimental method information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each method, extract:
	+ Material source (e.g., cell line, animal model, patients-derived material)
	+ Material name
	+ Description of the material used
	+ Readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
	+ Result description for each variant mentioned in the literature or listed in "Variants Include"
	+ Biological replicates (yes/no/ND) and description
	+ Technical replicates (yes/no/ND) and description
	+ Basic positive control (yes/no/ND) and description
	+ Basic negative control (yes/no/ND) and description
	+ Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (yes/no/ND) and count
	+ Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants (yes/no/ND) and count
	+ Statistical analysis method used
	+ Threshold for normal readout (if described in the literature) or a standard threshold based on knowledge
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout (if described in the literature) or a standard threshold based on knowledge

**Step 5: Determine approved assay**

* For each experimental method, determine whether it is generally used for studying the disease.
* Record "yes" or "no" or "ND" (not determined) as the value for the "Approved assay" field.

**Step 6: Organize extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Use the provided example structure as a guide to organize the extracted and standardized data into the required fields.
* Make sure to fill in all required fields with the relevant data.

Here's an example of what the completed JSON output might look like based on the provided literature:
