Based on the provided task, I will break down the solution into steps and provide a detailed answer.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Extract gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes from the literature.
* For example:
	+ Gene: TP53
	+ Preliminary HGVS: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
	+ cDNA Change: transcript = NM_001126112.3, ref = G, alt = A, position = 248
	+ Protein Change: ref = G, alt = D, position = 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use a reliable API (e.g., Ensembl) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature.
* For example:
	+ Preliminary HGVS: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
	+ Standardized HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Identify the disease mentioned in the literature.
* For example:
	+ Disease: Hereditary Myopathy
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term for the disease using the MONDO database.
* For example:
	+ MONDO Term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Identify the experimental methods used in the literature (e.g., Western Blot, PCR).
* Extract detailed information for each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
* For example:
	+ Assay Method: Western Blot
	+ Material used: Cell line (HEK293), Description = "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
	+ Readout type: Quantitative
	+ Readout description: Abnormal protein expression for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
	+ Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
	+ Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
	+ Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
	+ Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Assess whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is commonly employed for studying the disease.
* For example:
	+ Approved assay: Yes

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Structure the data into a JSON format, using the provided framework as a guide.

The final answer is:
