To solve this problem, we need to follow the given workflow and provide a detailed answer.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

Assuming the literature is provided, we will extract the following information:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (cDNA change)
* Protein change

For example, let's assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using a relevant API, such as Ensembl or HGVS, we will standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature:

* c.248G>A (p.G83D) -> NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy", with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

Assuming the literature mentions a Western Blot experiment, we will extract the following information:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description (for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A):
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

Assuming the Western Blot protocol is commonly used for studying Hereditary Myopathy, we will set "Approved assay" to Yes.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

The final output would be:
