I'll guide you through the process of extracting and organizing information from the given literature into the specified JSON format.

**Step 1: Extract relevant variant information**

From the provided example, we can see that there is a mention of a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

Extracted information:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide (ref): G
	+ Alternative nucleotide (alt): A
	+ Variant position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid (ref): G
	+ Alternative amino acid (alt): D
	+ Variant position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API**

Using the provided preliminary HGVS nomenclature, we can standardize it via the relevant API:

Standardized HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

The literature mentions "Hereditary Myopathy" as the disease studied.

Retrieved MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract experimental method details**

From the example, we can see that Western Blot was used as the experimental method. We need to extract detailed information about this method:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative

**Step 5: Extract result descriptions for each variant**

We need to extract result descriptions for each variant mentioned in the literature:

* For variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A:
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 6: Organize extracted and standardized information into JSON format**

Using the extracted and standardized information, we can organize it according to the predefined JSON framework:
