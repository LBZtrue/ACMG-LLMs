Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting relevant information from a scientific literature article.

**Step 1: Read the Literature**

Carefully read the scientific article to understand its content. Take note of:

* The gene(s) mentioned in the study
* The variants discussed (HGVS nomenclature)
* The experimental methods used (e.g., Western Blot, PCR)
* The disease studied

**Step 2: Extract Variant Information**

From the literature, extract information about each variant, including:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

**Step 3: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of each variant. This will provide a consistent format for reporting variants.

**Step 4: Identify the Disease Studied**

From the literature, identify the disease being studied and retrieve its corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

**Step 5: Extract Experimental Method Information**

For each experimental method mentioned in the literature:

* Identify the assay method (e.g., Western Blot)
* Note the material used, including source, name, and description
* Determine the readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
* Describe the result for each variant mentioned in the literature or listed in "Variants Include"
* Note any biological replicates performed
* Record technical replicate information
* Check if basic positive and negative controls were set up
* Identify validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic and benign/likely benign variants
* Document statistical analysis method used
* Determine thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts (or use standard values based on your knowledge)
* Indicate whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease

**Step 6: Organize Information According to JSON Framework**

Using the extracted information, organize it according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here's an example of how the output might look:

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            // ...
```

Please note that this is a complex task, and you may need to modify the process based on the specific requirements of your project. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions and follow any applicable guidelines when accessing scientific literature and databases.
