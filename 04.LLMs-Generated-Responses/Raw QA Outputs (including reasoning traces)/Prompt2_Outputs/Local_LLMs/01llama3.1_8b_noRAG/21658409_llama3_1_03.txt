I'll guide you through the process of extracting and organizing information from the literature into the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Extract Relevant Variant Information**

From the literature, extract all relevant variant information, including:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number
	+ Reference nucleotide
	+ Alternative nucleotide
	+ Variant position
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid
	+ Alternative amino acid
	+ Variant position

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

Using a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl's Variation API), standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature to obtain the final, standardized HGVS notation.

**Example:**

Original variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
Standardized HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G

**Step 3: Identify Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Term**

From the literature, identify the disease studied and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term.

**Example:**

Disease: Hereditary Myopathy
MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information**

List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including:

* Material sources (e.g., cell line, animal model, patients-derived material)
* Readout types (qualitative or quantitative)
* Result descriptions
* Biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed
	+ Description of biological replicates
* Technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed
	+ Description of technical replicates
* Basic positive control:
	+ Whether a basic positive control was set up
	+ Description of the positive control
* Basic negative control:
	+ Whether a basic negative control was set up
	+ Description of the negative control
* Validation controls P/LP and B/LB:
	+ Whether validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included
	+ Number of validation controls
	+ Whether validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were included
	+ Number of validation controls
* Statistical analysis method
* Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts (if not described in the literature, determine based on your own knowledge)

**Example:**

Assay Method: Western Blot

Material used:

* Material Source: Cell line
* Material Name: HEK293
* Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.

Readout type: Quantitative

Readout description:

* Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G
* Conclusion: Abnormal
* Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
* Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G.

**Step 5: Determine Approved Assay**

Determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease.

**Example:**

Approved assay: Yes

**Step 6: Organize Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Example:**
