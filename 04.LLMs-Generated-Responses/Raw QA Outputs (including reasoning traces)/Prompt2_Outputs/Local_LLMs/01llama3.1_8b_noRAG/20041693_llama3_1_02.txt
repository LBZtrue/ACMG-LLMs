Based on the provided specification, I will outline a step-by-step approach to extract and organize the required information from the literature:

**Step 1: Extract relevant variant information**

* Read the literature and identify all variants mentioned.
* For each variant:
	+ Extract the gene name.
	+ Record the preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A).
	+ Extract the cDNA change, including the transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position.
	+ Extract the protein change, including the reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API**

* Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl's VEP) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
* Record the standardized HGVS nomenclature in the "Variants Include" section of the JSON framework.

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

* Read the literature and identify the disease studied.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.
* Record the disease name and MONDO term in the "Described Disease" section of the JSON framework.

**Step 4: Extract experimental method details**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each experimental method:
	+ Extract the assay method (e.g., Western Blot).
	+ Extract material used, including source, name, and description.
	+ Determine the readout type (qualitative or quantitative).
	+ Extract biological replicates information, including whether experiments were performed and a brief description.
	+ Extract technical replicates information, including whether experiments were performed and a brief description.
	+ Determine if basic positive and negative controls were set up.
	+ Count validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and benign/likely benign variants.
	+ Record the statistical analysis method used.
	+ Determine thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts based on literature or custom standards.

**Step 5: Organize extracted information in JSON framework**

* Fill in the "Variants Include" section with standardized HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions from the literature.
* Fill in the "Described Disease" section with disease name and MONDO term.
* For each experimental method:
	+ Record assay method, material used, readout type, and result description (including all variants mentioned).
	+ Fill in biological replicates, technical replicates, basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls P/LP, validation controls B/LB, statistical analysis method, threshold for normal readout, threshold for abnormal readout, and approved assay information.
* Ensure that all extracted information is accurately recorded within the JSON framework.

**Example 1: Assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."**
