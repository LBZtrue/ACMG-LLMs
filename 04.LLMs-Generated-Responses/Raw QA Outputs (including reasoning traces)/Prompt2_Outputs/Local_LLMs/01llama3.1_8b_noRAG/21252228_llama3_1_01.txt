Based on the provided literature, I will extract and organize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Literature:** The paper discusses a study on the functional effects of a variant in the TP53 gene. The variant is described as c.248G>A (p.G83D) and is associated with hereditary myopathy. The disease studied is Hereditary Myopathy, and the corresponding MONDO term is "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 1-3: Extracting Variant Information, Standardizing HGVS Nomenclature, and Identifying Disease**

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

After standardizing the HGVS nomenclature via relevant API, the standardized HGVS is "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A".

The disease studied in the literature is Hereditary Myopathy, with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4-6: Extracting Experimental Method Information and Organizing**

* Assay method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:

| Variant | Conclusion | Molecular Effect | Result Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A | Abnormal | partial loss-of-function | Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A. |

* Biological replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Yes
	+ Counts: 2
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Yes
	+ Counts: 1
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Approved assay:
	+ Yes
