Based on the provided specification, I will guide you through a step-by-step process to extract and organize the information from the literature.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* For example, assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D).

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature of the Variants via Relevant API**

* Use an API to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
* For example, assume the standardized HGVS nomenclature for the TP53 variant is "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A".

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied in the Literature and Retrieve Corresponding MONDO Terms**

* Identify the disease studied in the literature.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

**Step 4: Extract Detailed Information about Each Experimental Method**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each method, extract detailed information such as material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods are Generally Used for Studying the Disease**

* Evaluate whether the experimental protocols used in the literature are generally accepted for studying the disease.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information According to Predefined JSON Framework**

* Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework provided in the specification.
* The resulting JSON structure should match the example provided in the specification.

Here's an example of how the final JSON output might look like:
