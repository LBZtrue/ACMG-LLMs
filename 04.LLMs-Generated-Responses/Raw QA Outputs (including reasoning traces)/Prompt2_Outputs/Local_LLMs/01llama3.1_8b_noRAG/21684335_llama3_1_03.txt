Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will outline the steps to follow for the given problem:

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information.
   - Extract gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
   - Use an API such as Ensembl or NCBI to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
   - Extract the name of the disease from the literature, then use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding MONDO term.

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.
   - For each experiment, extract:
     - Assay Method
     - Material used (including source, name, and description)
     - Readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
     - Result description for each variant (including conclusion, molecular effect, and specific details of the experimental result)

5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease.
   - Check if the assay method is commonly used to study the described disease.

6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.
   - Create a dictionary that contains:
     - "Variants Include": A list of dictionaries containing gene name, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and description in input context for each variant
     - "Described Disease": A dictionary with disease name and MONDO term number corresponding to the disease studied
     - "Experiment Method": A list of dictionaries containing assay method, material used, readout type, result description for each variant, biological replicates, technical replicates, basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls, statistical analysis method, threshold for normal readout, threshold for abnormal readout, and approved assay for each experiment
