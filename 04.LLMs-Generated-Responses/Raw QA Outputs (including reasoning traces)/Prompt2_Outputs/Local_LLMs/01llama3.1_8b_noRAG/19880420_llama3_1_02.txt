Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will outline the step-by-step process to extract and organize the relevant information from a scientific literature.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

* Identify all mentions of gene variants in the literature.
* For each variant, extract:
	+ Gene name
	+ Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
	+ cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position)
	+ Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position)

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature via Relevant API**

* Use a reputable API (e.g., NCBI's API) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
* Update the HGVS field in the "Variants Include" section with the standardized version.

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Terms**

* Determine the disease studied in the literature based on the experimental context.
* Look up the corresponding MONDO term(s) for the identified disease using a database (e.g., Monarch Initiative).

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

* For each experimental method mentioned, extract:
	+ Assay Method (name of the experimental method)
	+ Material used:
		- Source of material
		- Name of material in literature
		- Original text describing the material
	+ Readout type (quantitative or qualitative)
	+ Result description for each variant (including conclusions, molecular effects, and specific descriptions)

**Step 5: Organize Extracted Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

* Follow the predefined JSON framework to organize the extracted information:
	+ "Variants Include" section will contain the standardized HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and description for each variant.
	+ "Described Disease" section will contain the disease name and corresponding MONDO term(s).
	+ "Experiment Method" section will list each experimental method with detailed information (material used, readout type, result description).

**Step 6: Determine Approved Assay**

* Based on your expertise or literature review, determine whether the experimental protocol is generally accepted for studying the identified disease.

Here's an example of what the completed JSON framework might look like:

    ]
