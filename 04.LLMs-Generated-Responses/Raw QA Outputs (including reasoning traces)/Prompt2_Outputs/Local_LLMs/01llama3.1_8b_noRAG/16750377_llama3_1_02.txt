Based on the provided specification, I will guide you through the process of extracting and organizing information from a scientific literature piece into a predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

From the provided example, we can assume that the literature mentions variants in the TP53 gene. Extract the following information:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (cDNA variation): c.248G>A
* Protein change description (p.G83D)
* Description of the variant in the context: "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature via relevant API**

Using an HGVS API (e.g., [HGVS API](https://github.com/hgvs/api)), standardize the cDNA variation c.248G>A to obtain the correct HGVS nomenclature. For this example, assume that the standardized HGVS nomenclature is:

NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

From the provided example, we know that the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy." Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term by searching for "Hereditary Myopathy" on the [MONDO website](https://mondoimmunogenetics.org/). Assume that the corresponding MONDO term is:

MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

From the provided example, we can assume that a Western Blot assay was used to study the variant. Extract the following information for this experiment:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description (list of variants mentioned in the literature or listed in "Variants Include"):
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Whether a basic positive control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Whether a basic negative control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP (pathogenic/likely pathogenic):
	+ Whether validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included: Yes
	+ Counts: 2
* Validation controls B/LB (benign/likely benign):
	+ Whether validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were included: Yes
	+ Counts: 1
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Description of the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal results in the literature: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal results in the literature: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Approved assay:
	+ Whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease: Yes

**Step 5: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Using the extracted information, organize it into the predefined JSON framework as follows:
