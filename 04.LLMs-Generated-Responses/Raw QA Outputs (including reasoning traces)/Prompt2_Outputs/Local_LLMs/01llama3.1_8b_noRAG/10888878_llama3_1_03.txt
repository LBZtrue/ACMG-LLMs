Based on the provided specifications, I will outline the steps to complete the task:

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Extract the original text from the literature describing each variant.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant extracted in Step 1.
* Record the standardized HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Identify the disease name mentioned in the literature as the "Described Disease".
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term number for the identified disease using the MONDO database.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Extract the original text from the literature describing each experimental method.
* Identify the material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results for each experimental method.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Evaluate the experimental protocols mentioned in the literature to determine whether they are commonly used for studying the identified disease.
* Record the result as "Yes" if the protocol is approved, or "No" if it is not.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Use the extracted and standardized information from Steps 1-5 to populate the JSON framework.
* Ensure that all required fields are completed, including:
	+ "Variants Include": gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and description of each variant in the literature.
	+ "Described Disease": disease name studied in the functional experiments in the literature, and corresponding MONDO term number.
	+ "Experiment Method": assay method, material used (source, name, description), readout type, readout description (including HGVS nomenclature of each variant), biological replicates, technical replicates, basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and benign/likely benign variants, statistical analysis method, threshold for normal readout, threshold for abnormal readout, and approved assay.
