Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will attempt to answer the question.

**Question:** The literature mentions a study on the TP53 gene variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) in the context of Hereditary Myopathy. How would you extract and standardize the relevant information according to the predefined JSON framework?

**Answer:**

1. **Extract relevant variant information**: From the literature, we can extract the following information about the TP53 gene variant:
	* Gene name: TP53
	* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
	* cDNA changes:
		+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
		+ Reference nucleotide: G
		+ Alternative nucleotide: A
		+ Position: 248
	* Protein changes:
		+ Reference amino acid: G
		+ Alternative amino acid: D
		+ Position: 83
2. **Standardize HGVS nomenclature**: Using a relevant API, we can standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature as follows:
	* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
3. **Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**: From the literature, we can identify that the disease studied is Hereditary Myopathy. We can then retrieve the corresponding MONDO term (MONDO:0012345) from the MONDO database.
4. **Extract experimental method information**: From the literature, we can extract the following information about the Western Blot experiment:
	* Assay Method: Western Blot
	* Material used:
		+ Material Source: Cell line
		+ Material Name: HEK293
		+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
	* Readout type: Quantitative
5. **Organize extracted information according to JSON framework**: We can now organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
```json

    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {

    }
  ],

  },
  "Experiment Method": [

      "Material used": {
        "Material Source": "Cell line",

        "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
      },
      "Readout type": "Quantitative",
      "Readout description": [
        {
          "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
          "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
          "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```
