Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to extract and organize information from a literature example.

**Step 1: Read Literature and Extract Variant Information**

Assume we have a literature example that mentions a variant in the TP53 gene. The relevant text is:

"The TP53 gene was analyzed for variants. A c.248G>A (p.G83D) variant was identified, which causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

From this text, we can extract the following information:

* Gene: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA Change:
	+ Transcript: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein Change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

Using a relevant API (e.g., the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Variant Annotation Tool), we can standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature to obtain the final HGVS nomenclature:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Term**

From the literature example, it is clear that the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy." To retrieve the corresponding MONDO term, we can use the MONDO database:

* Disease name: Hereditary Myopathy
* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

From the literature example, it is mentioned that Western Blot was used to analyze the variant. The relevant text is:

"The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line. Protein expression was analyzed by Western Blot."

From this text, we can extract the following information:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative

**Step 5: Determine Experimental Replicates, Control Settings, and Statistical Analysis Method**

From the literature example, it is mentioned that:

* Biological replicates were performed (three biological replicates).
* Technical replicates were performed (each sample was run in triplicate).
* A basic positive control was set up (wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control).
* A basic negative control was set up (empty vector was used as a negative control).
* Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included (2 validation controls).
* Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information according to Predefined JSON Framework**

Using the extracted information, we can organize it according to the predefined JSON framework:
