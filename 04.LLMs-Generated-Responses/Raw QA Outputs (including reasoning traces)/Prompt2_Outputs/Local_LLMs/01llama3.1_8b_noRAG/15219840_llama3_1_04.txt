Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to follow in order to complete the task:

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

* Read the literature and identify all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
* Record this information in a table or spreadsheet for easy reference.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

* Use a relevant API (e.g. Ensembl, RefSeq) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants extracted in Step 1.
* Record the standardized HGVS nomenclature alongside the preliminary nomenclature for each variant.

**Step 3: Identify Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.
* Record this information in the JSON framework as described in the specification.

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
* Record this information in the JSON framework as described in the specification.

**Step 5: Determine Approved Assay**

* Determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying the disease studied.
* Record this information in the "Approved assay" field of the JSON framework.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

* Using the extracted and standardized information from Steps 1-5, organize it according to the predefined JSON framework provided in the specification.
* Ensure that all fields are filled with accurate and relevant information.

Here is an example of what the completed JSON framework might look like:
