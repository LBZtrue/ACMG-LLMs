Based on the provided workflow and JSON framework, I will outline the steps to extract and standardize information from the literature.

**Step 1: Read the Literature**

Assuming we have a document or article with relevant content about genetic variants and their effects. We will read through the text to identify specific information related to genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods.

**Step 2: Extract Relevant Variant Information**

From the literature, extract the following information for each variant:

* Gene name (e.g., TP53)
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes (e.g., transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (e.g., reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

**Step 3: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Using a relevant API or database (e.g., Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser), standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature for each variant. This will involve converting the cDNA changes to their corresponding protein changes.

**Step 4: Identify Disease Studied and Retrieve MONDO Terms**

From the literature, identify the disease studied and retrieve the corresponding MONDO terms from the database (e.g., "Hereditary Myopathy" with MONDO term "MONDO:0012345").

**Step 5: Extract Experimental Method Information**

For each experimental method mentioned in the literature:

* Identify the assay method (e.g., Western Blot)
* Extract material source, name, and description
* Determine readout type (qualitative or quantitative) and description
* Extract information about biological replicates, technical replicates, basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls, statistical analysis method, threshold for normal readout, and threshold for abnormal readout

**Step 6: Organize Information into JSON Framework**

Using the extracted and standardized information, organize it according to the predefined JSON framework. This will involve populating the "Variants Include," "Described Disease," and "Experiment Method" sections with relevant data.

Here is an example of what the final output might look like in JSON format:

  ]
}
```

Please note that this is just one possible implementation of the JSON framework, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements.
