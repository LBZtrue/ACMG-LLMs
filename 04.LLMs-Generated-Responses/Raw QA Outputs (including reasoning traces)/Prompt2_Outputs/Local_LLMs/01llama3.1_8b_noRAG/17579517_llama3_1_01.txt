To solve this problem, I will follow the given workflow and use the provided examples as a guide.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

The given examples do not provide specific text from the literature to extract. However, based on the provided JSON framework, we can infer that the task requires extracting gene names, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

For this step, I will assume a hypothetical API endpoint `https://api.hgvs.org/standardize` that takes the preliminary HGVS nomenclature as input and returns the standardized version. The standardized HGVS nomenclature for each variant can be retrieved from this API.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The examples provide specific disease names and corresponding MONDO terms. For instance, "Hereditary Myopathy" with the MONDO term "MONDO:0012345." In a real-world scenario, this step would require querying the MONDO database using the disease name to retrieve its corresponding MONDO term.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

This step requires manual analysis of the literature to identify the experimental methods used. The examples provide specific details for Western Blot, such as material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

This step requires knowledge of standard experimental protocols for each disease. For instance, Western Blot is commonly used to study protein expression in Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

The final output will be organized according to the provided JSON framework, which includes the "Variants Include" section with standardized HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant. The "Described Disease" section will contain the disease name and its corresponding MONDO term. The "Experiment Method" section will include detailed information about each experimental method.

Assuming the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

Here's an example JSON output based on this information:
