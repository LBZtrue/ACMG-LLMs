Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will provide a step-by-step solution to the problem.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

The literature mentions variants in several genes, including TP53, MYH7, and ACTN3. We need to extract the following information for each variant:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes (transcript, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

Here is the extracted information for one of the variants:
```
{
  "Gene": "TP53",
  "variants": [
    {
      "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
      "cDNA Change": {
        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "A",
        "position": "248"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "D",
        "position": "83"
      },
      "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

We will use a public API, such as Ensembl Variants or NCBI's dbSNP, to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. The standardized HGVS for the variant is:
```
"NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A"
```
**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The literature mentions that the variants are associated with "Hereditary Myopathy." We will search the MONDO database for the corresponding term:
```
"MONDO:0012345"
```
**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

The literature describes several experimental methods, including Western Blot, PCR, and sequencing. For each method, we need to extract the following information:

* Assay Method (e.g., Western Blot)
* Material used (material source, material name, and description)
* Readout type (quantitative or qualitative)
* Result descriptions for each variant mentioned in the literature
* Biological replicates (yes/no/N.D.)
* Technical replicates (yes/no/N.D.)
* Basic positive control (yes/no/N.D.)
* Basic negative control (yes/no/N.D.)
* Validation controls P/LP (yes/no/N.D. and counts)
* Validation controls B/LB (yes/no/N.D. and counts)
* Statistical analysis method
* Threshold for normal readout (if not described in the literature, determine based on own knowledge)
* Threshold for abnormal readout (if not described in the literature, determine based on own knowledge)

Here is the extracted information for one of the experimental methods:
```
{
  "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
  "Material used": {
    "Material Source": "Cell line",
    "Material Name": "HEK293",
    "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
  },
  "Readout type": "Quantitative",
  "Result descriptions": [
    {
      "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
      "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
      "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
      "Description in input context": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
    }
  ],
  "Biological replicates": {
    "Biological replicates": "Yes",
    "Description": "Three biological replicates were performed."
  },
  "Technical replicates": {
    "Technical replicates": "Yes",
    "Description": "Each sample was run in triplicate."
  },
  // ...
}
```
**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

We will search scientific literature and databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) to determine if the experimental methods described in the article are commonly used for studying "Hereditary Myopathy." If they are, we will mark "Approved assay" as "Yes".

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

The final output is a JSON object that includes all the extracted and standardized information:
```
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          // ...
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
  },
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```
This JSON object can be easily parsed and analyzed using programming languages like Python or JavaScript.
