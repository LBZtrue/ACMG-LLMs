Based on the provided workflow and JSON framework, I will extract relevant information from a sample literature and organize it according to the predefined structure.

**Sample Literature:**

The study investigates the effects of variants in the TP53 gene on protein function. The authors used Western Blot to analyze the expression of the variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) in HEK293 cells. Three biological replicates were performed, and each sample was run in triplicate.

**Extracted Information:**

1. Variants:
	* Gene: TP53
	* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
	* cDNA change: transcript = NM_001126112.3, ref = G, alt = A, position = 248
	* Protein change: ref = G, alt = D, position = 83
2. Disease studied: Hereditary Myopathy
3. Experimental methods:
	* Assay method: Western Blot
	* Material used:
		+ Material source: Cell line
		+ Material name: HEK293
		+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
	* Readout type: Quantitative
	* Result description for variant c.248G>A (p.G83D):
		+ Conclusion: Abnormal
		+ Molecular effect: partial loss-of-function
		+ Result description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
4. Experimental replicates:
	* Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
	* Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
5. Control settings:
	* Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
	* Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control.
