To answer this question, I will follow the given workflow to extract and standardize information from the literature.

**Step 1: Extract variant information**

From the literature, we can extract the following information about a variant in the TP53 gene:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature**

Using a relevant API, we can standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variant:

* Standardized HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

The literature mentions that the study is about "Hereditary Myopathy." We can retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the database:

* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract experimental method information**

From the literature, we can extract the following information about an experimental method (Western Blot):

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Whether a basic positive control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Whether a basic negative control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Whether validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included: Yes
	+ Counts: 2
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Whether validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were included: Yes
	+ Counts: 1
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Description of the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal results: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal results: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Approved assay:
	+ Whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease: Yes

**Step 5-6: Organize extracted and standardized information**

Finally, we can organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
