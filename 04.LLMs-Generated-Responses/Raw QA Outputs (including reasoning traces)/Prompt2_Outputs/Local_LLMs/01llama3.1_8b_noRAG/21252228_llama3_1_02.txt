Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will outline the steps to answer the question.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

Assuming the literature is a scientific article discussing the functional effects of genetic variants. The extracted information includes:

* Gene name (e.g., TP53)
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* Protein changes (e.g., p.G83D)

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using a reliable HGVS nomenclature standardization tool or API, the preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., c.248G>A) is standardized to the official HGVS format (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A).

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The literature mentions a study on "Hereditary Myopathy," which has a corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

Assuming there is only one experiment method mentioned, Western Blot:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

The literature mentions that Western Blot is a common method for detecting protein expression in cell lines, and it is indeed widely used for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Based on the extracted information, the final output would be:
