Based on the provided specifications, I will guide you through the steps to extract and standardize the information from the literature.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Variant Information**

Read the literature carefully and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. For example, if the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature of the Variants**

Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API. For example, if the preliminary HGVS nomenclature is c.248G>A (p.G83D), standardize it to NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A using an API.

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied in the Literature and Retrieve Corresponding MONDO Term**

Identify the disease studied in the literature, such as "Hereditary Myopathy". Then, retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database, which is "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods Mentioned in the Literature and Extract Detailed Information**

List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature, such as Western Blot. For each method, extract detailed information about material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods are Generally Used for Studying the Disease**

Determine whether the experimental methods mentioned in the literature are generally used for studying the disease. If they are, indicate "Yes" for "Approved assay", otherwise, indicate "No".

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information According to Predefined JSON Framework**

Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here is an example of how the output might look:
