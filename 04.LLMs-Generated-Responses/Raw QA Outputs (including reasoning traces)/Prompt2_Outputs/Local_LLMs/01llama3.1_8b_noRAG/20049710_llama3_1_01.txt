I will guide you through the workflow to extract and organize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

From the given example, we have a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

We will create an object with the following properties:

* Gene: TP53
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ cDNA Change:
		- Transcript: NM_001126112.3
		- Ref: G
		- Alt: A
		- Position: 248
	+ Protein Change:
		- Ref: G
		- Alt: D
		- Position: 83
	+ Description in input context: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using a HGVS API, we can standardize the HGVS nomenclature to:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

The standardized HGVS will replace the original one in the object.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

From the example, we know that the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

We will create an object with the following properties:

* Described Disease:
	+ Described Disease: Hereditary Myopathy
	+ MONDO: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

From the example, we have a Western Blot experiment.

We will create an object with the following properties:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative

**Step 5: Extract detailed information about each experimental method**

We will extract the following properties:

* Biological replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Yes
	+ Counts: 2
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Yes
	+ Counts: 1
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

The final JSON object will look like this:
