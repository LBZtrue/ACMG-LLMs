Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting relevant information from a given literature study.

**Step 1:** Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

For example, assume the literature mentions:

* A variant in the TP53 gene: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* The variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function.
* The disease studied is Hereditary Myopathy

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

Using an API like SnpEff or Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor, we can standardize the HGVS nomenclature as follows:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A → NM_001126112.3:c.248C>T (using SnpEff)

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

The described disease is Hereditary Myopathy, with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

For example:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248C>T (standardized HGVS nomenclature)
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248C>T.

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease.

Yes, Western Blot is a common assay method used to study Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6:** Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

The resulting JSON object would look like this:
