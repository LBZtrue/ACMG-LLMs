Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will provide a step-by-step solution to extract and organize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Extract gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Example:
	+ Gene: TP53
	+ Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
	+ cDNA Change: transcript = NM_001126112.3, ref = G, alt = A, position = 248
	+ Protein Change: ref = G, alt = D, position = 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl or UCSC) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
* Example:
	+ NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A → NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (standardized)

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Extract the disease name mentioned in the literature.
* Example: Hereditary Myopathy
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term for the disease using the MONDO database.
* Example: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Extract material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results for each experimental method.
* Example:
	+ Assay Method: Western Blot
	+ Material used: Cell line (HEK293)
	+ Readout type: Quantitative
	+ Readout description: [variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A]
	+ Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
	+ Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
	+ Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
	+ Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control.
	+ Validation controls P/LP: Yes, two validation controls were included.
	+ Validation controls B/LB: Yes, one validation control was included.
	+ Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
	+ Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 (literature).
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7 (literature).

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Extract information about the experimental method's use in studying the disease.
* Example:
	+ Approved assay: Yes

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Create a JSON object with the following structure:
