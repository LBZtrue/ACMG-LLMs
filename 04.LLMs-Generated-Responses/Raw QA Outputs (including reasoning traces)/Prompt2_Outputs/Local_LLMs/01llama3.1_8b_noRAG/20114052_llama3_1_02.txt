Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting information from a literature article and organizing it according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

Read the literature article carefully, noting down all relevant variant information. This includes:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature via Relevant API**

Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants. This will provide a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the variant.

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied in the Literature and Retrieve MONDO Terms**

Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding MONDO terms from the MONDO database.

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods Mentioned in the Literature and Extract Detailed Information**

List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature, and for each method:

* Note down the material source (e.g., cell line, animal model, patients-derived material)
* Identify the readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
* Record any result descriptions mentioned in the literature
* Determine whether biological replicates were performed
* Determine whether technical replicates were performed
* Check if a basic positive control was set up
* Check if a basic negative control was set up
* Note down any validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants
* Note down any validation controls for benign/likely benign variants
* Identify the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol
* Determine the threshold for normal readout (if not described, use standard knowledge)
* Determine the threshold for abnormal readout (if not described, use standard knowledge)

**Step 5: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information According to Predefined JSON Framework**

Using the extracted information from Steps 1-4, organize it according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here is an example of how the final output might look like for a literature article with the following information:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83
* Disease studied in the literature: Hereditary Myopathy
* MONDO term for the disease: MONDO:0012345
* Experimental methods mentioned in the literature:
	+ Western Blot
		- Material source: Cell line (HEK293)
		- Readout type: Quantitative
		- Result description for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A: Abnormal protein expression was observed.

The final output would look like this:
