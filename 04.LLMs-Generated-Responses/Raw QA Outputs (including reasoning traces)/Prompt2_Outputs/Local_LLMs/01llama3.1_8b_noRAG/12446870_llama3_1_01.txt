Based on the provided literature and the specified workflow, I will extract and standardize the relevant information to fill in the JSON framework.

**Step 1-3: Extracting variant information**

The literature mentions a single variant:

* Gene: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* Standardized HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 4-6: Identifying disease and extracting experimental method information**

The literature mentions the following disease:

* Disease name: Hereditary Myopathy
* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345 (retrieved from MONDO database)

Experimental methods mentioned in the literature include Western Blot.

Here is an example of the extracted and standardized information for one of the experimental methods:

**"Experiment Method" section**

* "Assay Method": Western Blot
* "Material used":
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* "Readout type": Quantitative
* "Readout description" for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A:
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Biological replicates**

* Biological replicates: Yes
* Description: Three biological replicates were performed.

**Technical replicates**

* Technical replicates: Yes
* Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.

**Basic positive control and Basic negative control**

* Both: Yes, with descriptions as per the literature.

**Validation controls P/LP and Validation controls B/LB**

* Both: Yes, with counts 2 for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and 1 for benign/likely benign variants.

**Statistical analysis method**

* ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.

**Thresholds for normal and abnormal readout**

* Normal readout threshold: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Abnormal readout threshold: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature

**Approved assay**

* Approved assay: Yes, as Western Blot is a standard protocol for studying protein expression in cell lines.
