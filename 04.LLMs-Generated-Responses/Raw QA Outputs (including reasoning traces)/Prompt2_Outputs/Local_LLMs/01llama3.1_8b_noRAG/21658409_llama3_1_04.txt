To address the problem presented, I will follow the detailed instructions and provide a solution based on the given requirements.

**Step 1: Reading the Literature**

The literature provided is a list of scientific articles related to genetic variants and their effects on disease. The task involves reading through these articles and extracting relevant information about each variant mentioned in the articles.

**Step 2: Extracting Variant Information**

From the literature, extract the following information for each variant:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

For example, the literature might mention a variant in the TP53 gene, described as "c.248G>A (p.G83D)". The extracted information would be:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 3: Standardizing HGVS Nomenclature**

Using a relevant API, standardize the HGVS nomenclature of each variant. For example, using the Ensembl API, we can standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A to its canonical form.

**Step 4: Identifying Disease Studied**

From the literature, identify the disease studied and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database. In this case, the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 5: Extracting Experimental Method Information**

For each experimental method mentioned in the literature:

* Extract the name of the assay (e.g., Western Blot)
* Identify the material used, including its source (e.g., cell line), name (e.g., HEK293), and description
* Determine the readout type (e.g., qualitative or quantitative)
* Extract detailed information about each variant mentioned in the literature, including:
	+ Conclusion of the experimental result (e.g., abnormal or normal)
	+ Molecular effect of the variant (e.g., complete loss-of-function or partial loss-of-function)
	+ Specific description of the experimental result for each variant
* Determine whether biological replicate experiments were performed and extract a description from the literature if available
* Determine whether technical replicate experiments were performed and extract a description from the literature if available
* Determine whether a basic positive control was set up and extract a description from the literature if available
* Determine whether a basic negative control was set up and extract a description from the literature if available
* Extract information about validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, including counts
* Extract information about validation controls for benign/likely benign variants, including counts
* Identify the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol

**Step 6: Organizing Information**

Using the extracted and standardized information, organize it according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here is an example of what the output might look like:
