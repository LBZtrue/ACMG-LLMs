Based on the provided text, it appears to be a scientific research article discussing various experiments and their results. The text describes several experiments involving different cell lines, including HEK293 cells, and their use in studying various biological processes.

To answer the question based on the provided workflow, I will follow these steps:

1. **Read the literature**: The given text is already read.
2. **Extract relevant variant information**: The text does not provide explicit variant information. However, it mentions several experiments involving different cell lines and their use in studying various biological processes.
3. **Standardize HGVS nomenclature**: Since no specific HGVS nomenclature is mentioned, this step cannot be performed without additional context or information about the variants studied in the article.
4. **Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**: The text does not explicitly mention a disease. However, it discusses experiments related to cellular processes, which could be relevant to various diseases.
5. **List experimental methods**: The text describes several experiments using Western Blot, but no specific experimental protocol is given for each method.
6. **Organize extracted and standardized information**: Based on the provided text, a possible organization of the information could be as follows:
