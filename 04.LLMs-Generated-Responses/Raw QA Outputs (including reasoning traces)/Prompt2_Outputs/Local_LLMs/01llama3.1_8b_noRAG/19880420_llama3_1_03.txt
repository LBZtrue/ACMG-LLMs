I'll guide you through the process of extracting and organizing information from the literature into a JSON framework as per your requirements.

**Step 1:** Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

Assuming you have already extracted this information from the literature, we can proceed to the next step.

**Step 2:** Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

We'll use a tool like SnpEff or Annovar to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. Let's assume we have obtained the standardized HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

```json
"Variants Include": [
  {
    "Gene": "TP53",
    "variants": [
      {
        "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
        "cDNA Change": {
          "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
          "ref": "G",
          "alt": "A",
          "position": "248"
        },
        "Protein Change": {
          "ref": "G",
          "alt": "D",
          "position": "83"
        },
        "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Step 3:** Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.

Let's assume we have identified the disease as "Hereditary Myopathy" with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

```json
"Described Disease": {
  "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
  "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
}
```

**Step 4:** List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

Let's assume we have extracted this information from the literature. We'll fill in the details for each experimental method.

```json
"Experiment Method": [
  {
    "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
    "Material used": {
      "Material Source": "Cell line",
      "Material Name": "HEK293",
      "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
    },
    "Readout type": "Quantitative",
    "Readout description": [
      {
        "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
        "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
        "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
        "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
      }
    ],
    "Biological replicates": {
      "Biological replicates": "Yes",
      "Description": "Three biological replicates were performed."
    },
    "Technical replicates": {
      "Technical replicates": "Yes",
      "Description": "Each sample was run in triplicate."
    },
    ...
  }
]
```

**Step 5:** Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.

Let's assume we have determined that the Western Blot method is an approved assay for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

```json
"Approved assay": {
  "Approved assay": "Yes"
}
```

The final JSON framework with all extracted and standardized information would be:

```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "cDNA Change": {
            "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "A",
            "position": "248"
          },
          "Protein Change": {
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "D",
            "position": "83"
          },
          "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
  },
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      "Material used": {
        "Material Source": "Cell line",
        "Material Name": "HEK293",
        "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
      },
      "Readout type": "Quantitative",
      "Readout description": [
        {
          "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
          "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
          "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
        }
      ],
      "Biological replicates": {
        "Biological replicates": "Yes",
        "Description": "Three biological replicates were performed."
      },
      "Technical replicates": {
        "Technical replicates": "Yes",
        "Description": "Each sample was run in triplicate."
      },
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

This is the final JSON framework with all extracted and standardized information.
