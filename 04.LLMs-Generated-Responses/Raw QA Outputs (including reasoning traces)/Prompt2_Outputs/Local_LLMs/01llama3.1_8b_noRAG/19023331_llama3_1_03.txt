Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting relevant information from a scientific literature and organizing it into a predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

Read the literature carefully and extract all relevant variant information, including:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

For example, let's assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D).

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via Relevant API**

Standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature using relevant APIs, such as Ensembl or RefSeq.

For example, the standardized HGVS nomenclature for the variant in the TP53 gene would be "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A".

**Step 3: Identify Disease Studied and Retrieve Corresponding MONDO Term**

Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

For example, if the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," the corresponding MONDO term would be "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including:

* Material sources
* Readout types (qualitative or quantitative)
* Result descriptions for each variant mentioned in the literature or listed in "Variants Include"
* Experimental replicates (biological and technical)
* Control settings (basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, and benign/likely benign variants)
* Statistical analysis methods
* Thresholds for normal and abnormal results

For example, let's assume the literature mentions a Western Blot experiment using the HEK293 cell line to study the variant in the TP53 gene.

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods Are Generally Used for Studying Disease**

Determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease. If so, indicate "Yes" in the "Approved assay" field; otherwise, indicate "No".

For example, if the Western Blot experiment using the HEK293 cell line is a commonly used method for studying TP53 variants related to Hereditary Myopathy, indicate "Yes" in the "Approved assay" field.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:
