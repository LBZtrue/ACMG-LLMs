Based on the provided guidelines, I will follow the workflow to organize the extracted and standardized information into a JSON format. Here's an example of how it can be done for the given literature:

**Step 1: Extract relevant variant information**

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA change:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Variant position: 248
* Protein change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Variant position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature via API**

* HGVS standardized nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (standardized via relevant API)

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term**

* Disease name studied in the literature: Hereditary Myopathy
* Corresponding MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract detailed information about each experimental method**

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source of material: Cell line
	+ Name of material: HEK293
	+ Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description for each variant mentioned in the literature or listed in 'Variants Include':
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result description: "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
* Biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: "Three biological replicates were performed."
* Technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: "Each sample was run in triplicate."
* Basic positive control:
	+ Whether a basic positive control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: "Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control."
* Basic negative control:
	+ Whether a basic negative control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: "Empty vector was used as a negative control."
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Whether validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included: Yes
	+ Number of validation controls: 2
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Whether validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were included: Yes
	+ Number of validation controls: 1
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Description of the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol: "ANOVA was used for statistical analysis."
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal results in the literature: "Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7."
	+ Source of threshold: Literature
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal results in the literature: "Protein expression less than 50% on day 7."
	+ Source of threshold: Literature
* Approved assay:
	+ Whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease: Yes

**Step 5-6: Organize extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Here's the resulting JSON:
