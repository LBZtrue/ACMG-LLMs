Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting relevant information from a literature study and organizing it into a predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

Let's assume we are working with a specific literature study that mentions variants in the TP53 gene. We need to extract the following information:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

For example, let's say we have a variant mentioned as "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" in the TP53 gene.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via Relevant API**

We will use an API to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature. For instance, using the Ensembl API, we can get the standardized HGVS nomenclature as "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A".

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

From the literature study, we identify the disease studied as "Hereditary Myopathy" and retrieve its corresponding MONDO term, which is "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

We list all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including:

* Assay Method
* Material used (Source, Name, Description)
* Readout type (Quantitative or Qualitative)
* Result description for each variant (Conclusion, Molecular Effect, and Specific Description)

For example, let's say we have an experimental method mentioned as "Western Blot" with the following details:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description for each variant (Conclusion, Molecular Effect, and Specific Description)

**Step 5: Determine Whether Experimental Methods are Generally Used for Studying Disease**

Based on our knowledge or literature, we determine whether the experimental methods used in the study are generally used for studying the disease. In this case, let's assume that Western Blot is indeed an approved assay for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6: Organize Extracted and Standardized Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

We organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
