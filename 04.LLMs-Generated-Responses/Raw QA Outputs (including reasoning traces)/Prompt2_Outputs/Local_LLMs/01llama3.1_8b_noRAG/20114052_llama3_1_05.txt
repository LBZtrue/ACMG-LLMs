I'll guide you through the task step-by-step to extract and organize data according to the provided JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

Please provide the specific texts from the literature that mention variants, diseases, experimental methods, and results. With this information, I can proceed with extracting the relevant details for each section of the JSON framework.

For example, if you have provided the following text:

"The TP53 gene contains a variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) associated with Hereditary Myopathy (MONDO:0012345). The experimental method used was Western Blot to analyze protein expression in HEK293 cells."

I can proceed as follows:

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

For the provided variant "c.248G>A" in the TP53 gene, I would use an API such as Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) or the UCSC Genome Browser's Variant Annotation Interface (VAI) to standardize its HGVS notation and extract cDNA and protein change information.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

Using the provided text, I would identify Hereditary Myopathy as the disease studied. Then, I would look up the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345" for this disease.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

From the provided text, I can see that Western Blot is an example of an experimental method used. I will continue to extract details about this method as per the JSON framework.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

For Hereditary Myopathy, I would check if Western Blot is a commonly used or recommended assay method in research papers and studies related to this disease.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Once all necessary information has been collected, I can organize it into the specified JSON structure as shown in Example 1.

Let's proceed with extracting data from your specific texts. Please provide the relevant literature excerpts for me to work on.
