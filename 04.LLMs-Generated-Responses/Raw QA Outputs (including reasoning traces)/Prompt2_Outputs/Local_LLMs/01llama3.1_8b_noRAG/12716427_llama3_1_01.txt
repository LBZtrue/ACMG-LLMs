Based on the provided specification, I will create a step-by-step guide to extract and organize the information from the literature into the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature**

Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via a relevant API.

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the database.

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Methods**

List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including:

* Material sources
* Readout types
* Result descriptions
* Experimental replicates (biological and technical)
* Control settings (positive and negative controls)
* Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants
* Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants
* Statistical analysis methods used
* Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts

**Step 5: Organize Extracted Information**

Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here is an example of how the final output would look like:
