To solve this problem, I will follow the workflow outlined in the specification. Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

Based on the example provided, let's assume we have a document with the following text:
"The TP53 gene has a variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) that causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

We can extract the following information:

* Gene: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* cDNA Change:
	+ Transcript: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein Change:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

We can use a bioinformatics API, such as Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser, to standardize the HGVS nomenclature.

For example, we can use the Ensembl API to get the standardized HGVS nomenclature:
```
curl -X GET \
  https://rest.ensembl.org/variation/human/NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This will return the standardized HGVS nomenclature, which we can use in our output.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

Based on the example provided, let's assume the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy". We can look up the corresponding MONDO term using a bioinformatics API or a web interface.

For example, we can use the MONDO API to get the MONDO term for "Hereditary Myopathy":
```
curl -X GET \
  https://mondo.ontobee.org/ontology/MONDO#0012345 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This will return the MONDO term, which we can use in our output.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

Based on the example provided, let's assume there is only one experimental method mentioned: Western Blot.

We can extract the following information:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source: Cell line
	+ Name: HEK293
	+ Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result description: "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

We can assume that Western Blot is a commonly used method for studying Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Here's the final output in JSON format:
