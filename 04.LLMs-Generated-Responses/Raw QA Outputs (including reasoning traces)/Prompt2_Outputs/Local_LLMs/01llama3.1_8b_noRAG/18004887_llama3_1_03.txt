Based on the provided workflow and JSON framework, I will outline the steps to extract and organize the information from the literature:

**Step 1: Extract variant information**

From the literature, extract the following information for each variant:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number
	+ Reference nucleotide
	+ Alternative nucleotide
	+ Variant position
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid
	+ Alternative amino acid
	+ Variant position

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature**

Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of each variant. This will involve submitting the preliminary HGVS nomenclature and receiving the standardized version in return.

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

From the literature, identify the disease studied and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

**Step 4: Extract experimental method information**

For each experimental method mentioned in the literature:

* Extract the name of the assay method (e.g., Western Blot)
* Extract material source, name, and description
* Determine readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
* Extract result descriptions for each variant mentioned in the literature or listed in 'Variants Include'
* Extract information on biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed
	+ Original text describing biological replicates
* Extract information on technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed
	+ Original text describing technical replicates
* Extract information on basic positive and negative controls:
	+ Whether a basic positive or negative control was set up
	+ Original text describing the control
* Extract validation control information for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and benign/likely benign variants:
	+ Whether validation controls were included
	+ Number of validation controls
* Extract statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol
* Determine threshold for normal readout (if not described in literature, use standard knowledge)
* Determine threshold for abnormal readout (if not described in literature, use standard knowledge)
* Determine whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease

**Step 5: Organize extracted information**

Using the predefined JSON framework, organize the extracted and standardized information according to the following structure:

```json

    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",

                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",

                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            "Readout type": "Quantitative",
            "Readout description": [
                {
                    "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
                    "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
                    "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
                }
            ],
            // ... (other fields)
        }
    ]
}
```

This will result in a JSON object that contains all the extracted and standardized information, organized according to the predefined framework.

Please note that this is just an outline of the steps, and you may need to modify it based on the specific requirements of your task. Additionally, you should ensure that the API used for standardizing HGVS nomenclature is accurate and reliable.
