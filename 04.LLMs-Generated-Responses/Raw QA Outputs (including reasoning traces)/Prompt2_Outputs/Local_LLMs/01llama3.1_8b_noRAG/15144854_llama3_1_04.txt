Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to solve this problem.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Create a list of variants with their corresponding information.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

* Use an API (e.g., Ensembl or RefSeq) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
* Update the list of variants with their standardized HGVS nomenclature.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

* Determine the disease name studied in the functional experiments mentioned in the literature.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term number for the identified disease.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

* Identify the experimental methods (e.g., Western Blot, qRT-PCR) used in the literature.
* Extract detailed information about each method, including:
	+ Material sources
	+ Readout types
	+ Result descriptions
	+ Experimental replicates (biological and technical)
	+ Control settings (positive and negative controls)
	+ Statistical analysis methods
	+ Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Review the literature to determine if the experimental protocol used is commonly accepted for studying the identified disease.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Use the JSON framework provided in the specification to organize the extracted and standardized information.
* Create a JSON object that includes the variants, disease, and experimental methods with their corresponding details.

Here is an example of how the final output might look like:

```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "cDNA Change": {
            "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "A",
            "position": "248"
          },
          "Protein Change": {
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "D",
            "position": "83"
          },
          "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
  },
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      "Material used": {
        "Material Source": "Cell line",
        "Material Name": "HEK293",
        "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
      },
      "Readout type": "Quantitative",
      "Readout description": [
        {
          "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
          "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
          "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
        }
      ],
      // ... other details
    }
  ]
}
```

This output includes the standardized HGVS nomenclature for each variant, the disease name with its corresponding MONDO term number, and detailed information about each experimental method used in the literature.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may require additional steps or modifications to fit your specific needs.
