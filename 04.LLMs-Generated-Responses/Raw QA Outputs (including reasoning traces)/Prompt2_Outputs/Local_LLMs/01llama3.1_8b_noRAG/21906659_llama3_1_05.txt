Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting relevant information from a literature text and organizing it into the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

* Identify the gene name associated with the variant(s).
* Note down the preliminary HGVS nomenclature mentioned in the literature.
* Extract cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position) for each variant.
* Document protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position) for each variant.

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS Nomenclature of Variants via Relevant API**

* Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl's VEP or SnpEff) to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature.
* Replace the preliminary nomenclature with the standardized one in the extracted information.

**Step 3: Identify the Disease Studied and Retrieve Corresponding MONDO Terms**

* Determine the disease name mentioned in the literature as the disease being studied.
* Look up the corresponding MONDO term for this disease by searching the MONDO database using the disease name.

**Step 4: List All Experimental Methods Mentioned in the Literature**

* Identify each experimental method used in the study (e.g., Western Blot, PCR).
* For each method, extract detailed information such as material sources, readout types, result descriptions, and control settings.

**Step 5: Organize Extracted Information into Predefined JSON Framework**

* Use the extracted variant information to populate the "Variants Include" section of the predefined JSON framework.
* Populate the "Described Disease" section with the disease name and corresponding MONDO term.
* For each experimental method, create a new entry in the "Experiment Method" array. Fill in relevant details such as assay method, material used, readout type, readout description (including variant HGVS nomenclature), biological replicates, technical replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

**Example 1:**

Let's assume the literature text is:

* Gene: TP53
* Variants: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* Disease: Hereditary Myopathy
* Experimental Methods:
	+ Western Blot with HEK293 cell line
	+ PCR with wild-type and variant cDNA

**JSON Output:**

}

This is a basic example of how the information would be extracted and organized into the predefined JSON framework. Note that this is a simplified version, and actual output may vary depending on the specific requirements and complexity of the literature text.
