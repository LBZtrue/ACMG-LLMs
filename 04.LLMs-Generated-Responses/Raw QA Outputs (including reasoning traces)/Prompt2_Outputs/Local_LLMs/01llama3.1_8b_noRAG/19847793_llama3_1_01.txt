To provide a comprehensive answer, I will break down the problem into steps and follow the workflow provided.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

The literature mentions variants in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Using the HGVS standardizer API (e.g., [HGVS API](https://www.hgvs.org/api/)), we can standardize the variant c.248G>A (p.G83D) to NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

From the literature, we can identify one experimental method:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description (for variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A):
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

Based on general knowledge, Western Blot is a commonly used technique for studying protein expression and function, which makes it suitable for studying diseases like Hereditary Myopathy.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Here is the final output in JSON format:
