Based on the provided specifications, I will implement a Python solution to extract and standardize information from the literature.

```python
import json

def standardize_hgvs(variant):
    # Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API (for simplicity, assume we have a function called `standardize_hgvs_api`)
    return standardize_hgvs_api(variant)

def extract_info_from_literature(literature_text):
    # Extract relevant information from the literature text
    variants = []
    for line in literature_text.splitlines():
        if "cDNA change" in line:
            transcript, ref, alt, position = line.split(":")[1].split(",")
            variant = {
                "HGVS": f"{transcript}:{ref}>{alt}",
                "cDNA Change": {
                    "transcript": transcript,
                    "ref": ref,
                    "alt": alt,
                    "position": position
                },
                "Protein Change": {
                    # For simplicity, assume we have a function called `translate_cdna_to_protein` to translate cDNA changes to protein changes
                    "ref": translate_cdna_to_protein(ref),
                    "alt": translate_cdna_to_protein(alt),
                    "position": position
                },
                "Description in input context": line.strip()
            }
            variants.append(variant)
    return variants

def extract_disease_info(literature_text):
    # Extract disease information from the literature text
    for line in literature_text.splitlines():
        if "Hereditary Myopathy" in line:
            disease = {
                "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
                "MONDO": f"MONDO:0012345"
            }
            return disease

def extract_experiment_info(literature_text):
    # Extract experimental method information from the literature text
    experiments = []
    for line in literature_text.splitlines():
        if "Western Blot" in line:
            experiment = {
                "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
                "Material used": {
                    "Material Source": "Cell line",
                    "Material Name": "HEK293",
                    "Description": line.strip()
                },
                "Readout type": "Quantitative"
            }
            experiments.append(experiment)
    return experiments

def main():
    literature_text = """cDNA change: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
Hereditary Myopathy was studied in the functional experiments.
The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
Western Blot was used to detect protein expression.
Three biological replicates were performed.
Each sample was run in triplicate.
Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
Empty vector was used as a negative control.
ANOVA was used for statistical analysis."""

    variants = extract_info_from_literature(literature_text)
    standardized_variants = [standardize_hgvs(variant) for variant in variants]

    disease_info = extract_disease_info(literature_text)

    experiments = extract_experiment_info(literature_text)

    json_output = {
        "Variants Include": [{"Gene": "TP53", "variants": standardized_variants}],
        "Described Disease": disease_info,
        "Experiment Method": experiments
    }

    with open("output.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(json_output, f, indent=4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script assumes that the `standardize_hgvs_api` function is implemented elsewhere and available for use. The `translate_cdna_to_protein` function is also assumed to be implemented elsewhere.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation, and actual code may need to handle more complex scenarios, such as multiple variants per gene or multiple experimental methods.
