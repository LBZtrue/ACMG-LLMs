Based on the provided framework and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting and standardizing information from a given literature and organizing it according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the Literature and Extract Relevant Variant Information**

Assume we have a literature that discusses a variant in the TP53 gene. The literature mentions the following:

* Gene: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Variant position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Variant position: 83

The literature also describes the variant as causing a structural change in the protein, affecting its function.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature via API**

Using a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl), standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature:

* NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A → NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (no change, as this is already in the correct format)

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

The literature mentions the disease studied as "Hereditary Myopathy." Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term:

* MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: List Experimental Methods and Extract Detailed Information**

Assume there are two experimental methods mentioned in the literature: Western Blot and Quantitative PCR.

For each method, extract the following information:

1. Assay Method
2. Material used:
	+ Material Source
	+ Material Name
	+ Description
3. Readout type (Quantitative or Qualitative)
4. Result description for each variant mentioned in the literature or listed in 'Variants Include'
5. Biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed (Yes/No/N.D.)
	+ Description of biological replicates
6. Technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed (Yes/No/N.D.)
	+ Description of technical replicates
7. Basic positive control:
	+ Whether a basic positive control was set up (Yes/No/N.D.)
	+ Description of the positive control
8. Basic negative control:
	+ Whether a basic negative control was set up (Yes/No/N.D.)
	+ Description of the negative control
9. Validation controls P/LP and B/LB:
	+ Whether validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included (Yes/No/N.D.)
	+ Counts of validation controls
10. Statistical analysis method:
	+ Description of the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol
11. Threshold for normal readout and abnormal readout:
	+ Thresholds for normal and abnormal results
	+ Source of thresholds (Literature or Custom)
12. Approved assay:
	+ Whether the experimental protocol used is generally used for studying this disease (Yes/No/N.D.)

**Step 5: Organize Extracted Information according to Predefined JSON Framework**

Using the extracted information, organize it according to the predefined JSON framework:
