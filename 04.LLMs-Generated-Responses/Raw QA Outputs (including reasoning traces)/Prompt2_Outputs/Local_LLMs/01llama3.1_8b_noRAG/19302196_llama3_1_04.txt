Based on the provided specifications, I will outline the steps to follow for this task:

**Step 1: Read and Extract Relevant Information**

* Read the literature carefully and extract all relevant information about the variants mentioned in the article.
* Identify the gene names, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions of each variant.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant extracted in Step 1.
* Record the standardized HGVS nomenclature in the "Variants Include" section of the JSON framework.

**Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term**

* Read the literature again and identify the disease studied in the functional experiments.
* Use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding term for the identified disease.
* Record the disease name and its corresponding MONDO term in the "Described Disease" section of the JSON framework.

**Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Details**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including:
	+ Assay method
	+ Material used (source, name, description)
	+ Readout type (quantitative or qualitative)
	+ Result descriptions for each variant mentioned in the article
	+ Biological replicates (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Technical replicates (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Basic positive control (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Basic negative control (yes/no/N.D.)
	+ Validation controls P/LP (yes/no/N.D., counts)
	+ Validation controls B/LB (yes/no/N.D., counts)
	+ Statistical analysis method
	+ Threshold for normal readout (description, source)
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout (description, source)

**Step 5: Determine Approved Assay**

* Review the experimental protocol used in the literature and determine whether it is generally used for studying this disease.
* Record "Yes" or "No" in the "Approved assay" section of the JSON framework.

**Step 6: Organize Information into JSON Framework**

* Arrange the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework provided in the specifications.

By following these steps, you should be able to create a complete and accurate JSON output based on the literature review.
