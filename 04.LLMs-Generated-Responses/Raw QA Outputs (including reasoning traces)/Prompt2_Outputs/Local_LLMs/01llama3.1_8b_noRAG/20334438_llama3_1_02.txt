I'll guide you through the process of extracting and organizing information from the literature according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Extract relevant variant information**

From the literature, extract the following information for each variant:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

Let's assume we have extracted the following information for a variant in the TP53 gene:

* Gene: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature**

Use the relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant. Let's assume we use the Ensembl API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature:

* Standardized HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

From the literature, identify the disease studied and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.

Let's assume we have identified the following information:

* Disease: Hereditary Myopathy
* MONDO term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract experimental method information**

From the literature, extract detailed information about each experimental method, including:

* Assay method (e.g., Western Blot)
* Material used:
	+ Source of material (e.g., cell line, animal model, or patients-derived material)
	+ Name of material
	+ Description of material
* Readout type (qualitative or quantitative)
* Result description for each variant mentioned in the literature

Let's assume we have extracted the following information for a Western Blot experiment:

* Assay method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Source of material: Cell line
	+ Name of material: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Result description for each variant mentioned in the literature:

| Variant | Conclusion | Molecular Effect | Result Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A | Abnormal | partial loss-of-function | Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A. |

**Step 5: Determine approved assay**

Determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease.

Let's assume we have determined that the Western Blot experiment is an approved assay for studying Hereditary Myopathy:

* Approved assay: Yes

Now, let's organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
