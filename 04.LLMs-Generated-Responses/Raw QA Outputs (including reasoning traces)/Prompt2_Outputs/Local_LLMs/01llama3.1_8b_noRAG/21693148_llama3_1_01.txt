Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the process of extracting and standardizing information from a given literature to fit the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

Read the provided literature and identify the relevant sections containing variant information. For this example, assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D).

Extract the following information:

* Gene name: TP53
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
* cDNA changes:
	+ Transcript number: NM_001126112.3
	+ Reference nucleotide: G
	+ Alternative nucleotide: A
	+ Variant position: 248
* Protein changes:
	+ Reference amino acid: G
	+ Alternative amino acid: D
	+ Variant position: 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Use a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. For this example, assume the standardized HGVS nomenclature is NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

Identify the disease mentioned in the literature as "Hereditary Myopathy." Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term number, which is MONDO:0012345.

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

Read the literature to identify the experimental methods used. For this example, assume a Western Blot was performed using the HEK293 cell line.

Extract the following information for each experimental method:

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description (for each variant mentioned in the literature):
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Whether biological replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Whether technical replicate experiments were performed: Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Whether a basic positive control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Whether a basic negative control was set up: Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP (for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants):
	+ Whether validation controls were included: Yes
	+ Counts: 2
* Validation controls B/LB (for benign/likely benign variants):
	+ Whether validation controls were included: Yes
	+ Counts: 1
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Description of the statistical analysis method used: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal results: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal results: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
	+ Source: Literature
* Approved assay:
	+ Whether the experimental protocol used is generally used for studying this disease: Yes

**Step 5: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Using the extracted and standardized information, organize it into the predefined JSON framework as follows:

                }
            ],
            ...

This JSON object now contains the extracted and standardized information, following the predefined framework.

**Note:** This example is a simplified illustration of the process. In practice, you may need to handle more complex scenarios, such as dealing with multiple variants, experimental methods, or disease descriptions. Additionally, ensure that you are using the correct APIs for standardizing HGVS nomenclature and retrieving MONDO terms.
