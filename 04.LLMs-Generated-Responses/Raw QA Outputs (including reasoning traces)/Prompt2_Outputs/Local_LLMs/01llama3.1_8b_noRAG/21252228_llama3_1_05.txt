Based on the provided specification, I will outline a step-by-step approach to solve this task:

**Step 1: Read and extract relevant variant information**

*   Read the literature carefully to identify all variants mentioned.
*   Extract the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature (in the format "transcript number:cDNA variation"), cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant.

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant API**

*   Use a standardized API (e.g., Ensembl API) to convert the preliminary HGVS nomenclature into a standardized format.
*   Note that this step requires access to a reliable and up-to-date database of genomic information.

**Step 3: Identify disease studied in literature and retrieve corresponding MONDO term**

*   Carefully read the literature to identify the specific disease being studied.
*   Use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding term for the identified disease.
*   Note that this step requires access to a reliable and up-to-date version of the MONDO database.

**Step 4: List experimental methods mentioned in literature and extract detailed information**

*   Carefully read the literature to identify all experimental methods used (e.g., Western Blot, PCR).
*   Extract detailed information about each method, including:
    *   Material source (e.g., cell line, animal model)
    *   Material name
    *   Description of material
    *   Readout type (quantitative or qualitative)
    *   Result description for each variant mentioned in the literature
    *   Experimental replicates (biological and technical)
    *   Control settings (positive and negative controls)
    *   Statistical analysis method used

**Step 5: Determine whether experimental methods are generally used for studying disease**

*   Based on general knowledge of the field, determine whether the experimental methods used in the literature are commonly employed to study the identified disease.

**Step 6: Organize extracted information according to predefined JSON framework**

*   Use a programming language (e.g., Python) to create a data structure that matches the predefined JSON format.
*   Populate the data structure with the extracted and standardized information for each variant and experimental method.

Here's an example of what the output might look like in JSON format, based on the provided specification:

```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "TP53",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "cDNA Change": {
            "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "A",
            "position": "248"
          },
          "Protein Change": {
            "ref": "G",
            "alt": "D",
            "position": "83"
          },
          "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
  },
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
      "Material used": {
        "Material Source": "Cell line",
        "Material Name": "HEK293",
        "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
      },
      "Readout type": "Quantitative",
      "Readout description": [
        {
          "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
          "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
          "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

This is a simplified example of what the output might look like. The actual JSON structure will depend on the specific requirements and details of each variant and experimental method mentioned in the literature.
