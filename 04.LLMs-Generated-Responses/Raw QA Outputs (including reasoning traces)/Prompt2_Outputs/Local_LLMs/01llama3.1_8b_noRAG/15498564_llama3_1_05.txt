Based on the provided workflow and JSON framework, I will guide you through extracting information from a sample literature text. We'll use an example where the literature discusses a study on a variant in the TP53 gene.

**Sample Literature Text**

The study investigated the effects of the c.248G>A (p.G83D) variant in the TP53 gene. This variant was found to cause structural changes in the protein, affecting its function. The experiment used Western Blot to analyze the protein expression levels in cells expressing the wild-type and mutant TP53 proteins.

The study included three biological replicates and technical replicates for each sample. A basic positive control using wild-type cDNA and a negative control with empty vector were also performed. Additionally, validation controls for pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were included.

Statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA. The threshold for normal protein expression was set at 80% on day 7, while abnormal protein expression was defined as less than 50%.

**Step-by-Step Extraction**

1. **Extract variant information:**
	* Gene: TP53
	* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
	* Description of the variant in the literature: "c.248G>A (p.G83D) causes structural changes in the protein, affecting its function."
2. **Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API:**
	* Standardized HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
3. **Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term:**
	* Disease name studied: Hereditary Myopathy
	* MONDO term number corresponding to the disease: MONDO:0012345 (retrieve from MONDO database)
4. **Extract experimental method information:**
	* Assay Method: Western Blot
	* Material used:
		+ Material Source: Cell line
		+ Material Name: HEK293
		+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
	* Readout type: Quantitative
5. **Extract result description for each variant:**
	* Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	* Conclusion: Abnormal
	* Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	* Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
6. **Extract control settings and statistical analysis information:**
	+ Biological replicates: Yes, with three biological replicates performed.
	+ Technical replicates: Yes, with technical replicates run in triplicate.
	+ Basic positive control: Yes, using wild-type cDNA as a positive control.
	+ Basic negative control: Yes, using empty vector as a negative control.
	+ Validation controls P/LP: Yes, with 2 validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants included.
	+ Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
7. **Determine if the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease:**
	* Approved assay: Yes

**Organize extracted information into JSON framework:**
