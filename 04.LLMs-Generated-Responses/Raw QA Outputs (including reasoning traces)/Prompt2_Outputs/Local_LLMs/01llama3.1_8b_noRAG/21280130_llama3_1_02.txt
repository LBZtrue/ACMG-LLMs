To address the provided problem, I will break down the solution into steps and provide a detailed response according to the format requested.

## Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information.
First, we need to thoroughly read the literature in question. This involves identifying the specific variants mentioned, their locations on the gene (cDNA change), how these changes affect the protein (protein change), and any descriptive text that accompanies these variants.

## Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
After extracting the initial information about each variant, we need to standardize its HGVS nomenclature. This involves using a database or API such as Ensembl, RefSeq, or HGNC to validate and normalize the variant's description into the standardized HGVS format.

## Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
The next step is to identify which disease was being studied. Once identified, we need to find its corresponding term in the Monarch Initiative's MONDO database. This ensures that our representation of the disease accurately reflects its current categorization within biomedical ontologies.

## Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method.
Now, we need to detail each experimental protocol used. This includes identifying the type of assay or method (assay method), what materials were used (material source, material name, description), how results were read out (readout type, readout description for each variant), whether biological or technical replicates were performed, and any other relevant details such as positive and negative controls.

## Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
We need to verify if the described experimental protocols are commonly accepted practices within the scientific community for investigating the specified disease. This might involve reviewing literature or databases that catalog standard methodologies for each disease type.

## Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.
Finally, we organize all the extracted data into a format that matches the provided JSON structure. This includes listing variants with their HGVS notation, describing diseases with their MONDO terms, detailing experimental methods, and indicating whether these are approved assays for studying the disease in question.

The final answer is: There is no numerical solution to this problem as it involves extracting and organizing information based on specific tasks related to a piece of literature.
