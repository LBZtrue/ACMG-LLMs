Based on the provided specifications, I will outline the steps to complete the task:

**Step 1: Extract relevant variant information from the literature**

* Identify the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes for each variant mentioned in the literature.
* Example:
	+ Gene: TP53
	+ Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
	+ cDNA Change: transcript = NM_001126112.3, ref = G, alt = A, position = 248
	+ Protein Change: ref = G, alt = D, position = 83

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature via relevant API**

* Use a suitable API (e.g., Ensembl) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.
* Example:
	+ Standardized HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve corresponding MONDO terms**

* Determine the disease name mentioned in the literature (e.g., "Hereditary Myopathy").
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the MONDO database.
* Example:
	+ Disease Name: Hereditary Myopathy
	+ MONDO Term: MONDO:0012345

**Step 4: Extract experimental method details**

* Identify all experimental methods mentioned in the literature (e.g., Western Blot).
* For each method, extract detailed information about material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
* Example:
	+ Assay Method: Western Blot
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Readout Type: Quantitative

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

* Based on external knowledge or literature review, determine whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is commonly accepted for studying the specific disease.
* Example:
	+ Approved Assay: Yes (Western Blot is a widely accepted method for studying protein expression)

**Step 6: Organize extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

* Structure the data into the specified JSON format, including "Variants Include," "Described Disease," and "Experiment Method" sections.
* Example:
```json
