Based on the provided specification, I will outline the steps to extract and organize the information from the literature into the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Extract variant information**

* Read the literature and identify all variants mentioned.
* For each variant:
	+ Record the gene name.
	+ Extract the preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A).
	+ Identify the cDNA changes (transcript, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position).
	+ Identify the protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position).

**Step 2: Standardize HGVS nomenclature**

* Use a relevant API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant.

**Step 3: Identify disease and retrieve MONDO term**

* Read the literature and identify the disease studied.
* Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term from the database.

**Step 4: Extract experimental method information**

* List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature.
* For each method:
	+ Record the name of the assay (e.g., Western Blot).
	+ Identify the material used (source, name, description).
	+ Determine the readout type (quantitative/qualitative).
	+ Extract result descriptions for each variant mentioned.

**Step 5: Organize information into JSON framework**

* Create a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {...},
                    "Protein Change": {...},
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {...},
            "Readout type": "Quantitative",
            "Readout description": [...],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```
**Step 6: Fill in additional fields**

* For each experimental method:
	+ Determine whether biological replicates were performed.
	+ Determine whether technical replicates were performed.
	+ Identify the basic positive and negative controls.
	+ Identify validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants.
	+ Identify validation controls for benign/likely benign variants.
	+ Record the statistical analysis method used.
	+ Determine the threshold for normal readout (if not described in the literature, use a standard value).
	+ Determine the threshold for abnormal readout (if not described in the literature, use a standard value).
	+ Indicate whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease.

The final JSON object will contain all extracted and standardized information.
