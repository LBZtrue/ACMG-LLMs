Based on the provided workflow and examples, I will guide you through the steps to extract and standardize the information from the literature. Please note that this is a complex task requiring careful attention to detail.

**Step 1: Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information**

Read the given text carefully and identify the variants mentioned in the literature. For each variant, record the following information:

* Gene name
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature (e.g., NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A)
* cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, and position)
* Protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, and position)

**Step 2: Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API**

Use a reliable API (e.g., Ensembl, UCSC Genome Browser) to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant. This will provide the final, accurate HGVS notation.

**Step 3: Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database**

Based on the text, identify the disease mentioned as "Hereditary Myopathy" (in Example 1). Then, use the MONDO database to retrieve the corresponding term for this disease. In Example 1, the MONDO term is "MONDO:0012345".

**Step 4: List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method**

Identify the experimental methods used in the study (e.g., Western Blot). For each method, record the following details:

* Assay Method
* Material used:
	+ Material Source
	+ Material Name
	+ Description of the material
* Readout type
* Result description for each variant mentioned in the literature or listed in "Variants Include"
* Experimental replicates (biological and technical)
* Control settings (basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls P/LP, and B/LB)
* Statistical analysis method
* Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts
* Whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease

**Step 5: Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease**

Based on your knowledge and research, determine whether the experimental protocols mentioned in the study are commonly used to investigate this specific disease.

**Step 6: Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework**

Using the defined JSON structure (in Example 1), populate each section with the relevant data. Ensure that all required fields are filled accurately, including HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, material used, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis method, thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts, and approved assay status.

**Final Answer**

Based on the given examples and workflow, here is a sample JSON output:
