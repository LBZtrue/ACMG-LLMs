Based on the provided specifications, I will guide you through the process of creating the JSON framework for extracting and standardizing variant information from a given literature.

### Step 1: Extract Variant Information
- **Gene Name:** Extract the gene name mentioned in the literature. For example, "TP53".
- **Preliminary HGVS Nomenclature:** Note down the preliminary HGVS nomenclature of the variant as mentioned in the literature. This will be used for further standardization.
- **cDNA Changes and Protein Changes:** Record the cDNA changes (transcript number, reference nucleotide, alternative nucleotide, position) and protein changes (reference amino acid, alternative amino acid, position) related to the variant.

### Step 2: Standardize HGVS Nomenclature
Use a relevant API to standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature of the variants. Ensure that the standardized HGVS is formatted as specified in the JSON framework.

### Step 3: Identify Disease and Retrieve MONDO Term
- **Disease Name:** Identify the disease mentioned or studied in the literature.
- **MONDO Term:** Look up the corresponding MONDO term for the identified disease in the MONDO database.

### Step 4: Extract Experimental Method Information
- **Assay Method:** Note down the name of the experimental method used (e.g., Western Blot).
- **Material Used:** Record information about the material used, including its source, name, and a description.
- **Readout Type and Description:** Determine if the readout is qualitative or quantitative. For each variant, note down any conclusion regarding the result's abnormality, the molecular effect of the variant, and a specific description of the experimental result.

### Step 5: Organize Extracted Information
Use the predefined JSON framework to organize the extracted and standardized information for both variants and the described disease. Ensure that all fields are correctly populated with the extracted data.

Below is an example of how this might look in code:

```python
import json

# Define the function to extract and standardize variant information
def extract_and_standardize(variant_info, literature_text):
    # Initialize variables for storing standardized HGVS nomenclature
    standardized_hgvs = []

    # Loop through each variant mentioned in the literature text
    for variant in variant_info:
        # Extract preliminary HGVS nomenclature and cDNA/protein changes from the literature
        preliminary_hgvs = variant['hgvs_nomenclature']
        transcript, ref, alt, position = extract_cDNA_change(preliminary_hgvs)
        ref_aa, alt_aa, aa_position = extract_protein_change(literature_text)

        # Standardize HGVS nomenclature using API
        standardized_hgvs.append({
            "HGVS": standardize_HGVS(preliminary_hgvs),
            "cDNA Change": {
                "transcript": transcript,
                "ref": ref,
                "alt": alt,
                "position": position
            },
            "Protein Change": {
                "ref": ref_aa,
                "alt": alt_aa,
                "position": aa_position
            },
            "Description in input context": variant['description']
        })

    # Extract disease name and MONDO term from the literature text
    disease_name = extract_disease_name(literature_text)
    mondo_term = retrieve_MONDO_term(disease_name)

    # Extract experimental method information
    assay_methods, material_used, readout_type_and_description = extract_experimental_method_info(literature_text)

    # Create JSON object with standardized data
    json_data = {
        "Variants Include": standardized_hgvs,
        "Described Disease": {
            "Described Disease": disease_name,
            "MONDO": mondo_term
        },
        "Experiment Method": assay_methods
    }

    return json.dumps(json_data)

# Function to extract specific information from literature text
def extract_cDNA_change(hgvs):
    # Simulate extraction based on HGVS format; in actual implementation, use a parsing library or regular expressions.
    parts = hgvs.split(":")
    transcript = parts[0]
    ref_alt = parts[1].split("c.")
    return transcript, ref_alt[0], ref_alt[1][0], int(ref_alt[1][1:])

def extract_protein_change(literature_text):
    # Simulate extraction based on literature text; in actual implementation, use natural language processing or regular expressions.
    protein_changes = "p.G83D"
    parts = protein_changes.split("(")
    return parts[0], parts[1].split(":")[0][:-1], int(parts[1].split(":")[0][-1:])

# Main function to execute
def main():
    # Example usage with provided literature text and variant information
    variant_info = [
        {
            "hgvs_nomenclature": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
            "description": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
        }
    ]
    literature_text = "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."
    
    json_data = extract_and_standardize(variant_info, literature_text)
    print(json_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Example Output
```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
      "cDNA Change": {

        "position": "248"
      },
      "Protein Change": {
        "ref": "G",
        "alt": "D",
        "position": "83"
      },
      "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
    }
  ],

        "Material Name": "HEK293",
        "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
      },
      "Readout type": "Quantitative",
      "Readout description": [
        {
          "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
          "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
          "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function",
          "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
This output represents a simplified version of how the JSON framework might look after processing the literature text and extracting relevant information about variants, diseases, and experimental methods.

The actual implementation will vary based on specific requirements for handling variant information, disease names, and experimental method details. This example serves as a starting point for developing a more comprehensive solution tailored to your needs.
