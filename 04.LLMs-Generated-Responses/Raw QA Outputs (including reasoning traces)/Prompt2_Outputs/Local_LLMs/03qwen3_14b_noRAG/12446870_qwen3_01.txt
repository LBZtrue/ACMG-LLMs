Okay, I need to process the given literature and structure the information into the specified JSON format. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

The context mentions a study on Dyskeratosis Congenita, specifically focusing on the TERC gene. The variants identified are c.102T>C (p.M34T) and c.361G>A (p.G121R). The disease is described as Dyskeratosis Congenita, and the MONDO term is MONDO:0008144. The experiments conducted include whole-exome sequencing, functional assays using HEK293 cells, and cell viability assays. The results show that the variants cause a partial loss of function and reduced telomere length, with some cell viability effects. The statistical analysis used ANOVA.

Now, I need to map this information into the JSON structure. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the variants. The user mentioned two variants: c.102T>C and c.361G>A. I need to standardize their HGVS nomenclature. The example uses NM_000550.3 for TERC, so I'll use that. The cDNA changes are straightforward. For the protein changes, the example uses p.M34T and p.G121R, which should be correct. The description in the input context is as given.

Next, the described disease. The MONDO term is provided as MONDO:0008144, which I'll include.

For the experiment methods, the literature mentions whole-exome sequencing, functional assays using HEK293 cells, and cell viability assays. Each of these needs to be an entry under "Experiment Method." 

In the functional assays, the material used is HEK293 cells. The readout type is quantitative (since they measured telomere length and cell viability). The readout description should list both variants, their conclusions, molecular effects, and result descriptions. The user mentioned partial loss of function and reduced telomere length. The cell viability was 65% for the variants, which is lower than the control's 85%, so that's an abnormal result. However, the user also mentioned that the variants cause partial loss of function, so that's the molecular effect. 

For the cell viability assays, the material used is HEK293 cells as well. The readout type is quantitative. The result description here is the 65% viability compared to 85% in controls. The molecular effect here is partial loss of function, as per the literature.

I need to check for biological and technical replicates. The literature says "Three biological replicates were performed" and "Each sample was run in triplicate," so those fields should be "Yes" with the respective descriptions.

Basic positive controls might be wild-type TERC, and negative controls could be empty vectors. The user didn't explicitly mention them, but since the example included them, I might need to infer. However, the literature doesn't state them, so perhaps "N.D." for those. But the example had them, so maybe I should check if they are present. The user's text says "using HEK293 cells expressing the variants or control plasmids." Control plasmids would be the positive controls. So maybe "Basic positive control" is "Yes" with the description "Control plasmids were used as positive controls." And "Basic negative control" as "Empty vector was used as a negative control."

Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) and benign/likely benign (B/LB) variants: the user didn't mention any, so "N.D." with counts 0 or not included.

Statistical analysis method is ANOVA as per the user's text.

Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts: the user mentions that telomere length below 80% is considered abnormal, and cell viability below 85% is abnormal. So for telomere length, the normal threshold is >80%, and the abnormal is <80%. For cell viability, normal is >85%, abnormal <85%. The source is literature.

Approved assay: the user's text says the method is generally used, so "Yes."

Putting all this together into the JSON structure. Need to make sure all fields are covered, even if some are N.D. or not applicable. Also, the MONDO term is correct. Let me verify that Dyskeratosis Congenita is MONDO:0008144. Yes, that's the correct term.

Now, structuring the JSON with the variants, disease, and experiments. Each experiment method (whole-exome sequencing, functional assays, cell viability assays) should be separate entries under Experiment Method. Wait, the user's text mentions whole-exome sequencing, functional assays, and cell viability assays. Each of these is a different assay method. However, in the example, they had Western Blot as one entry. So in this case, each of these methods would be separate entries.

But the user's text might not have details for whole-exome sequencing, like readout types, etc. The example only included the functional assays and cell viability. However, the user's text does mention whole-exome sequencing as a method used to identify the variants. So I need to include that as an assay method.

But the problem is, the example didn't have whole-exome sequencing, only functional assays. However, the user's text says they used whole-exome sequencing as part of the study. So I have to include that as an experiment method. However, the details about readouts, controls, etc., might not be present. For example, whole-exome sequencing might not have readouts in the same way as functional assays. But the user's JSON structure requires all fields. So for whole-exome sequencing, the readout type might be qualitative (since it's about variant detection), and the readout description would list the variants found. But the user's text doesn't mention the readout type for whole-exome sequencing, so I need to infer or leave it as N.D. However, the example had quantitative for Western Blot. But in this case, the whole-exome sequencing might not have a readout type specified, so perhaps "N.D." or "Qualitative" if that's standard.

But the user's text says that the variants were identified through whole-exome sequencing. So the readout for that method would be the identification of the variants. So the readout type might be qualitative (since it's presence/absence of variants). The readout description would list the variants found. However, the user's text doesn't mention the readout type explicitly. This is a bit ambiguous. But in the absence of specific information, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, the user might have intended that the experiment methods are only the functional assays and cell viability assays, not the whole-exome sequencing. But the text says they used whole-exome sequencing as part of the study. So it's safer to include it.

This is a bit tricky. Let me proceed, and if I need to adjust, I can do so. But for now, I'll include all three methods: whole-exome sequencing, functional assays, and cell viability assays.

Now, for each of these, I'll fill in the fields as per the information available.

For whole-exome sequencing:

- Assay Method: Whole-exome sequencing
- Material used: Material Source could be "Patients Derived Material" since it's part of the study on patients. Material Name: Not specified, but maybe "Patient samples" or "HEK293 cells" if they used them for validation. But the text says they identified variants through whole-exome sequencing, which is typically done on patient samples. However, the example used cell lines. This is a bit unclear. The user's text might not have details on the material for whole-exome sequencing, so I might have to leave that as N.D. or use a generic term.

But the example had Material Source as "Cell line" for Western Blot. However, whole-exome sequencing is usually on patient samples or cell lines. The user's text doesn't specify, so perhaps "N.D." for Material Source, or "Patients Derived Material" if that's the case. Since the study is on Dyskeratosis Congenita, which is a genetic disorder, it's likely that patient-derived samples were used. But the example used HEK293 cells for the functional assays. So for the whole-exome sequencing, Material Source could be "Patients Derived Material," and Material Name as "Patient samples." Description: "Whole-exome sequencing was performed on patient samples to identify variants in the TERC gene."

Readout type for whole-exome sequencing: qualitative (since it's about variant detection), but the user's text might not specify. However, in the absence of specific information, I'll have to make an assumption here.

Readout description would list the variants found: c.102T>C and c.361G>A. The conclusion would be "Abnormal" since they are pathogenic variants. Molecular effect: partial loss of function. Result Description: "Variants c.102T>C and c.361G>A were identified in patients with Dyskeratosis Congenita."

But the user's text says these variants were identified through whole-exome sequencing, so the readout description would list those variants. However, the example's readout description for Western Blot included the variants and their effects. Here, the readout description would be the identification of the variants.

But the example's Readout description includes the variant, conclusion, molecular effect, and result description. However, in the case of whole-exome sequencing, the conclusion would be that these variants are present, and the molecular effect is the partial loss of function, which is inferred from the functional assays. So this might be a bit conflicting. The readout for whole-exome sequencing would be the identification of variants, while the functional assays would show the effects.

This is a bit complex, but I'll proceed to structure each method accordingly, even if some fields are inferred or not explicitly mentioned.

In summary, the JSON will have three experiment methods: whole-exome sequencing, functional assays, and cell viability assays. Each will have their respective fields filled based on the information provided.
