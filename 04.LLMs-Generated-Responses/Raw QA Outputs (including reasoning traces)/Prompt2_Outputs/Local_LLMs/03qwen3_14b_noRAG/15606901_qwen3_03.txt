Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and examples, and they want the assistant to extract information from given literature and format it accordingly. The main task is to parse the literature, extract variants, standardize their HGVS, identify the disease, and then detail the experimental methods with all the required parameters.

First, I need to look at the literature provided. Wait, the user hasn't actually included the literature text here. The initial prompt mentions "Context" but the content under it is just the user's instructions. Hmm, that's a problem. Without the actual literature text, I can't extract the variants, disease, or experimental methods. The user might have forgotten to include the literature in their input.

But looking back, the user provided an example where the literature mentions a variant in TP53 and a disease Hereditary Myopathy. However, in the actual query, the user hasn't provided any specific literature content. This is a critical missing piece. Without the literature, I can't proceed with the extraction.

Wait, maybe the user intended to include the literature in the context section but forgot. Let me check again. The context starts with "Context" and then has the user's instructions. There's no actual literature content provided. That's a problem. The assistant can't process this without the literature text.

In this case, the correct approach would be to inform the user that the literature text is missing. However, since the user might have intended to include it and perhaps made a mistake, maybe I should proceed with the example they provided. But the example is separate and not part of the actual literature they want to process.

Alternatively, maybe the user is testing the assistant's ability to handle the structure even without the literature. But that's not helpful. The answer would be incomplete or based on the example, which might not be what they want.

Given the ambiguity, the safest response is to point out that the literature text is missing and that the assistant can't proceed without it. However, since the user might have intended to include the literature in the context but forgot, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the example provided in the "Examples" section as a demonstration.

But the user's actual query doesn't include any literature content. Therefore, the correct answer is to state that the literature is missing and that the assistant can't extract the required information without it. However, in the absence of that, the assistant might have to use the example as a placeholder, but that's not accurate.

Alternatively, the user might have pasted the literature in the context but it's not visible here. But in the given input, the context is only the user's instructions. Therefore, the assistant must respond that the literature is missing.

The literature text required to extract variant information, disease details, and experimental methods is missing from the input. Without the actual text of the study or article being analyzed, it is not possible to populate the JSON structure with accurate data. Please provide the full text of the literature to proceed with the extraction and formatting as specified.
