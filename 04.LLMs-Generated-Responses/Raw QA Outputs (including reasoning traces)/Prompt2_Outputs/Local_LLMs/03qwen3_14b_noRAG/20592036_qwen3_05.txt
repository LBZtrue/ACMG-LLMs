Okay, let's tackle this user's query. They provided a detailed JSON structure and an example, but the main task is to process the given literature and extract the required information. However, looking at the user's message, they mentioned the context includes several scientific papers, but the actual content of the literature isn't provided. The example given is hypothetical, so the user might be expecting me to generate a similar structure based on hypothetical data, but they might have intended to provide the actual literature content.

Wait, the user's message starts with "Context:" and lists several references, but there's no actual text from the literature. The example they gave is for a TP53 variant and Hereditary Myopathy. However, the user's instruction says to process the literature mentioned in the context. But since the literature content isn't provided, perhaps the user made a mistake, or maybe they expect me to use the example as the input.

Alternatively, maybe the user is testing if I can generate a correct JSON based on the example, even without the actual literature. But that's not helpful. The example is just illustrative. The user might have intended to include the literature content but forgot. In that case, I need to inform them that the literature content is missing. However, since the user provided the example, maybe they want me to use that as the input. But the example isn't part of the context.

Hmm, the user's problem is that the context doesn't include the actual literature content. Without that, I can't extract the variants, disease, or experiments. The user might have intended to include the literature but it's missing. So, the correct approach is to point out that the literature content is missing, and thus the answer can't be generated. But the user might have made a mistake and included the example as part of the context. However, in the given context, there's no literature content. The references are just citations, not the actual text.

Therefore, the answer should indicate that the literature content is missing, and thus the required information can't be extracted. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the example as the input, but that's not clear. But given the information provided, the answer can't be generated without the actual literature content. The user needs to provide the text of the studies mentioned in the context to proceed.
