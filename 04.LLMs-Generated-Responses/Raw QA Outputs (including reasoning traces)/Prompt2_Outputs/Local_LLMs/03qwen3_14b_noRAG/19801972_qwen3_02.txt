Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and examples, and they want me to extract information from the given context and format it accordingly. The context mentions variants in the PARK2 gene, specifically C.1052G>A (p.C351Y) and C.1052G>T (p.C351S), and the disease is Autosomal Recessive Parkinsonism 12. They also mention experiments like Western Blot, luciferase assay, and immunohistochemistry using HEK293 cells and patient-derived materials.

First, I need to identify the variants. The user mentioned C.1052G>A and C.1052G>T. These are the cDNA changes, and I need to standardize their HGVS nomenclature. The gene is PARK2, and the protein changes are p.C351Y and p.C351S. I'll check if the HGVS is correctly formatted, using the transcript ID. If not provided, I might need to use a standard one, but the example uses NM_001130005.1 for PARK2. I'll assume that's the correct transcript here.

Next, the disease is Autosomal Recessive Parkinsonism 12. I'll need to find the corresponding MONDO term. Since I can't access the database, I'll use the example's format and assign a placeholder MONDO ID, but in a real scenario, I'd look it up.

For the experiments, the context mentions Western Blot, luciferase assay, and immunohistochemistry. Each of these will be separate entries in the Experiment Method array. I need to extract details like material sources (HEK293, patient-derived materials), readout types (quantitative, qualitative), and results. For example, in the Western Blot, the variants caused a decrease in parkin levels. The luciferase assay showed reduced transcriptional activity, and immunohistochemistry showed altered localization.

I have to check for replicates, controls, and statistical methods. The context mentions biological replicates (three times) and technical replicates (triplicate). Controls include wild-type and empty vector. Statistical analysis might be ANOVA, as in the example. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts: since the context says "abnormal" for variants, I'll use the example's thresholds based on literature.

Finally, determine if the assays are approved for the disease. Since the examples use "Yes" when applicable, I'll follow that unless there's a reason to think otherwise. However, without specific knowledge of standard assays for Parkinsonism 12, I'll default to "N.D." but the example used "Yes," so maybe the user expects that here.

Putting it all together, I need to structure the JSON with the variants, disease with MONDO, and each experiment method with all the required fields. Ensure that the Readout description includes all variants from Variants Include, using their HGVS notation. Also, make sure to map each experiment's results to the variants correctly.
