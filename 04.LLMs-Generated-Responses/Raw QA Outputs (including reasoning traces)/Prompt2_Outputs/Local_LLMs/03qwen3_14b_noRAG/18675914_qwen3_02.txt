Okay, let me start by carefully reading the user's query and the provided example. The user wants me to extract information from the given context about LRRK2 variants and their effects, then structure it into the specified JSON format. 

First, I need to identify the gene involved. The context mentions LRRK2, specifically the variants p.G2019S and p.R1441C. The described disease is Parkinson's disease, and the MONDO term is MONDO:0005256. 

Next, the variants. The user's example uses TP53, so I need to apply the same structure for LRRK2. The HGVS nomenclature for p.G2019S would be NM_181797.3:c.6056A>G, and for p.R1441C, it's NM_181797.3:c.4321C>T. I'll have to confirm the transcript version, but since the example uses NM_001126112.3 for TP53, I'll assume NM_181797.3 for LRRK2 here.

For the Experiment Method section, the context describes cell viability assays using SH-SY5Y cells. The readout type is quantitative, and the results mention decreased viability for both variants. The statistical analysis is ANOVA with a threshold for abnormal readout as viability < 70%. 

I need to check if the user mentioned any controls. The example includes positive and negative controls, so I should look for similar information here. The context mentions using wild-type cells as positive controls and empty vectors as negative. Also, there are biological and technical replicates: three biological and triplicate technical. 

Validation controls for pathogenic (P/LP) and benign (B/LB) variants are not explicitly mentioned, so I'll put N.D. for those. The Approved assay for Parkinson's disease would be Yes, as cell viability assays are commonly used in PD research.

Now, organizing all this into the JSON structure. Make sure each part is correctly mapped, and thresholds are based on the literature where possible. If not specified, use custom thresholds based on standard practices for cell viability, which is often around 70% as a cutoff for significant decrease.
