Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract and structure information from a set of scientific literature references into a specific JSON format. The example given is a hypothetical one, so I need to figure out how to apply the same structure to the actual references provided.

First, I need to parse the literature entries. Each entry has a title, authors, journal, year, volume, issue, pages, and a DOI. The task is to extract variants, the described disease, and experimental methods. However, looking at the provided references, none of them mention specific genes, variants, diseases, or experimental methods. The references are about topics like protein folding, structural biology, and molecular mechanisms, but they don't provide the detailed information required for the JSON structure.

Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the context. They provided references but didn't include the actual content of the papers. The example given in the instructions assumes that the literature mentions specific variants, diseases, and experiments. However, the user's context only includes the references without the actual text. That's a problem because without the content, I can't extract the necessary details.

In the absence of the actual paper content, I can't proceed with extracting variants, diseases, or experimental methods. The user might have intended to include the paper content in the context but forgot. Alternatively, they might expect me to use the references to infer the information, but that's not feasible. The references only give publication details, not the content.

Therefore, the answer would be that the information required isn't present in the provided context. The user needs to provide the actual content of the papers to extract the necessary details. Without that, the JSON structure can't be filled out as per the example.

The provided literature references (titles, authors, journals, etc.) do not include the specific content required to extract variant information, disease descriptions, or experimental methods. The JSON structure outlined in the example requires detailed information about **genes, variants, molecular effects, experimental protocols, and disease contexts**, which are **not present** in the given references. 

To proceed with the task, the actual **textual content** of the papers (e.g., descriptions of variants, functional experiments, disease associations, and methodological details) would need to be provided. Without this, the requested JSON output cannot be generated. 

If you can supply the full text or specific excerpts from the papers, I can extract and structure the data accordingly.
