Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from a set of provided literature references and structure it into a specific JSON format. The example given is helpful, but I need to make sure I understand all the requirements.

First, I need to parse the literature to identify any variants mentioned. The user provided several references, but looking at them, they seem to be citations without actual text. Wait, the user might have made a mistake here. The references listed are just titles and authors, not the actual content of the papers. That's a problem because without the actual text, I can't extract the variants, diseases, or experimental methods. But maybe the user intended to provide the text, and there was a formatting error. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects me to use the example structure even without the actual content, which doesn't make sense. 

Wait, looking back at the user's message, the context is a list of references, but the actual literature content isn't provided. The example given in the user's instructions is a hypothetical scenario. So maybe the user is expecting me to use the example as a template and not the actual references. But that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include the actual text of the literature but it was omitted. 

In any case, based on the information provided, there's no actual text to extract from. The references listed are just citations. Therefore, I need to inform the user that without the actual content of the literature, I can't proceed. However, the user might have intended to provide the literature content in the references, but it's not clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is testing the system with the example given, expecting a similar structure. But the example is hypothetical, and the actual references are just citations. Therefore, I should point out that the necessary information (the actual text of the papers) is missing and that I can't extract the required data without it. 

Another angle: perhaps the user is using the references as placeholders and expects the assistant to generate a sample based on the example. But without knowing the actual content of the papers, that's not feasible. 

In conclusion, the correct approach is to inform the user that the provided references don't contain the necessary text to extract the required information and ask for the actual content of the literature. However, since the user might have made a mistake, I should also check if they intended to include the text in the references and clarify if needed.

The provided references do not include the actual text of the literature, making it impossible to extract variant information, disease details, or experimental methods. To proceed, please provide the full text of the literature or clarify if the references are placeholders for hypothetical examples. Without this information, the task cannot be completed as requested.
