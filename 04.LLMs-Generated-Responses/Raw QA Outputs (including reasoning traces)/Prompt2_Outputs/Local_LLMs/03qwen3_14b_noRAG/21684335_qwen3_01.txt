Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and an example, so they want the answer in that specific format. First, I need to parse the given literature references and extract the necessary information.

Looking at the references, there are several studies on Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), mentioning variants like GBA, SNCA, LRRK2, and others. The task is to extract these variants, their HGVS nomenclature, cDNA and protein changes, and then map the described disease to MONDO terms.

First, I'll list all the variants mentioned. For example, in the first reference, GBA p.N370S and p.L444P are mentioned. I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for these variants. I'll check the HGVS database to confirm the correct transcript IDs and positions. For GBA, the common transcript is NM_000520.3. So, p.N370S would be NM_000520.3:c.1099A>T, and p.L444P would be NM_000520.3:c.1331T>C. Wait, but the user's example used NM_001126112.3 for TP53. I need to make sure the transcript IDs are correct for each gene.

Next, the described disease here is Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease with dementia. I need to find the MONDO terms for these. MONDO:0005332 is Parkinson's disease, and MONDO:0018265 might be Parkinson's disease with dementia. I'll verify that.

Then, for each experiment method mentioned in the references, like cell culture, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, etc., I need to extract details. However, the user's example included specific experimental methods with materials, replicates, controls, etc. But looking at the references, they mention studies but not detailed experimental methods. For example, the first reference talks about a study on GBA variants, but it doesn't specify the assay methods used. Hmm, that's a problem. The user's example had a Western Blot method with detailed controls, but the provided literature doesn't have that level of detail. Maybe the user expects that even if the methods aren't explicitly detailed, we can infer based on common practices for these studies.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to extract detailed information about each method from the literature. If the literature doesn't mention specific methods, then I have to put N.D. for those fields. However, the example given by the user included a Western Blot method with all the details. But in the provided references, the methods aren't described in detail. So, I might need to note that the methods are not specified in the literature, leading to N.D. in those fields.

Another point: the user's example had a "Readout description" that included all variants from "Variants Include". For each variant, the conclusion, molecular effect, and result description are needed. But the literature references don't provide specific results for each variant. They mention studies but not the outcomes. So, I might have to use N.D. for those parts as well.

This is challenging because the user expects a structured JSON, but the literature provided lacks the detailed experimental methods and results. However, the user might be expecting that even if the information isn't present, we can use N.D. or infer based on standard practices. For example, if a study is on GBA variants, common methods might be Western blot, immunohistochemistry, etc., and controls might be wild-type or other variants. But without explicit mentions, this is speculative.

I need to proceed carefully, ensuring that any inferred information is marked as N.D. if not present in the literature. For the MONDO terms, I'll use the correct identifiers. For the variants, I'll standardize the HGVS nomenclature using the HGVS database. If the exact transcript isn't specified, I'll use the most common one for each gene.

Let me start by listing all the variants mentioned, then standardize them, find the MONDO terms, and then handle the experiment methods with the available information, using N.D. where necessary.
