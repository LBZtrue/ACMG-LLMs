Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and an example, and they want me to process the given literature to extract the required information. First, I need to parse the literature they mentioned. Wait, looking back, the user's input is the context given in the initial problem. The actual literature content isn't provided here. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Wait, the user's message starts with "Context:" and then lists a series of references, but no actual text of the literature. That's a problem because the task requires extracting variants, diseases, and experiments from the literature. Without the actual text, I can't proceed. However, looking at the example they provided, maybe they expect me to use that as a template or there's a mistake in the input. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include the literature text but forgot. In this case, since there's no literature content provided, I can't extract the necessary information. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the references listed are the literature, but they are just citations without the actual content. Without the actual text, I can't extract the variants, diseases, or experiments. So, the answer would be that the literature is not provided, and thus the information can't be extracted. However, the user might have expected the assistant to use the example given in the problem statement. Wait, in the example, they mentioned a TP53 variant and Hereditary Myopathy, but that's just an example. The actual user's literature isn't provided here. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that the literature content is missing, making it impossible to proceed. But maybe the user intended to include the literature in the context. Let me check again. The context starts with "Context:" followed by a list of references, but no actual text. So, I need to point out that the literature is not provided, and hence the information can't be extracted. However, the user might have intended to include the literature in the context, but it's not there. Therefore, the answer is that the literature is missing, and the JSON can't be generated.
