Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They provided a detailed JSON structure and an example, and they want me to extract information from the given literature excerpts and format it accordingly.

First, I need to parse the literature excerpts. Let me look through each entry.

Starting with the first paper: "Spiral: A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Protein-Ligand Binding Affinities." The title mentions a deep learning framework, but the abstract talks about predicting binding affinities. The variants mentioned here are in the context of the framework, not specific genes. Wait, the user's example has variants, but here, the literature excerpts don't mention specific gene variants. Hmm, maybe the user is testing if I can handle cases where variants aren't explicitly mentioned. But the user's example includes variants, so perhaps the given literature here doesn't have variants? Wait, the user's instruction says to extract variants from the literature, but in the provided excerpts, there are no variants listed. That's a problem. Let me check again.

Looking at the second paper: "A Dual-Stage Transformer Network for Predicting Protein-Protein Interaction Sites." Again, no variants mentioned. Third paper: "Deep Learning-Based Predictive Model for Protein Stability upon Mutation." This one might have variants. Let me check the abstract. It says "predictive model for protein stability upon mutation" but doesn't list specific variants. The fourth paper: "AlphaFold2: A Deep Learning-Based Protein Structure Prediction Tool." No variants here. Fifth: "DeepLearning-Driven Discovery of Novel Allosteric Modulators for GPCRs." No variants. Sixth: "A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Protein-Ligand Binding Affinities." No variants. Seventh: "Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Protein-Protein Interaction Sites in the Human Proteome." No variants. Eighth: "A Novel Deep Learning Architecture for Predicting the Effects of Missense Mutations on Protein Function." Wait, this one mentions "missense mutations" but doesn't specify any particular genes or variants. The abstract says "predicting the effects of missense mutations on protein function" but doesn't list specific variants. The ninth paper: "Deep Learning for the Prediction of Protein Stability Changes upon Mutation." Again, no specific variants. Tenth: "A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting the Impact of Single-Nucleotide Variants on Protein Function." Here, "single-nucleotide variants" are mentioned, but again, no specific genes or variants listed.

So, all the provided literature excerpts are about deep learning models predicting various aspects of protein behavior, but none explicitly mention specific gene variants with their HGVS nomenclature. The user's example included a variant in TP53, but the actual literature here doesn't have that. Therefore, the "Variants Include" section would be empty. However, the user might have intended that the literature excerpts are different, but given the provided text, there are no variants to extract.

Next, the described disease. The user's example had "Hereditary Myopathy," but in these papers, the diseases aren't mentioned. The papers discuss predicting binding affinities, protein stability, interaction sites, etc., but not specific diseases. Therefore, the "Described Disease" might be missing or have to be inferred. However, since the user's instruction is to extract from the literature, and the literature doesn't mention diseases, this section would also be empty unless the user intended a different context.

For the "Experiment Method" section, each paper describes different methods. For example, the first paper uses a deep learning framework, the second uses a dual-stage transformer network, etc. However, the user's example had "Western Blot" as an assay method, but the literature here doesn't mention Western Blot or similar methods. The methods are computational models, not experimental assays. Therefore, the "Experiment Method" would need to list the computational methods, but the JSON structure is designed for experimental methods. This might be a mismatch. The user might have intended that the literature excerpts are different, but given the provided text, the methods are not experimental assays but computational models.

Putting this all together, the JSON would have "Variants Include" as empty, "Described Disease" as empty or inferred (but no disease is mentioned), and "Experiment Method" would list the computational methods, but the JSON structure might not fit. However, the user might have provided a different set of literature excerpts, but based on the given text, this is the case.

I need to proceed with the information available, even if it's not as in the example. So, the answer would have empty sections where variants and diseases are mentioned, and the experiment methods would be computational models, but the JSON structure expects experimental methods. This might require noting that the literature doesn't contain the required information.
