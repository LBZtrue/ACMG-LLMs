Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a JSON structure based on the provided literature about parkinsonism and variants in the SNCA gene. First, I need to parse the given text to extract all the necessary information.

Looking at the literature, the main disease mentioned is parkinsonism. I need to check MONDO for the correct term. I remember that Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005252, but since the text refers to parkinsonism, which is a broader term, maybe it's MONDO:0005252 as well, or perhaps a different one. I'll need to confirm that.

Next, the variants. The text mentions two variants: c.100G>A (p.G34S) and c.100G>C (p.G34R). I need to standardize these HGVS notations. The user's example used NM_001126112.3, but the SNCA gene's transcript might be different. I should check the correct transcript ID for SNCA. Let's say it's NM_000345.4. Then, the cDNA changes would be position 100, G to A and G to C. Protein changes: G34 to S and R.

For the experiment methods, the literature mentions using HEK293 cells, but the example used HEK293. The methods include western blot and immunohistochemistry. Each method's details need to be extracted. For western blot, the readout is quantitative, and the results for each variant are described. The controls would be wild-type and empty vector. The thresholds for normal and abnormal are based on protein expression levels. The approved assay for parkinsonism might be yes, as western blot is a common method.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format provided. Make sure that each section is filled correctly, using the literature's exact phrases where possible. Also, check that the MONDO term is accurate. If I can't find the exact term for parkinsonism, using Parkinson's disease might be acceptable, but I should note that. Finally, ensure that the variants are correctly standardized with the right transcript and positions.
