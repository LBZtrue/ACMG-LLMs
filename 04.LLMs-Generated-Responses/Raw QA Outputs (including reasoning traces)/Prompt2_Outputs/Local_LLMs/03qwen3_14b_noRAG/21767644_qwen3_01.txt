Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed context and a JSON structure they want the answer in. First, I need to parse the literature excerpts they've given and extract the necessary information.

Looking at the literature list, there are several papers. Let's go through each one.

Starting with the first paper: "Doxycycline-inducible expression of human α-synuclein in SH-SY5Y cells: a new model for Parkinson's disease." This mentions α-synuclein, but no specific variants. So maybe this isn't relevant for variants. The disease here is Parkinson's disease, but I need to check MONDO for that.

Next, the paper about the A53T mutation in α-synuclein causing familial Parkinson's disease. Here, the variant is A53T. The gene is SNCA. The paper describes this mutation, so that's a variant to include. The disease is Parkinson's disease again.

Another paper: "A novel mutation in the SNCA gene (G209S) associated with Parkinson's disease." This introduces the G209S variant. Need to note that as well.

Then there's the paper on the A30P mutation in α-synuclein and its effect on protein aggregation. This is another variant, A30P. The same gene, SNCA.

The paper on the E46K mutation in α-synuclein and its role in Parkinson's disease. So E46K is another variant.

The last paper is about the LRRK2 G2019S mutation and its role in Parkinson's disease. That's a different gene, LRRK2, with variant G2019S.

Now, for the disease, all these papers relate to Parkinson's disease. I need to check MONDO for the correct term. MONDO:0005041 is Parkinson's disease, I think.

Next, the experimental methods. Each paper probably describes their methods. For example, the first paper uses SH-SY5Y cells with doxycycline-inducible expression. Another paper might use cell culture or animal models. Need to extract the assay methods, materials, readouts, etc.

But the user's example had a Western Blot. However, the papers here might mention different methods. Let me check each paper's abstract or methods section.

First paper: "Doxycycline-inducible expression... new model for Parkinson's disease." Methods likely involve cell culture, maybe immunocytochemistry, western blotting, etc.

Second paper on A53T: They might have used cell models or transgenic mice. The methods could include western blot, immunohistochemistry, behavioral tests.

Third paper on G209S: Similar methods, maybe cell culture, western blot, aggregation assays.

Fourth paper on A30P: Same as above.

Fifth on E46K: Same methods.

Sixth on LRRK2 G2019S: Might use cell lines, animal models, kinase assays, etc.

Each method would need to be listed with their respective details. However, the user's example had a single experiment method, but there might be multiple methods in each paper.

But the user's example was simplified. So perhaps in the answer, each method from each paper is listed as separate entries under "Experiment Method".

Also, the variants need to be standardized via HGVS nomenclature. For example, the A53T mutation in SNCA would be NM_000345.2:c.158C>T (p.A53T). Similarly for G209S: c.626G>A (p.G209S), A30P: c.94C>T (p.A30P), E46K: c.137G>A (p.E46K), LRRK2 G2019S: NM_014617.2:c.6056G>A (p.G2019S).

I need to ensure that the HGVS nomenclature is correct. Maybe using the HGVS standard for each variant.

For the MONDO term, Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005041.

Now, for the experimental methods. Each paper's methods need to be parsed. For example, the first paper might have used cell culture, Western Blot, immunocytochemistry. Each of these would be separate entries under "Experiment Method".

But the user's example had a single method. However, the user might expect each method from each paper to be included. However, without the actual methods sections from the papers, this is challenging. The user provided only titles and abstracts, not full methods. So maybe the answer will have to make assumptions based on common methods in Parkinson's disease research.

Alternatively, the user might have intended to use the example structure but with the actual variants from the papers. Since the example was just a placeholder, perhaps the answer should follow that structure but with the actual data from the provided literature.

Wait, the user provided the list of literature but not the actual methods. Hmm. The challenge here is that without the detailed methods from each paper, it's hard to fill in the "Experiment Method" section. However, the user might have expected that the answer uses the variants from the literature and the disease, but the methods would be inferred or left as N.D. if not specified.

But in the example given by the user, the "Experiment Method" was filled with details. Therefore, perhaps the answer should include the variants and the disease, but the experiment methods might be left with N.D. for some fields, or use common methods.

Alternatively, the user might have intended that the answer only includes the variant and disease parts, and the experiment methods are not present because the literature excerpts don't provide that information. But the user's example included the experiment method, so maybe they expect that even if the methods are not detailed, the answer should have placeholders.

This is a bit of a dilemma. However, given the information provided, the best approach is to extract the variants and the disease, and for the experiment methods, note that the information is not available in the provided literature excerpts, hence mark as N.D. where appropriate.

So, the answer would have the variants listed with their HGVS nomenclature, the disease as Parkinson's disease with MONDO term, and the experiment methods with N.D. for fields not specified in the literature.

But wait, the user's example had specific methods. Maybe the user expects that even if the methods are not detailed in the provided literature, the answer should still include the structure with N.D. where necessary.

Therefore, the final answer would include the variants, the disease with MONDO, and for each experiment method, the fields that are not specified in the literature would be N.D. or left blank, with descriptions as "Not described in the literature".
