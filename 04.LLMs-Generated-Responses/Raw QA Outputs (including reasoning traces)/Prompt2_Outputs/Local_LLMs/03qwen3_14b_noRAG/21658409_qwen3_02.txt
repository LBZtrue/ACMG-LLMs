Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed context and a complex JSON structure they want me to populate based on the literature examples given. The main task is to extract variant information, disease terms from MONDO, and experimental methods with all their details.

First, I need to look through the literature examples provided. Wait, the user didn't actually include the literature examples in the context. They mentioned "Context" but the actual content is just the JSON structure and examples. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to use the example they provided in the "Examples" section as a model. Let me check that again.

In the Examples section, they have an example where the variant is in TP53, c.248G>A (p.G83D), and the disease is Hereditary Myopathy with MONDO:0012345. But the user's actual context might be different. Wait, the user's initial context is the JSON structure and the example. But the actual literature they want me to process isn't provided here. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake and forgot to include the actual literature text. Without the specific literature content, I can't extract the variants or the experimental methods. 

Wait, looking back, the user's initial message includes the context as the JSON structure and examples but no actual literature text. That's confusing. The user might have intended to include the literature text but forgot. Alternatively, maybe they want me to use the example they provided as the input. But the example is just a hypothetical scenario. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is providing a template and wants me to generate a similar structure based on the example. However, without the actual literature content, I can't proceed accurately. But perhaps the user expects me to use the example as the input and generate the output accordingly. Let me check the example again.

In the example, the literature mentions a variant in TP53, c.248G>A (p.G83D), and the disease is Hereditary Myopathy with MONDO:0012345. The experiment method is Western Blot using HEK293 cells. The output JSON is structured as per the user's instructions. 

But the user's actual context might be different. Wait, the user's initial message starts with "Context" but the content is the JSON structure and examples. Maybe the user intended to include the literature text in the context but it's missing. Alternatively, this is a test to see if I can generate the structure based on the example. 

Assuming that the user wants me to use the example provided as the input literature, I can proceed to generate the JSON structure accordingly. However, the user might have intended to include their own literature content. Since it's not present, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants me to process a specific literature text that's referenced in the initial context but not included. Without that, I can't proceed. However, given the example, I can generate an answer based on that. 

Wait, looking at the user's initial message again, the context is just the JSON structure and the example. There's no actual literature content. That seems incomplete. But perhaps the user is asking for a demonstration of how the answer should look, using the example they provided. In that case, I can use the example as the input and generate the JSON accordingly. 

But the user's example is already in the answer section. Maybe the user wants me to process a different example. However, without specific literature content, I can't do that. Perhaps the user made a mistake and the actual literature is missing. 

In this case, since the example is provided, I'll use that as the input literature and generate the JSON structure as per the user's instructions. Even though the example is already in the answer, maybe the user wants to see the process. 

So, based on the example, the variant is TP53 c.248G>A (p.G83D), disease is Hereditary Myopathy with MONDO:0012345, and the experiment method is Western Blot. The JSON structure would be filled accordingly. 

But the user's example already has the answer. Maybe the user is testing if I can follow the structure. However, the user might have intended to include their own literature text, which is missing. 

In conclusion, without the actual literature content, I can't proceed accurately. However, using the example provided, I can generate the answer as per the user's structure. That's the best I can do given the information available.
