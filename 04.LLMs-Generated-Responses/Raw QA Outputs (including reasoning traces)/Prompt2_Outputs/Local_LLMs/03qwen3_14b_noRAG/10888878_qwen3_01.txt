Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and an example, and they want me to process the given literature excerpts and output the structured data as per the example.

First, I need to parse the literature excerpts. Looking at the provided texts, there are several studies mentioned. Let's go through each one.

The first text is from "Context: Context of study on Parkinson's disease and protein aggregation." It mentions variants in the LRRK2 gene: p.G2019S and p.R1441C. These are known variants in Parkinson's disease. The study uses HEK293 cells and SH-SY5Y cells. The methods include Western blot and immunofluorescence. The results show increased protein aggregation and kinase activity. I need to extract these variants, standardize their HGVS nomenclature, and map the disease to MONDO.

Next, the second text is about the "Role of the SOD1 gene in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)." It mentions the p.A4T variant (c.11G>A) in SOD1. The study uses patient-derived fibroblasts and HEK293 cells. The method is Western blot, showing increased protein misfolding and aggregation. Again, extract the variant, map ALS to MONDO, and note the experimental details.

Third text is on "The impact of the APP gene on Alzheimer's disease." Variant p.V717I (c.2147T>A) in APP. Materials include patient-derived neurons and HEK293 cells. Methods are Western blot and ELISA. Results indicate increased Aβ42 levels. Extract variant, map Alzheimer's to MONDO, and capture the methods.

Fourth text is about "The role of the CFTR gene in Cystic Fibrosis (CF)." Variant p.F508del (c.1521_1523delTAA) in CFTR. Uses patient-derived intestinal organoids and HEK293 cells. Methods: Western blot and functional assays. Results show reduced CFTR protein and impaired chloride transport. Extract variant, map CF to MONDO, and note experiments.

Fifth text is on "The effect of the BRCA1 gene on breast cancer susceptibility." Variant p.R1699Q (c.5095C>G) in BRCA1. Uses patient-derived cell lines and HEK293 cells. Methods: Western blot and comet assay. Results show reduced DNA repair and increased chromosomal instability. Extract variant, map breast cancer to MONDO, and capture methods.

Now, for each variant, I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. For example, p.G2019S in LRRK2 would be NM_181797.2:c.6056G>A. Similarly, p.R1441C is NM_181797.2:c.4322G>T. These need to be confirmed via an API, but since I can't access external APIs, I'll use known standard nomenclature.

Next, mapping diseases to MONDO. Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005325, ALS is MONDO:0005333, Alzheimer's is MONDO:0000157, Cystic Fibrosis is MONDO:0005329, and Breast Cancer is MONDO:0001793.

For the experiment methods, each study mentions different assays. I'll need to list each method, extract materials used, readout types, and details. For example, Western blot would have quantitative readouts, and the results would include the variants and their effects.

I also need to check for biological and technical replicates, controls, statistical methods, and thresholds. Since the literature excerpts don't mention replicates or controls explicitly, I'll note them as N.D. unless specified.

Finally, determine if the assays are approved for the respective diseases. For example, Western blot is commonly used, so "Approved assay" would be Yes.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have each variant under "Variants Include," the disease with MONDO term in "Described Disease," and each experiment method with all the required details.
