Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed example of how to structure the JSON output based on a literature excerpt. Now, I need to apply the same process to the given context about DJ-1 and Parkinson's disease.

First, I'll extract the variants. The text mentions "DJ-1 (PARK7) c.107C>T (p.S36L)" and "DJ-1 (PARK7) c.107C>T (p.S36L) variant". The gene is DJ-1, which is also known as PARK7. The variant is c.107C>T leading to p.S36L. I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature using an API. Assuming the standard format is NM_001130623.2:c.107C>T, which corresponds to p.S36L. 

Next, the described disease. The context refers to Parkinson's disease. I'll need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. The correct MONDO term is MONDO:0005123.

Now, listing the experimental methods. The example includes Western Blot, which is mentioned in the context. Also, there's a luciferase reporter assay and a cell survival assay. Each of these needs to be detailed. For each method, I'll extract the material used (like HEK293 cells), readout types (quantitative for Western Blot, luciferase activity for the reporter assay), and the results for the variant. 

For the Western Blot, the result is that the variant shows a 40% reduction in protein expression compared to wild-type. The biological replicates are mentioned as 3, technical replicates as triplicate. Controls include wild-type and empty vector. Statistical analysis is ANOVA. Thresholds for normal and abnormal are based on literature, like 80% and 50% expression. The approved assay for Western Blot in Parkinson's is likely yes.

The luciferase reporter assay shows a 30% decrease in activity. Controls include wild-type and empty vector. The cell survival assay indicates 20% reduced survival. Each of these methods needs their own entry in the Experiment Method array.

I need to make sure all the variants are included in each Readout description. Also, check if all sections are covered: biological and technical replicates, controls, statistical methods, thresholds, and whether the assays are approved for the disease.

Finally, structure all this into the JSON format as per the example, ensuring consistency in the keys and proper nesting.
