Okay, I need to tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and an example, and they want me to process the given literature to extract the required information. Let me start by understanding the context.

First, the literature mentioned is the one from the user's initial input. However, looking back, the user hasn't actually provided the specific literature content. Wait, the original problem statement says "Context" but the user hasn't included the actual text of the literature. Hmm, that's a problem. Without the literature content, I can't extract the variants, the disease, or the experimental methods.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user's initial input is the context, but they didn't paste the actual paper or text. The answer example is given, but that's just an example. The user might have intended to provide the literature content but forgot. Without that, I can't proceed. 

But maybe the user expects me to use the example they provided as the literature? Let me check the example again. The example mentions a variant in TP53, disease Hereditary Myopathy, and MONDO term. But that's just an example. The actual answer requires processing the user's own literature. However, since the user hasn't provided the actual text, I can't extract the necessary information. 

This seems like a mistake. The user might have intended to include the literature text but forgot. Alternatively, maybe this is a test to see if I can handle such scenarios. In that case, I should inform the user that the literature content is missing and can't proceed without it. However, since the user provided an example, perhaps they want me to use that example as the input literature. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the list of references provided in the initial context, but looking back, the context is just a list of references (like the ones from Context 1 to 4). Those are just citation examples, not the actual text of the literature. 

In this case, without the actual literature content, it's impossible to extract the required data. The user might have made an error in not including the necessary text. Therefore, the correct response would be to point out that the literature content is missing and can't be processed. However, since the user provided an example, maybe they want me to use that as the input. 

But the example is just an example, not the actual literature. Therefore, I need to inform the user that the literature content is missing and can't proceed. Alternatively, if the user intended to provide the literature in the initial context but forgot, I should ask for clarification. 

Given the instructions, I should proceed based on the example provided. However, the example is not part of the literature but a sample. Therefore, I can't generate a valid answer without the actual literature. 

Wait, looking back at the user's message, the initial context is the list of references from Context 1 to 4, but those are just examples of references, not the actual content of the papers. Therefore, there's no literature provided. 

In conclusion, the user hasn't provided the necessary literature content to extract the variants, disease, or experimental methods. Without that, I can't generate the required JSON. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the literature content is missing and can't be processed.

The provided context does not include the actual literature content or experimental data required to extract variants, diseases, or experimental methods. Without the specific text of the study (e.g., descriptions of variants, materials, assays, controls, or results), it is impossible to populate the JSON structure as requested. Please provide the full text of the literature or the relevant sections to proceed.
