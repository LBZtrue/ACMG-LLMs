Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and example, so I need to make sure I follow the same format. First, I need to extract all the variant information from the literature they mentioned.

Looking at the literature provided, there are a few papers mentioned. Let's check each one:

1. **Spirin et al., 2020** mentions the variant **Ala105Thr** in the **ATP13A2** gene. The description is "A105T (Ala105Thr)" and "Ala105Thr (A105T)".

2. **Dai et al., 2020** refers to the variant **Glu185Lys** in **ATP13A2** as "E185K (Glu185Lys)".

3. **Hui et al., 2020** discusses **Arg236Trp** in **ATP13A2**, described as "R236W (Arg236Trp)".

4. **Li et al., 2020** talks about **Glu185Lys** in **ATP13A2** again, same as Dai et al.

5. **Zhang et al., 2020** mentions **Glu185Lys** again.

6. **Wang et al., 2020** refers to **Glu185Lys** once more.

7. **Chen et al., 2020** discusses **Arg236Trp** again.

8. **Xie et al., 2021** mentions **Glu185Lys** again.

Now, I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. The user mentioned using an API, but since I can't access external APIs, I'll have to rely on standard conventions. For example, the variant Ala105Thr would be **NM_001156435.3:c.314C>A** (assuming the transcript is correct). However, without the exact transcript ID, this might be an approximation. But the user's example didn't specify the transcript, so maybe they expect the variant to be listed as is, but with proper HGVS format. However, in the example, they used a specific transcript, so perhaps I need to find the correct transcript for ATP13A2.

Wait, the example used "NM_001126112.3" for TP53. For ATP13A2, the main transcript is likely NM_001156435.3. So I'll use that as the transcript ID.

Next, the disease. The literature mentions Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's. MONDO:0005404 is the term for Parkinson's disease.

Now, for the experimental methods. Each study mentions different methods. For example, Spirin et al. used HEK293 cells, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Each method needs to be listed with their respective materials, readouts, controls, etc.

But the user's example only had one method per entry, so I need to create separate entries for each method. However, in the provided literature, some studies might have multiple methods. For instance, Spirin et al. might have used both Western blot and immunofluorescence. Each of these would be a separate entry in the Experiment Method array.

Also, the Readout description needs to include all variants mentioned in the Variants Include section. Since there are multiple variants (A105T, E185K, R236W), each experiment method's Readout description should list all these variants and their corresponding conclusions and molecular effects.

However, the literature doesn't provide specific experimental results for each variant in each study. The example had specific results, but the actual literature here is more about the variants and their association with the disease, not the experimental outcomes. This might be a problem because the user's example had detailed experimental results, but the provided literature here is more about variant discovery and association rather than functional assays.

Wait, looking back, the user's example had an experiment method with specific results, like protein expression reduction. But in the actual literature provided, the studies might be more about variant identification, not functional experiments. This could mean that the Experiment Method section might be sparse or require inference.

But the user's instruction says to list all experimental methods mentioned in the literature. So even if the literature doesn't provide detailed results, I need to extract what's there. However, the example had detailed results, so maybe the user expects that even if the literature doesn't have explicit results, I should infer based on the variant's effect as described in the literature.

For example, in the literature, the variants are described as being associated with Parkinson's disease, so the molecular effect might be "pathogenic" or "likely pathogenic". However, the user's example had more specific effects like "partial loss-of-function". Since the literature here doesn't provide such specifics, I might need to use "N.D." (not determined) for the molecular effect and "Abnormal" for the conclusion if the variant is associated with the disease.

But this is a bit ambiguous. The user's example had specific results, but the actual literature here may not. So perhaps I need to mention that the experiments were conducted to assess the variants' effects, but the specific results aren't detailed in the literature provided. However, the user might expect that the examples from the literature are used to fill in the Readout description even if the details are not explicit.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the variants listed in the Variants Include section are from the literature, and the Experiment Method section should reflect the methods used to study those variants, even if the results aren't detailed. In that case, the Readout description would need to be based on the literature's descriptions, which might be limited.

This is a bit of a challenge. Since the user's example had detailed results, but the actual literature provided doesn't have that level of detail, perhaps the answer should reflect that the results are not explicitly mentioned, and use "N.D." where necessary.

Another point: the user's example had multiple entries in the Experiment Method array, each with different assay methods. In the provided literature, each study might have used different methods. For example, Spirin et al. used HEK293 cells, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Each of these would be separate entries in the Experiment Method array.

Putting it all together, the Variants Include section would list all three variants (A105T, E185K, R236W) with their HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions from the literature.

The Described Disease would be Parkinson's disease with the MONDO term MONDO:0005404.

The Experiment Method section would list each method used in the studies, such as Western blot, immunofluorescence, etc., with materials from HEK293 cells, readout types as quantitative or qualitative, and Readout descriptions including the variants. However, since the literature doesn't provide detailed results, the molecular effect and result descriptions might be "N.D." or inferred based on the variant's association with the disease.

But the user's example had specific results, so I need to ensure that even if the literature doesn't have them, the answer follows the structure. However, the literature here doesn't provide such details, which might be a problem. Perhaps the user expects that the variants are listed, and the experiments are mentioned, but the results are not detailed, so they are marked as N.D.

This is a bit of a dilemma. The user's example had detailed results, but the actual literature provided here is more about variant identification and association rather than functional experiments. Therefore, the Experiment Method section might not have detailed results, but the user might still expect the structure to be filled with what's available, even if it's minimal.
