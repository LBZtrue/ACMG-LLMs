Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract variant information, standardize HGVS nomenclature, identify the disease using MONDO, and detail the experimental methods from the provided literature. The example given is for a TP53 variant in Hereditary Myopathy, but the actual literature here is about LRRK2 and Parkinson's disease. 

First, I need to parse the literature for variants. Looking at the references, the first paper mentions a missense variant in LRRK2, specifically p.G2019S. The HGVS nomenclature is given as NM_181797.2:c.6056A>G. I need to standardize this using an API, but since I can't access external tools, I'll assume the given HGVS is correct.

Next, the disease. The first paper discusses Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's. From my knowledge, the MONDO ID is MONDO:0005256.

Then, the experimental methods. The first paper uses HEK293 cells, and the method is Western blot. The result shows that the G2019S variant leads to increased kinase activity. The readout is quantitative, and the conclusion is abnormal with a gain-of-function effect. They mention technical and biological replicates, but the description in the literature doesn't specify the number of replicates, so I'll put "N.D." unless stated. The controls are wild-type and empty vector. The statistical method is not mentioned, so I'll use "N.D." for that. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren't provided in the text, so I'll have to use a standard based on my knowledge, like protein expression levels.

The second paper also discusses the LRRK2 G2019S variant and uses the same method but with SH-SY5Y cells. The result is similar, but the control might be different. The third paper talks about a different variant, R1441C, and uses a different method like kinase assays. I need to check each paper for variants and methods.

I need to make sure each variant is correctly associated with its HGVS, cDNA, and protein changes. For example, R1441C would be NM_181797.2:c.4322G>T, leading to p.R1441C. 

For the MONDO term, Parkinson's disease is indeed MONDO:0005256. 

In the experiment methods, each paper might have different materials and controls. I'll need to list each method separately, even if they're the same, as different papers might have different details. 

I should also check if the experimental methods are generally used for studying Parkinson's. Western blot is commonly used, so Approved assay would be "Yes". Kinase assays are also standard, so "Yes" as well.

Now, compiling all this into the JSON structure as per the example. Each variant under "Variants Include" should have the correct HGVS, cDNA, and protein changes. The disease section with MONDO. Each experiment method with all the details, including readout descriptions linking back to the variants, replicates, controls, and approved status.

I need to make sure that the "Readout description" in each experiment method includes all variants from "Variants Include", even if they are from different papers. However, looking at the literature provided, the three papers mention different variants (G2019S, R1441C, and others). So each variant should have its own entry in "Variants Include", and each experiment method should reference the appropriate variants.

Wait, the user's example has one variant in "Variants Include" and one experiment method. But in the actual literature, there are multiple variants and multiple methods. So I need to list each variant and each method separately. For example, if two papers discuss the same variant but different methods, each method is a separate entry under "Experiment Method".

Also, for the "Validation controls P/LP" and "B/LB", the literature doesn't mention them, so those should be "N.D." with counts as 0 unless specified.

Thresholds for normal and abnormal readout: since the literature doesn't specify, I'll use a standard based on my knowledge. For example, kinase activity above a certain level is normal, below is abnormal.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have multiple variants and multiple experiment methods, each with their details.
