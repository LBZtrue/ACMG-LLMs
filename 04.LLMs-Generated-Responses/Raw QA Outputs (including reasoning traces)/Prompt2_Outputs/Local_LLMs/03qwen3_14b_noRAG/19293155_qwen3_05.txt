Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They provided a detailed JSON structure and example for extracting variant and experiment information from a literature context. The user wants me to process the given context and generate the corresponding JSON output.

First, I need to parse the literature context to identify any genetic variants mentioned. The example given in the query mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, but the actual context provided here is different. Wait, the user hasn't provided the actual literature content. Hmm, looking back at the user's message, the context section is empty. That's a problem because without the actual literature text, I can't extract the variants or experiment details.

Wait, the user might have intended to include the literature context but forgot. In the initial problem statement, the user might have pasted the example but not the actual context. Let me check again. The user's message starts with "Context:" but then there's nothing under it. That's an issue. Without the specific literature content, I can't extract the required information like gene names, variants, diseases, or experimental methods.

In the absence of the actual literature text, I can't proceed to extract the necessary data. The user might have made a mistake here. However, looking at the example they provided, they have a sample with TP53 and Hereditary Myopathy. But since the user's provided context is empty, I can't generate the correct JSON. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is testing if I can handle the example structure without the actual context. But that doesn't make sense. The user needs to provide the literature content for processing. Since the context is missing, I can't extract any variants or experimental methods. 

Wait, maybe the user intended to include the literature context but it's not present. In that case, I should inform them that the context is missing and request the necessary information. However, looking at the initial problem again, the user's message is a query for the assistant to process, but without the actual context, it's impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the user included the literature context in the example but not in the main query. But no, the example is separate. 

In conclusion, without the actual literature content, I can't generate the required JSON. The user needs to provide the specific text from the literature that contains the genetic variants, disease information, and experimental methods. Once that is provided, I can extract the details, standardize the HGVS nomenclature, retrieve the MONDO term, and structure the JSON as per the example.

The provided context is empty, and no literature content has been included for analysis. To proceed with the requested task, the actual text of the scientific literature containing genetic variants, experimental methods, and disease information must be provided. Without this information, it is impossible to extract and structure the required JSON output.

Please provide the specific literature content (e.g., a paragraph or excerpt from a research paper) that includes:
1. Genetic variants (e.g., gene names, nucleotide changes, protein effects).
2. The disease or condition being studied.
3. Experimental methods (e.g., assays, materials, controls, statistical analyses).

Once the context is provided, I will process it according to the outlined workflow and generate the structured JSON output.
