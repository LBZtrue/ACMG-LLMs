Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and examples, and they want the assistant to extract information from the given literature and format it accordingly. 

First, I need to parse the literature provided. Looking through the references, most of them are about LRRK2 and Parkinson's disease. The key variant mentioned is I2020T in LRRK2. Let me check each paper to see if this variant is discussed.

In the first paper (PMID: 28404534), the abstract mentions that the I2020T variant in LRRK2 is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. The study uses SH-SY5Y cells and a luciferase reporter assay to show that this variant enhances the transcriptional activity of the LRRK2 promoter. So here, the variant is I2020T, and the disease is Parkinson's. 

Next, the second paper (PMID: 28724652) also discusses the I2020T variant in the context of LRRK2 and Parkinson's disease. They used HEK293 cells and found that the variant increases the kinase activity of LRRK2. The method here is kinase assays, and the conclusion is that the variant has a gain-of-function effect.

The ninetieth-ninth paper (PMID: 28724652) is the same. The one-hundredth paper (PMID: 28724652) is the same. 

Wait, I see that most of the papers are duplicates, specifically PMID: 28724652 repeated multiple times. That's probably an error in the input. But the first paper is unique, and the rest are the same. So, the variant is I2020T in LRRK2, associated with Parkinson's disease. 

Now, the user wants the JSON structure. Let me start with the variants section. The variant is I2020T in LRRK2. The position is 2020 in the LRRK2 gene. The effect is gain-of-function, as per the second paper. The study in the first paper mentions increased transcriptional activity. The second paper's method is kinase assays showing increased kinase activity. 

For the experiments, the first paper uses SH-SY5Y cells and a luciferase reporter assay. The second paper uses HEK293 cells and kinase assays. 

The disease is Parkinson's, and the MONDO ID for Parkinson's is MONDO:0005253. 

Now, the JSON structure. Let me check the example provided. The example has a variants array with each variant, then experiments, and disease. 

So, the variants array would have one entry: LRRK2 with variant I2020T, position 2020, effect gain-of-function. Then experiments: first entry with cell line SH-SY5Y, method luciferase reporter assay, result increased transcriptional activity. Second entry with cell line HEK293, method kinase assay, result increased kinase activity. 

The disease section would have MONDO ID MONDO:0005253 and name Parkinson's disease. 

I need to make sure all the required fields are present. Also, the user mentioned that the variant should be in the format gene:variant, so LRRK2:I2020T. The position is 2020, which is the amino acid position. 

I think that's all. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.
