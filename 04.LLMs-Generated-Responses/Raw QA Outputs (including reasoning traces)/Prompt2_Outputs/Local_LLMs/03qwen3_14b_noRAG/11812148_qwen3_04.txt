Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to parse the user's query and understand the requirements. They provided a detailed JSON structure and an example, so the goal is to extract information from the given literature and structure it accordingly.

Looking at the literature provided, it's a list of references with authors, years, and titles. However, the actual content of the studies isn't detailed here. The user probably expects me to extract variant information, disease terms, and experimental methods from the literature. But wait, the literature mentioned here only has titles and authors. There's no mention of specific variants, genes, or experimental methods in the provided text. 

Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake and forgot to include the actual content of the literature. The example they provided had specific details about a variant in TP53 and the disease Hereditary Myopathy. But in the current query, the literature entries are just titles. Without the actual content, I can't extract the required information like variants, genes, or experimental methods. 

Wait, perhaps the user intended to include the full text of the literature but forgot. Alternatively, maybe they want me to use the titles to infer the disease and variants. But that's not feasible. The titles are about alpha-synuclein, Parkinson's disease, and other topics, but they don't mention specific genes or variants. 

In the example, the disease was Hereditary Myopathy with a MONDO term. But in the given literature, the diseases mentioned are Parkinson's disease and others. However, without specific variant details, I can't map them to the JSON structure. 

So, the problem here is that the literature provided doesn't have the necessary details. The user might have intended to provide the full text, but in the current state, it's impossible to extract the required information. Therefore, the answer would have to indicate that the literature doesn't contain the necessary data to populate the JSON structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to recognize that the literature titles are related to the disease, but without explicit information on variants or experiments, I can't proceed. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0019028, but again, without the actual content, I can't confirm that. 

In conclusion, the answer should state that the provided literature lacks the necessary details (variants, experimental methods, etc.) to fulfill the JSON structure. Therefore, the information cannot be extracted as required.

The provided literature does not contain the necessary detailed information (e.g., specific genetic variants, experimental methods, or molecular effects) to populate the required JSON structure. The entries listed are only titles and authors of studies, with no explicit mention of variants, genes, or experimental protocols. As a result, it is not possible to extract and organize the data into the specified framework.

**Answer:**
```json
{
  "Variants Include": [],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "N.D.",
    "MONDO": "N.D."
  },
  "Experiment Method": []
}
```
