Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to parse the given literature and extract all the variant information, disease details, and experimental methods into a structured JSON format as per their specified schema. 

First, I need to read through the provided literature. Wait, the user didn't actually include the literature text. Oh, wait, looking back, the user provided the context as the list of papers, but the actual text of the literature isn't here. Hmm, this is a problem. The example they gave had a specific literature excerpt, but in the current query, the user only lists the papers in the context. 

Wait, looking at the initial message, the user's context is the list of papers, but the actual content of each paper isn't provided. That's a problem because without the actual text of the papers, I can't extract the variants, diseases, or experimental methods. The example they gave included a sample literature excerpt, but in the current query, there's no such text. 

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The user's message starts with "Context: [list of papers]" but doesn't include the actual content of those papers. So, without the actual text, I can't extract the information. But the user provided an example where the literature mentions a variant in TP53, etc. However, in the current query, the user hasn't provided the actual text of the literature. 

This is a critical issue. The user might have intended to include the literature text but forgot. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the example they provided as the literature. But in the example, the literature mentions TP53 and Hereditary Myopathy, but in the current query, the context is different. 

Wait, the user's context here is the list of papers from the initial problem. But the actual content of each paper is not provided. Therefore, I can't proceed without that information. However, the user might have made a mistake and forgot to include the literature text. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting me to use the example they provided as the literature. But in that case, the example is just an example, not the actual literature. 

This is confusing. Without the actual text of the literature, I can't extract the variants, diseases, or experimental methods. Therefore, the answer would be that the necessary information is missing. However, the user might have intended to provide the literature in the context but didn't. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is testing if I can handle such a scenario. In that case, I should point out that the literature text is missing and that I can't proceed without it. 

But looking back, the user's initial message includes the context as the list of papers, but no actual content. Therefore, the answer would have to be that the literature text is missing. However, the user might have intended to include the literature in the context but forgot. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the example provided, and the actual literature is the same as the example. But that's not clear. 

Given this confusion, I think the correct approach is to inform the user that the literature text is missing and that without it, the task cannot be completed. However, the user might have intended to include the literature in the context, so I need to check again. 

Wait, looking at the user's message again, the context is the list of papers, but the actual content of each paper is not provided. Therefore, the answer would need to state that the necessary information is missing. 

But the user might have made a mistake in not including the literature text. Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting me to use the example as the literature. However, the example is just an example, not the actual data. 

In conclusion, without the actual text of the literature, I can't extract the required information. Therefore, I should point out that the literature text is missing and that the task cannot be completed as is.

The provided context lists the titles of research papers but does not include the full text of any literature. Without the actual content of the papers, it is impossible to extract variant information, disease details, or experimental methods as required. The task cannot be completed without the textual content of the literature. 

**Answer:**  
```json
{
  "Variants Include": [],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "N/A",
    "MONDO": "N/A"
  },
  "Experiment Method": []
}
```  

**Note:** The above JSON structure is empty because the required literature content (e.g., variant descriptions, disease names, experimental methods) is missing from the context. Please provide the full text of the papers to proceed.
