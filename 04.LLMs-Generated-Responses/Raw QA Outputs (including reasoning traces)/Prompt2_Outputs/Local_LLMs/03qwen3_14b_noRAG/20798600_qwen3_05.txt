Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and examples, asking for the extraction and standardization of variant information, disease terms from MONDO, and experimental methods from the given literature. 

First, I need to parse the literature provided. Looking at the context, the user mentioned several papers with references like Context:1, Context:2, etc. Each of these likely discusses variants in the PINK1 gene related to Parkinson's disease. For example, Context:1 mentions "c.695G>A (p.G232D)" and "c.946C>T (p.R316W)" in PINK1, linked to Parkinson's disease. 

Next, I'll need to extract the gene names, HGVS notations, cDNA changes, and protein changes. Then, standardize the HGVS using an API. However, since I can't access external APIs, I'll assume the HGVS is already correct or note that standardization might be needed. 

For the disease, Parkinson's disease has a MONDO term. I'll check MONDO to find the correct ID, which is likely MONDO:0005014. 

Now, the experimental methods. Each context entry describes different assays: e.g., Western blot, mitochondrial function assays, cellular respiration assays, etc. For each method, I need to extract material sources, readout types, descriptions, replicates, controls, statistical methods, thresholds, and whether the assay is approved for the disease.

I need to ensure that each variant in the "Variants Include" section is matched with the corresponding experimental results in "Readout description". For example, if a variant is tested in a Western blot, the result should be listed under that assay's Readout description with the variant's HGVS, conclusion, molecular effect, and result description.

Also, check for replicates, controls, and statistical methods mentioned in each context. If not specified, use "N.D." or infer based on standard practices. For "Approved assay", determine if the method is commonly used for Parkinson's research. Western blot is standard, so "Yes" applies.

Finally, structure all this into the JSON format as per the example, ensuring all fields are filled accurately based on the literature provided.
