Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and examples, and they want me to extract information from the given literature context. First, I need to parse the literature content to find any mentions of genetic variants, the associated disease, and the experimental methods used.

Looking at the literature context, there are several references to the PARK2 gene and variants like c.1007G>A (p.G336D), c.1097G>A (p.G366D), and c.1099G>A (p.G367D). These are all missense mutations in the PARK2 gene. The disease mentioned is Parkinson's disease, which I need to confirm with the MONDO database. The MONDO ID for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005132.

Next, the experimental methods. The literature mentions overexpression and knockdown experiments in HEK293 cells. For each variant, they observed effects on ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The methods include Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and proteasomal degradation assays. However, the details about replicates, controls, and statistical methods are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. I need to infer based on standard practices if they're not present.

For the variants, I'll map each to their HGVS nomenclature, ensuring they're standardized. The cDNA and protein changes are provided in the context. The description in the input context will include the variant notation and the effect observed.

In the experiment methods section, each assay (Western blot, immunoprecipitation, proteasomal degradation) will be listed. Since the original text doesn't mention replicates or controls, I'll set those fields to N.D. unless I can infer from standard protocols. For example, Western blot typically has technical replicates, but biological replicates might be implied if multiple cell lines or experiments are mentioned. However, the provided text doesn't specify, so I'll stick with N.D. unless stated.

The approved assay field requires determining if these methods are commonly used for Parkinson's disease. Western blot and immunoprecipitation are standard in studying protein interactions and degradation, so I'll mark them as Yes.

I need to make sure all fields in the JSON structure are filled, even if some information is missing. For thresholds, since they're not mentioned, I'll use the "Custom" source with standard thresholds, like a 50% change in protein levels being abnormal.

Finally, compiling all this into the JSON structure as per the example, ensuring consistency with the provided schema.
