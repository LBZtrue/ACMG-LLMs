Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and examples, but the main content is a block of text that seems to be a mix of numbers and possibly some data. Wait, looking again, the user's input is actually a block of numbers and symbols, but maybe that's just a placeholder or an error. However, the user also included a sample input and output, so perhaps they intended to use that as the context for extracting the information.

Wait, no, the user's input is the block of numbers after the initial context. But that doesn't make sense. Let me check again. The user's message starts with "Context:" followed by a block of numbers and symbols. Then they provided an example. Maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the data. Alternatively, the numbers might be part of a table or data that's not properly formatted.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to provide a scientific paper's data, but it's presented as a series of numbers. However, without proper context, it's hard to extract the necessary information. The example given by the user is about a variant in TP53, so maybe the actual data they want to process is similar, but the numbers are not clear.

Wait, the user's input after the initial context is a block of numbers, which might be a mistake. Maybe they meant to paste a scientific paper's data but it's not properly formatted. Since the example is provided, perhaps the user wants to see how the JSON is structured based on that example, but the actual data is missing.

Alternatively, the user might have intended to provide a scientific paper's data in a different format, but due to a formatting error, it's presented as numbers. In that case, I need to inform the user that the input data is not properly formatted and cannot be processed. However, the user might have intended to use the example as the input, and the numbers are a mistake.

Given the ambiguity, the best approach is to inform the user that the input data is not properly formatted or missing, and request clarification. However, since the user provided an example, perhaps they want to see the JSON structure applied to that example. But in the example, the input is a description of a variant and disease, which is different from the numbers provided.

Wait, looking back, the user's message starts with "Context:" followed by a block of numbers and symbols. Then they provided an example. This suggests that the user might have pasted the wrong data. The correct input should be the scientific text with variants and experiments, but instead, they have numbers. Therefore, the answer is that the input is not properly formatted and cannot be processed. However, the user might have intended to use the example as the input, so I can use that to generate the JSON structure as shown in the example.

The input data provided is not properly formatted or contains incomplete information that cannot be parsed into the required JSON structure. Specifically, the "Context" section appears to be a block of numbers/symbols without clear scientific or experimental context, making it impossible to extract gene variants, disease information, or experimental methods. 

To proceed, please provide a well-structured scientific text or data that includes:
1. **Gene variants** (e.g., "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" in the TP53 gene).
2. **Disease context** (e.g., "Hereditary Myopathy" with a MONDO term).
3. **Experimental methods** (e.g., "Western Blot" with material sources, controls, and results).

Once this information is provided, I can generate the required JSON output as demonstrated in the example.
