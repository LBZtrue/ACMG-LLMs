Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed JSON structure and examples for extracting variant and experiment information from scientific literature. The main goal is to parse the given literature, extract relevant data, standardize the HGVS nomenclature, retrieve MONDO disease terms, and structure all the information into the specified JSON format.

First, I need to look at the literature examples provided. Let's check each paper:

1. **Valente et al. (2010)**: This paper mentions a PINK1 mutation in a family with early-onset Parkinson's disease. The variant is c.1100G>A (p.Arg367His). The disease is Parkinson's disease, which has a MONDO term (MONDO:0005124). The experiment method here is not explicitly detailed in the context, but the example might be using Western blot or similar methods. However, the user's input doesn't mention specific experiments for this paper, so maybe we need to check others.

2. **Valente et al. (2011)**: This paper discusses the PINK1 gene and its role in Parkinson's disease. The variant is c.1100G>A (p.Arg367His). The experiment methods here are not detailed in the user's input.

3. **Zhou et al. (2013)**: This study mentions a PINK1 mutation in a Chinese patient with Parkinson's disease, c.1100G>A (p.Arg367His). Again, the experiment methods aren't detailed here.

4. **Sato et al. (2014)**: This paper reports a PINK1 mutation in a Japanese patient with Parkinson's disease, c.1100G>A (p.Arg367His). No experiment methods mentioned.

5. **Li et al. (2018)**: This study discusses the PINK1 mutation in a Chinese patient, c.1100G>A (p.Arg367His). No experiment methods provided.

6. **Zhang et al. (2020)**: This paper mentions a PINK1 mutation in a Chinese patient with Parkinson's disease, c.1100G>A (p.Arg367His). No experiment methods.

From the examples, it seems that the variant c.1100G>A (p.Arg367His) is repeatedly mentioned in different studies related to Parkinson's disease. However, the user's input does not explicitly describe any experiment methods for these variants. The example given in the user's request includes a Western Blot experiment, but in the provided literature excerpts, there's no mention of specific experimental methods.

Wait, but in the user's input, the examples are hypothetical. So, perhaps the user is asking to create a JSON based on the example given, even if the actual literature doesn't have the experiment details. However, the user's instruction says to extract information from the literature provided. But looking at the literature excerpts, there's no mention of specific experiments. The only mention is about the variant and the disease.

This is a bit confusing. The user's example includes a Western Blot method, but the actual literature excerpts here don't have any experiment methods. So maybe the user expects that even if the literature doesn't have experiment details, we need to infer or use a default structure? But the user's instruction says to extract from the literature. However, in the given literature, there's no experiment method described.

Wait, looking back at the user's input, the literature examples are from different studies, but none of them mention specific experiments. The user's example in the JSON structure includes a Western Blot experiment, but that's just an example. The actual task is to extract from the provided literature, but the provided literature doesn't have experiment details. Therefore, perhaps the answer should note that no experiment methods are described in the literature provided, leading to the "Experiment Method" section being empty or N.D.

But the user's example includes a filled-out Experiment Method. However, in the actual literature excerpts provided, there's no mention of experiments. Therefore, the correct answer would have to indicate that no experiment methods are described in the literature, hence the "Experiment Method" array would be empty or have entries with N.D. for each field.

But the user's example includes a filled-out Experiment Method. However, the user's instruction says to extract from the literature. Since the literature here doesn't have experiment methods, the answer should reflect that. However, the user might have made a mistake in the example, or perhaps the literature excerpts are incomplete.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that even if the literature doesn't mention experiments, the answer should still follow the structure, filling in N.D. where necessary. For example, in the "Experiment Method" section, each field would have "N.D." with no description.

But the user's example shows a filled-out Experiment Method. However, in the actual literature provided, there's no experiment method. Therefore, the answer would have to reflect that the "Experiment Method" section is empty or has N.D. entries.

But the user's example is hypothetical. So, perhaps the answer should follow the structure even if some fields are N.D.

In conclusion, the answer should extract the variant information (PINK1 c.1100G>A p.Arg367His), map Parkinson's disease to MONDO:0005124, and for the Experiment Method, since no experiments are described in the literature, each field under Experiment Method would be N.D. with no description.
