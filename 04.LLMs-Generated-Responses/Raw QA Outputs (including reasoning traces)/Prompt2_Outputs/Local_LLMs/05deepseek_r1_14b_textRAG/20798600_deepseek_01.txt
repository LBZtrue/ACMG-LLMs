Alright, I need to figure out how to extract the necessary information from the given literature context and structure it into the required JSON format. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll look for any genetic variants mentioned in the article. The title mentions "PD-associated mutations," referring to Parkinson's disease. However, the abstract doesn't provide specific details about individual variants or their HGVS nomenclature. It talks about PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy being compromised by PD-associated mutations but doesn't list any particular mutations.

Next, I'll check if there are any experimental methods described. The article is a brief report, so it's likely concise. The abstract mentions that the study was conducted, but without specifics on materials, readouts, replicates, controls, or statistical methods. Therefore, all these fields would be "N.D." since they aren't provided.

Regarding the disease studied, the literature clearly refers to Parkinson's disease (PD). I'll need to retrieve the corresponding MONDO term for PD. From my knowledge, MONDO terms are standardized, and PD is typically classified under a specific term like MONDO:001647958 or similar. However, without an exact lookup, I might not have the precise code, so it's safer to note that as "N.D." for now.

Since no variants were explicitly mentioned in the literature provided, the "Variants Include" section will be empty. Similarly, there's no detailed description of experimental methods, so all related fields under "Experiment Method" will also be marked as "N.D."

In summary, the JSON structure will have an empty "Variants Include," a disease entry with Parkinson's and MONDO term (though I can't provide the exact code without checking), and an empty "Experiment Method" section due to insufficient details in the provided abstract.

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Parkinson disease",
        "MONDO": "N.D."
    },
    "Experiment Method": []
}
```
