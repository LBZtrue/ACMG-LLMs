Okay, so I need to extract information from the provided scientific literature and structure it according to the given JSON template. Let's start by carefully reading through the article.

First, looking at the variants mentioned in the abstract and introduction sections. The article discusses two mutations: I2020T and G2019S in LRRK2. 

For I2020T:
- It's a missense mutation.
- In terms of cDNA, it's likely something like c.6071T>A (but since the exact position isn't given, maybe we can infer based on standard nomenclature).
- The protein change is from Ile to Thr at position 2020.

For G2019S:
- Another missense mutation.
- cDNA might be around position 6057 (assuming similar length transcripts), but exact number isn't given.
- Protein change: Gly to Ser at position 2019.

Next, the disease studied is Parkinson’s disease. I'll need to find the corresponding MONDO term. MONDO terms for PD are typically like MONDO_0003847.

Now, looking into the experimental methods. The article mentions binding assays and kinase activity assays. 

For material used:
- It's likely in vitro with cell lines or recombinant proteins since it's an invitro study.
- No specific cell line is mentioned beyond "in vitro", so I'll note that as "In vitro (recombinant protein)".

Readout type: Both binding and enzymatic assays are quantitative, measuring ATP affinity and kinase activity.

Each variant was tested in these assays. For example, G2019S had lower ATP affinity and higher sensitivity to inhibitors, while I2020T was more resistant.

Regarding replicates, the article doesn't mention biological or technical replicates explicitly, so both will be marked as N.D.

Controls: The study uses wild-type LRRK2 as a positive control but doesn't mention negative controls beyond that. Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) might not be part of this specific experiment since it's focused on functional assays rather than validation of variants' pathogenicity.

Statistical methods aren't detailed, so they'll be N.D.

Thresholds: Since the study focuses on quantifying ATP affinity and kinase activity changes, thresholds would be based on literature or custom as needed. For example, a significant change might be a 50% reduction in activity being considered abnormal.

Approved assay: Yes, binding and kinase assays are standard for studying enzyme function in diseases like PD.
