Okay, I need to extract information from the provided scientific literature about a-synuclein variants and their relation to Parkinson’s disease. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the abstract and introduction of the paper. The study focuses on the A30P mutation in a-synuclein (aS). They compared wild-type and mutant forms regarding their aggregation properties and amyloid fibril structure. 

So, under "Variants Include," I'll list aS as the gene. The variant is A30P. Since it's an amino acid change from alanine to proline at position 30, the HGVS nomenclature would be something like NM_[appropriate transcript]:c.30A>P. But wait, I need to look up the correct transcript ID for a-synuclein. Maybe it's NM_001126112.3 or another version? For the sake of this exercise, I'll assume it's that one.

The cDNA change would be from A (alanine) to P (proline). The protein change is also at position 30 since it's a missense mutation. 

In "Described Disease," Parkinson’s disease is studied. I need the MONDO term for PD, which I believe is MONDO:0001597.

Looking at experimental methods, they used quenched hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with NMR spectroscopy and 2D proton-detected high-resolution magic angle spinning experiments. So "Assay Method" includes these techniques.

The material source isn't explicitly mentioned, but the samples are likely recombinant aS proteins from in vitro studies. The readout type is quantitative since they're analyzing structural dynamics.

Readout description should mention both wild-type and A30P variants, as the study compares them. So for each variant (wild-type and A30P), their conclusions would be about whether there are structural changes or not.

Biological replicates aren't mentioned in the abstract, so probably N.D. Same with technical replicates. Controls: they compared mutant to wild-type, but basic positive/negative controls aren't described here. No mention of validation controls either. Statistical methods? Not specified in the provided text.

Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren’t given since it's a structural study, not a diagnostic assay. So thresholds might be N.D., but I'm not entirely sure. Since they found no change in structure despite increased pathogenicity, maybe the threshold is based on expected amyloid properties.

Approved assay: Yes, as these are standard techniques for studying protein structures and aggregation.
