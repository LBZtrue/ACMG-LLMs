Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract and structure the information from this scientific literature about PINK1 and its role in protecting against oxidative stress. The user wants me to act as a professional literature miner and data standardization expert, so I need to make sure I follow all their instructions carefully.

First, looking at the provided context, it's an article titled "PINK1 Protects against Oxidative Stress by Phosphorylating Mitochondrial Chaperone TRAP1." The authors are Julia W. Pridgeon and others from Emory University. The study focuses on PINK1 mutations causing autosomal recessive Parkinson disease (PD) and identifies TRAP1 as a substrate for PINK1 kinase.

The user wants the information structured in JSON, so I need to extract all relevant variant info, disease terms, experimental methods, and their details. They also emphasized standardizing HGVS nomenclature via APIs and retrieving MONDO terms.

Starting with variants: The article mentions PD-linked mutations in PINK1 including G309D, L347P, and W437X. So the gene is PINK1, and these are missense or truncating mutations.

Next, for each variant:
- G309D: This is a missense mutation changing glycine to aspartic acid at position 309.
- L347P: Another missense, leucine to proline at position 347.
- W437X: Truncating mutation (nonsense) causing premature stop at position 437.

I need to standardize their HGVS nomenclature. For each variant:
1. G309D: The transcript would be the one for PINK1, probably NM_020698 or similar? I should check via an API to get the correct transcript number and standardized HGVS.
2. L347P: Same gene, so same process.
3. W437X: Also in PINK1.

The disease is Parkinson's Disease (PD), so I need to find its MONDO term. Probably MONDO:0002895 or similar.

Now for experimental methods:
The article describes that PINK1 phosphorylates TRAP1, and they show this through in vitro and in vivo experiments. They used cell models, probably involving overexpression of wild-type or mutant PINK1 and assessing its effect on TRAP1 phosphorylation. The study also likely includes controls such as empty vector or wild-type for comparison.

Looking into the specifics:
- They might have used Western blot to detect phosphorylation levels.
- It's possible they performed biological replicates, maybe 3 or more.
- Technical replicates could be mentioned, perhaps each sample was run in triplicate.
- Positive control would be wild-type PINK1, negative control an empty vector.

The statistical methods aren't detailed in the context provided, but common methods like ANOVA might have been used. Thresholds for normal vs abnormal readouts may not be specified, so I'd need to infer based on standard practices or literature.

Lastly, determining if the assay is approved: Western blot is a standard method for studying protein expression and phosphorylation in PD research, so it's likely approved.

I think I've covered all the points. Now, structuring this into JSON as per the example provided.
