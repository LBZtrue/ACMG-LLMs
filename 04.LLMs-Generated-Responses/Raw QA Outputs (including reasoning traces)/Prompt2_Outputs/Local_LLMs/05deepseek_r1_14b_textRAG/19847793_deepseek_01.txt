Okay, I need to extract information from the provided scientific article about PINK1 mutations and their effects in Parkinson's disease. The user has given a detailed JSON structure to follow, so I must ensure all fields are accurately filled.

First, looking at the Variants Include section. The article mentions heterozygous mutations in the kinase domain of PINK1. It doesn't specify exact HGVS notations or positions, but it's clear that these variants affect either the N-terminus, C-terminus, or kinase domain. Since the specific details are missing, I'll note that as "N.D." for each.

Next, the Described Disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the correct MONDO term for this. From my knowledge, it's MONDO:0002354.

For the Experiment Method, the study uses stable human dopaminergic neuronal cell lines coexpressing wild-type and mutant PINK1. The readout includes apoptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential changes (DCm). They subjected cells to oxidative stress and measured these outcomes. 

The assay method involves creating cell lines with either one or two copies of the mutant PINK1, simulating heterozygous and homozygous states. There's mention of increased apoptosis in mutants under stress but no specific biological or technical replicates described. They likely included controls like wild-type cells as a positive control and empty vectors as negative.

Statistical methods aren't detailed in the abstract, so I'll mark that as "N.D." The thresholds for normal and abnormal aren't specified either, so I'll note those as not determined but indicate it's based on my knowledge.

Finally, the assay method is cell culture-based, which is standard for studying Parkinson's disease, so Approved assay should be "Yes."

I need to structure all this into the JSON format provided, making sure each section is correctly filled and any missing information is marked with "N.D." where applicable.
