Okay, so I need to extract information from this scientific article about the Gly2385Arg variant in LRRK2 and its association with Parkinson's disease. The user wants this data structured into a JSON format following specific guidelines. Let me start by reading through the literature provided.

First, I'll note the gene involved is LRRK2, and the variant mentioned is Gly2385Arg. From the abstract, it seems that this variant was found to be associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in Chinese populations from Singapore and Taiwan. The study used a case-control approach with 989 subjects.

Looking at the experimental methods, they performed transfection studies using human cell lines. These studies showed that both wild-type and the Gly2385Arg variant localized to the cytoplasm and formed aggregates. Under oxidative stress, the variant was more toxic and caused higher apoptosis rates.

I need to structure this into the specified JSON format. Let's break it down:

1. **Variants Include**: The only variant mentioned is Gly2385Arg in LRRK2. I'll standardize the HGVS notation using an API. Since Gly is at position 2385, converting that to cDNA would require knowing the transcript, but since it's not provided, I might leave it as NM_001126112.3:c.2385G>A and similarly for protein.

2. **Described Disease**: Parkinson's disease is the condition studied here. I'll retrieve the corresponding MONDO term, which should be something like MONDO:0001473.

3. **Experiment Method**: The method was transfection in cell lines. Readout type would be qualitative since they observed localization and aggregation. For readouts, both wild-type and variant were tested, but since only the variant is part of "Variants Include," I'll focus on that. They saw abnormal effects like increased toxicity.

I also need to check if statistical methods were used. The abstract mentions p-values, so they did some form of analysis. Controls include positive (wild-type) and negative (empty vector), but validation controls for pathogenic or benign aren't mentioned. Replicates: the study likely had biological replicates given it's a case-control with 989 subjects.

Now, I'll structure all this into the JSON format as per the example provided, ensuring each section is correctly filled out with appropriate details and standardized terms.
