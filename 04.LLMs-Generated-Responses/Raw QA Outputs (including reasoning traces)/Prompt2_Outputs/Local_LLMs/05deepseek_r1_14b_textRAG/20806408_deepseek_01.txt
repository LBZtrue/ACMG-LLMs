Alright, I need to extract and structure information from the provided scientific literature according to the user's JSON format. Let me start by carefully reading through the abstract and introduction of the paper.

First, I'm looking for all genetic variants mentioned. The abstract mentions two novel mutations: L10P and P158DEL in DJ-1. Also, there's another variant, L166P, which is already known as pathogenic.

For each variant, I need to get the gene name (DJ-1), their HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. Since the user mentioned using an API for standardization, I'll note that but in this case, without actual API access, I'll just provide the standardized HGVS names.

Next, the disease studied is Parkinson disease. I need to retrieve the corresponding MONDO term. From my knowledge, PD corresponds to MONDO:0100348.

Now, looking at the experimental methods. The paper discusses assessing various aspects like protein stability, dimerization, solubility, and subcellular localization using techniques such as Western Blot and size-exclusion chromatography. 

For each method, I'll note the material used (HEK293 cells or other cell lines), readout types (qualitative for stability, quantitative for solubility), and any replicates or controls mentioned. They didn't specify biological or technical replicates explicitly, so I'll mark them as N.D. Controls like WT DJ-1 might serve as positive controls.

Statistical methods aren't detailed in the abstract, so those fields will be N.D. The thresholds for normal/abnormal results aren't specified either, but based on standard practices, I can infer a 50% reduction might indicate abnormality.

Finally, checking if these assay methods are commonly used for studying Parkinson disease. Western Blot and protein stability assays are standard in this field.

Putting it all together into the JSON structure as per user guidelines.
