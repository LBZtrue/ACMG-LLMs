Okay, so I need to extract information from the provided scientific article and structure it into a JSON format as per the user's guidelines. Let me start by reading through the literature carefully to identify all relevant details.

First, the study is about LRRK2 phosphorylating Akt1, with implications for Parkinson’s disease. The authors used in vitro kinase assays and knockdown experiments. They identified three mutations: R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T. These mutations affect LRRK2's interaction with Akt1.

I'll begin by extracting the variants. The gene involved is LRRK2, and the variants are R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T. These correspond to specific positions in the protein. For each variant, I need to find their HGVS nomenclature, which likely starts with NM_... as the transcript. The cDNA changes would be based on the amino acid changes at those positions.

Next, I'll standardize the HGVS nomenclature using relevant APIs. Since I can't access external databases right now, I'll note that this step is necessary but not performed here. The protein changes for each variant are clear: R1441C (Arg to Cys), G2019S (Gly to Ser), and I2020T (Ile to Thr).

For the described disease, it's Parkinson’s disease, also known as PARK8. I need to retrieve the MONDO term for this, which should be something like MONDO:0001563.

Moving on to experimental methods, the study uses in vitro kinase assays and pull-down experiments (for interaction). The material source is not explicitly mentioned beyond recombinant proteins, but since it's an in vitro assay, I can assume cell-free extract or purified components. Readout types are quantitative for phosphorylation levels and qualitative for interaction (binding).

The readout descriptions should include each variant's effect. From the literature, all disease-associated mutations reduce interaction and phosphorylation of Akt1. So each variant leads to abnormal results with a partial loss-of-function effect.

Replicates: The article doesn't mention biological or technical replicates, so I'll mark them as N.D. Controls are also not detailed, but since it's an in vitro assay, they might have used wild-type LRRK2 as positive controls and empty vectors as negative, but this isn't specified, so I'll note those as N.D.

Statistical methods aren't mentioned, so that's N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal aren't provided either, so I'll set them based on custom knowledge, like percentage reductions or specific activity levels.

Finally, the assay is approved since in vitro kinase assays are standard for studying enzyme activity and interactions.
