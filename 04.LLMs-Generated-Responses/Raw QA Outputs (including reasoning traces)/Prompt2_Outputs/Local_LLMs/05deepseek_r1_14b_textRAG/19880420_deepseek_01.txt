Okay, I need to extract information from the provided scientific literature and structure it into a JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me start by carefully reading through the context given.

The article discusses PINK1 phosphorylating parkin and its role in activating E3 ligase function and NF-kB signaling. The study was conducted at Emory University, published in 2009. They found that mutations in PINK1 impair its ability to promote parkin's activity, leading to PD.

First, I need to identify all the variants mentioned. Looking through the literature, the paper mentions mutations in PINK1 and parkin causing early-onset PD. However, specific HGVS nomenclature isn't provided for these mutations. So under "Variants Include," both PINK1 and parkin genes will be listed without specific variants since they're not detailed.

Next, the described disease is Parkinson's Disease (PD). I'll retrieve its MONDO term, which is MONDO:0001589.

Now, looking for experimental methods. The paper doesn't explicitly mention any experiments or assays used, such as Western Blot or qPCR. It focuses more on functional studies but without specific assay details. Therefore, all fields related to experiment methods will be marked as N.D., except where noted.

I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring that each field is filled accurately and using "N.D." where information isn't available.
