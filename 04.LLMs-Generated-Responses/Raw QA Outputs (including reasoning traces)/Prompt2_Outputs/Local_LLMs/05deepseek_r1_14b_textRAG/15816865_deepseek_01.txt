Okay, I need to analyze the given scientific article about parkin mutations and extract relevant information into a JSON format as specified. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the task is to extract variant information. The literature mentions that 22 parkin point mutants were analyzed. Each mutant is a missense/nonsense mutation linked to familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, specific HGVS nomenclature isn't provided in the abstract or the given context. Since this is crucial, I might need to note that the HGVS details aren’t mentioned here.

Next, for each variant, I should provide gene name, cDNA and protein changes. The gene is clearly parkin. But without specific variants listed, it's challenging. However, from the abstract, it says "several familial PD-linked point mutations," so perhaps these are known in literature but not detailed here. Since exact details aren't provided, I might have to list them as N.D.

Moving on to the disease description: The study is about Parkinson’s disease. Looking up MONDO terms, I believe the correct term is MONDO:0001468 for Parkinson's disease.

Now, regarding experimental methods. The abstract mentions they conducted a systematic analysis but doesn’t specify the exact assays used—like cell lines, readouts (such as solubility tests, aggregation studies), or controls. Since this information isn't provided in the given context, all these fields would be N.D., except perhaps for the assay method being 'systematic analysis', though that's more of an approach than a specific method.

Other details like biological and technical replicates, controls (positive/negative), statistical methods, thresholds, etc., are not mentioned. Therefore, they should all be marked as N.D.

Finally, determining if the experimental methods are generally used for studying PD: since systematic analysis is a standard approach, I might infer that it's approved.

Putting it all together, the JSON will reflect these findings, with many fields being N.D. due to lack of specific details in the provided literature snippet.
