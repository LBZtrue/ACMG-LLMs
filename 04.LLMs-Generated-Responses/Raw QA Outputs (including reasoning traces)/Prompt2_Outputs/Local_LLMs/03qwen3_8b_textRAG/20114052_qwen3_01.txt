Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided abstract and introduction about α-synuclein and Parkinson's disease, then structure it into a specific JSON format. 

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract mentions the E46K mutation in α-syn. The gene here is SNCA (alpha-synuclein). The HGVS nomenclature for this variant would be NM_001126112.3:c.46G>A, leading to p.E46K. I'll check if the transcript is correctly identified. Since the protein change is E46K, the cDNA position is 46, and the reference nucleotide is G, replaced by A.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease (PD). I need to find the MONDO term for PD. MONDO:0005303 is the correct term for Parkinson's disease. 

For the experimental methods, the study mentions several techniques. The first is the interaction between α-syn fragments and gangliosides. They used synthetic GBD peptides and tested their binding with GM3. This involves biochemical assays, maybe ELISA or binding assays. The second method is the channel formation in phosphatidylcholine bilayers, which is electrophysiological. They compared wild-type and E46K, and tested the effect of GM3. 

I need to structure each method with materials, readouts, controls, replicates, etc. For the GBD binding assay, materials would be synthetic peptides and gangliosides. The readout is quantitative, showing the affinity of E46K vs. wild-type. Controls include wild-type and mutant peptides, and the presence of 3'sialyllactose. 

For the channel formation, the method is electrophysiology. The readout includes channel conductance, selectivity, and voltage response. Controls would be the presence of GM3 in bilayers. 

I need to check if the methods are approved for PD research. Electrophysiology and binding assays are commonly used in studying PD mechanisms, so "Approved assay" should be Yes. 

I'll ensure all fields are filled, using "N.D." where info isn't provided. For example, statistical analysis methods aren't explicitly mentioned, so they might be N.D. or inferred as standard methods. 

Finally, structure all this into the JSON as specified, ensuring variants are standardized, diseases are correctly mapped, and each experiment method is detailed with all required subfields.
