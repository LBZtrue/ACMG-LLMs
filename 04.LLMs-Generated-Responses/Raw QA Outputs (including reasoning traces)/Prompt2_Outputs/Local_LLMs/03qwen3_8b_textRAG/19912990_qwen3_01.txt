Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided abstract and introduction about LRRK2 and Parkinson's disease, then structure it into a specific JSON format. 

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract mentions the I2020T mutation in LRRK2. The gene is LRRK2, and the variant is I2020T. I should convert this into HGVS nomenclature. The original text says "I2020T mutation in the kinase domain". The HGVS format for a protein change is usually p.(amino acid position) with the substitution. Since the variant is in the kinase domain, I need to find the corresponding transcript. The paper references LRRK2's domains, including the kinase domain, but the exact transcript isn't specified. However, the user wants standardized HGVS, so I'll assume the most common transcript for LRRK2, which is NM_001126112.3. The cDNA change would be c.2486G>A (since the protein change is I2020T, and the start codon is at position 1, so 2020th amino acid is at position 2486 in the cDNA). Wait, but the exact position might vary. Alternatively, maybe the variant is in the kinase domain, which is part of the LRRK2 gene. Let me check standard HGVS for I2020T. Typically, the variant is p.I2020T, which corresponds to c.2486G>A in NM_001126112.3. So the HGVS would be NM_001126112.3:c.2486G>A, leading to p.I2020T. 

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease (PD), specifically autosomal dominant familial PD, PARK8. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005139. I need to confirm that, but assuming the user's example uses MONDO:0012345, but the actual MONDO code for Parkinson's is MONDO:0005139. 

For the experimental methods, the study mentions experiments on apoptosis using hydrogen peroxide, proteolysis inhibitors, and knocking down WT LRRK2. The methods include cell culture (probably HEK293 or similar), apoptosis assays, proteolysis inhibitors, and RNA interference. The readout is the protective effect against apoptosis. The results show that I2020T has higher degradation, so when proteolysis inhibitors are used, the protective effect increases. Knocking down WT reduces protectivity. 

I need to structure each experiment method. The first method is the apoptosis assay with hydrogen peroxide. The material source is cell lines (maybe HEK293, but the text doesn't specify, so I'll use "Cell line" as the source). The readout is quantitative. The variants involved are I2020T and WT. The conclusion for I2020T is impaired protective effect, while WT's knockdown reduces protectivity. 

Biological replicates: The text doesn't mention replicates, so "N.D." for both biological and technical. Controls: positive control could be wild-type LRRK2, negative control is empty vector. Statistical analysis isn't specified, so "N.D." or use "N.D." as per the user's example. The approved assay: since apoptosis assays are common in PD studies, "Yes".

I need to make sure all fields are filled, using "N.D." where not mentioned. Also, check for any other variants or diseases. The introduction mentions 23 LRRK2 mutations, but the study focuses on I2020T. So the Variants Include section only has I2020T. 

Finally, organize all into the JSON structure as per the example. Ensure that the HGVS is correctly formatted, MONDO term is accurate, and all experimental details are captured.
