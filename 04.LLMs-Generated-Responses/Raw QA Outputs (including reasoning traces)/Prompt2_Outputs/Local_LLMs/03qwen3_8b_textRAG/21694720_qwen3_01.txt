Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided abstract and introduction about Parkin and Parkinson's disease, and structure it into the specified JSON format. 

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract talks about pathogenic Parkin mutations disrupting autoinhibition. However, specific HGVS nomenclature isn't provided in the text. The user mentioned using APIs to standardize HGVS, but since the literature doesn't list specific variants, I'll have to note that as N.D. in the JSON.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease, specifically Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism linked to parkin gene mutations. I need to find the MONDO term for this. I recall that MONDO:0005469 is for Parkinson's disease, but the exact term for the autosomal recessive form might be different. However, since the literature doesn't specify the exact MONDO code, I might need to use the general term. Wait, the user says to retrieve from MONDO, but if the exact term isn't provided, I should use the most relevant one. Maybe MONDO:0005469 is Parkinson's disease, and the specific form is a subclass. Since the text doesn't specify, I'll use the general term and note it as N.D. if unsure.

For experimental methods, the abstract mentions that pathogenic mutations disrupt autoinhibition, and the mechanism involves ubiquitin binding. The methods described are likely biochemical assays like ubiquitination assays or Western blot. The literature doesn't detail specific experimental methods beyond the molecular findings, so I might have to infer that the methods used were biochemical analyses of Parkin activity. However, the user wants all experimental methods mentioned. Since the abstract doesn't list specific methods like Western Blot or ubiquitination assays, but talks about results, I might need to note that the methods are not explicitly detailed, leading to N.D. for some fields.

The user's example includes detailed methods like Western Blot, but here, the literature doesn't mention specific assays. Therefore, I should note that the experimental methods aren't detailed in the provided text, leading to N.D. for many fields. However, the user's example might have different content, so I need to be careful.

In the JSON structure, under "Variants Include," since no specific variants are mentioned, I'll list the gene as PARK2 (since parkin is also known as PARK2) and note variants as N.D. For the disease, use Parkinson's disease and the MONDO term. For experimental methods, if the literature doesn't specify, all fields under Experiment Method will be N.D. except for the assay method, which might be inferred as biochemical assays, but since it's not explicitly stated, it's safer to mark as N.D.

Wait, the abstract mentions that pathogenic mutations disrupt autoinhibition, which could be studied via assays measuring ubiquitination activity. But without explicit mention of the methods used, I can't assume. The user's instructions say to list all experimental methods mentioned, so if they aren't mentioned, those fields are N.D. 

So, putting it all together: Variants are not specified, so "Variants Include" will have gene PARK2 with variants as N.D. The disease is Parkinson's disease, MONDO:0005469. Experimental methods are not detailed, so all fields under Experiment Method are N.D. except maybe the assay method, but even that is not mentioned. Therefore, the JSON will have N.D. where information isn't provided.
