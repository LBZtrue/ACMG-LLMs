Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided abstract about α-synuclein mutations and structure it into a specific JSON format. First, I need to parse the abstract carefully.

The main variants mentioned are E46K and A53T in the α-synuclein gene. The abstract talks about their effects on polymerization into amyloid fibrils. The disease context is related to pathological inclusions leading to disease, but the exact disease name isn't specified. However, the user wants the MONDO term, which I might need to look up, but since the example doesn't have a specific disease, maybe it's a general term or related to Parkinson's. Wait, the example uses "Hereditary Myopathy" with a MONDO ID. In the given context, the disease is not named, so I should check if the abstract mentions a specific disease. The abstract says "aberrant α-synuclein polymerization resulting in the formation of pathological inclusions can lead to disease." It doesn't name a specific disease, so maybe the disease is unspecified. But the user wants the MONDO term. If it's not specified, I should use "N.D." or a general term. Wait, the example uses a specific disease, but in this case, the abstract doesn't mention a specific one. So perhaps the disease is "Parkinson's disease" or another, but the text doesn't say. Wait, the abstract mentions "the age of onset of disease," so maybe it's referring to Parkinson's. However, without explicit mention, I can't assume. The user's example uses a specific disease, but in the given text, the disease is not named. Therefore, the "Described Disease" should be "Neurodegenerative disease" or similar, but the MONDO term would be needed. Since the text doesn't specify, perhaps the disease is not mentioned, so I should use "N.D." for both the disease name and MONDO. Wait, the user might expect that the disease is related to α-synucleinopathies, like Parkinson's. However, the abstract doesn't state that explicitly. So to be safe, I'll note that the disease is not specified in the text. 

Next, the variants: E46K and A53T. The gene is α-synuclein, which is SNCA. The HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. The abstract mentions "E46K" and "A53T" as mutations. For HGVS, the transcript would be NM_001126112.3 (as per the example's gene description). The cDNA changes would be c.46G>A for E46K (since E is G, K is A?), wait, wait. Wait, the amino acid positions are 46 and 53. The cDNA position would be based on the transcript. Let me check. The protein is 140 amino acids. The repeats are in the N-terminal region. The E46K mutation is in the first repeat, and A53T is in the second. Assuming the transcript is NM_001126112.3, which is the human SNCA gene. The cDNA positions would be calculated based on the protein sequence. For example, E46 would be c.137 (since the start is 1, and each codon is 3 nucleotides). Wait, but the exact positions might need to be determined. However, the user's example uses a different gene, so perhaps the user expects that the HGVS is standardized via an API, but since I can't access external APIs, I'll have to use the information given. The abstract says "E46K" and "A53T" as the mutations. So the HGVS would be NM_001126112.3:c.46G>A (for E46K) and NM_001126112.3:c.53G>A (assuming E is G and K is A? Wait, E is G, K is A? Wait, no. Wait, the amino acid E is encoded by GAA or GAG. Let me think. The actual codon for E (glutamic acid) is GAA or GAG. The codon for K (lysine) is AAA or AAG. So if the mutation is E46K, then the codon at position 46 changes from GAA (E) to AAA (K), which would be a single nucleotide change. But the exact position depends on the transcript. However, the user's example uses a different gene, so perhaps the HGVS is determined by the example's structure. Alternatively, the user might expect that the HGVS is provided as per the example, but since the example is hypothetical, I need to use the information from the abstract. The abstract mentions "E46K" and "A53T" as the mutations. So, the HGVS would be for the SNCA gene, using the transcript NM_001126112.3. For E46K, the cDNA position would be 46, but since each codon is 3 nucleotides, the actual position is calculated as follows: the first codon is 1-3, second 4-6, etc. So position 46 would be the 15th codon (since 46/3 is 15.333). Wait, but the exact position might be different. Alternatively, the mutation is at the 46th amino acid, so the cDNA position is 46*3=138? Or 46th amino acid corresponds to codon 46, which is position 46 in the protein. The cDNA position would be 46 * 3 = 138? But that's not correct. The first codon is positions 1-3, so the 46th amino acid is at codon 46, which is positions 138-140. Wait, but the exact position depends on the transcript. Since the user's example uses a different gene, perhaps the HGVS is given as NM_001126112.3:c.46G>A for E46K and NM_001126112.3:c.53G>A for A53T. But without knowing the exact codons, this is an assumption. However, the user's example might not require precise HGVS, so maybe the HGVS is provided as per the example's structure. 

The experimental methods mentioned in the abstract are in vitro studies on polymerization, possibly using cell lines or assays to measure amyloid formation. The abstract states that the methods involve measuring the effect of these mutations on polymerization. The readout type would be quantitative, comparing the polymerization rates. The controls would include wild-type and other variants. The statistical analysis might be ANOVA or similar. The thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts would be based on the literature, but since they aren't specified, the user's example uses "Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7" for normal. However, in this case, the thresholds are not mentioned, so I'll need to use "Custom" and set them based on knowledge. 

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should include the variants with their HGVS, cDNA, protein changes, the disease as not specified (so "N.D." for both Described Disease and MONDO), and the experimental methods with the details. The Approved assay would be "No" if the method is not standard, but the example uses "Yes" if it is. However, without specific info, it's safer to say "N.D." or "No". 

Wait, the user's example has a specific disease and MONDO term. Since the given text doesn't mention a specific disease, perhaps the disease is related to α-synucleinopathies, like Parkinson's. However, the text doesn't state that explicitly. So, to be accurate, the disease is not specified, so the "Described Disease" and MONDO would be "N.D." or "Neurodegenerative disease" with a MONDO ID. But since the user's example uses a specific term, maybe the answer should reflect that the disease is not named, so the fields are left as N.D. 

In summary, the JSON will have the variants E46K and A53T, the disease as unspecified, and the experimental methods related to polymerization assays.
