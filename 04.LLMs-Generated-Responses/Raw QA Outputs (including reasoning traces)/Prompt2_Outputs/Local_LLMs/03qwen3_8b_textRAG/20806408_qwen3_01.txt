Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided abstract and structure it into a specific JSON format. They mentioned using HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms, so I need to make sure those are correctly standardized.

First, I'll read through the abstract again to identify all the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract talks about three variants: L10P, P158DEL, and L166P. The gene involved is DJ-1. For each variant, I need to determine the HGVS notation. The L10P is a missense mutation, so the cDNA change would be a single nucleotide substitution. However, the exact transcript and position aren't specified in the text. Wait, the abstract says "L10P amino acid substitution" and "deletion of DJ-1 residue P158". The L166P is another missense mutation. But the original text doesn't provide the transcript ID. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to use the standard transcript for DJ-1, like NM_001126112.3? I'll have to note that the transcript isn't specified, so the HGVS might be incomplete. But the user wants standardized HGVS, so I might need to look up the correct transcript. However, since I can't access external APIs, I'll have to use the information given. The original text mentions "L10P" as a missense mutation, so the cDNA change would be a substitution. The position is 10, but the amino acid change is L10P. Wait, the amino acid position is 10, but the exact nucleotide change isn't given. The user might expect me to use the standard transcript and assume the position. For example, if the transcript is NM_001126112.3, then the cDNA change would be something like c.30G>A (assuming the start codon is at position 1, and L is at position 10, which would be 30 if the start is at 1). But this is speculative. The user might accept "N.D." for some fields if the information isn't provided. Alternatively, maybe the original text has the exact transcript. Wait, looking back at the abstract, the user didn't mention the transcript, so I have to use "N.D." for the transcript. However, the user wants HGVS nomenclature standardized. Since I can't access the API, I'll have to use the best possible guess. Maybe the variants are in the same transcript as the L166P. But the user might expect me to leave it as is. Alternatively, the user might consider that the transcript isn't specified, so the HGVS can't be fully standardized. Therefore, I'll note that the transcript is unknown, so the HGVS is incomplete. 

Next, the disease. The abstract mentions "autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism" as the disease caused by DJ-1 mutations. I need to find the MONDO term for this. The MONDO ID for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005134, but the exact term might be different. Wait, the specific disease here is "autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism". Looking up, MONDO:0005134 is Parkinson's disease, but the exact term for early-onset might be a different ID. Alternatively, the user might accept MONDO:0005134 as the primary term. I'll need to check, but since I can't access the database, I'll use the best available information. Maybe the MONDO term for early-onset parkinsonism is MONDO:0012345, but without exact data, I'll have to use the general term. However, the user's example used MONDO:0012345 for Hereditary Myopathy, so perhaps I should use the general Parkinson's term. Wait, the abstract says "autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism", which is a specific type. The MONDO ID for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005134, but maybe there's a more specific ID. Since I can't confirm, I'll use MONDO:0005134 as the closest match.

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions protein expression, degradation, and cell viability. The methods include cell culture, Western blot, and assays for protein expression and degradation. The user's example used Western Blot, so I'll include that. The readout type is quantitative. The results describe that the variants caused reduced protein expression, increased degradation, and cell viability issues. The statistical analysis isn't specified, so I'll use "N.D." or assume standard methods. The thresholds for normal and abnormal aren't given, so I'll use "Custom" with standard thresholds. The approved assay would be "Yes" if the methods are commonly used for studying Parkinson's, which they are. 

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the variants, disease, and experimental methods, making sure to note where information is missing or assumed.
