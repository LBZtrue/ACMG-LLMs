Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided abstract about α-synuclein (αS) and its mutations related to Parkinson disease (PD). They need the data structured in a specific JSON format with standardized HGVS nomenclature and MONDO disease terms.

First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. The key points are the three PD-linked mutations in αS, their effects on detergent and membrane-bound conformations, and the experimental methods used, which include pulsed dipolar ESR measurements.

For the variants, the abstract mentions three point mutations leading to early-onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism. However, the exact HGVS nomenclature isn't provided in the text. The user's example includes specific HGVS entries like NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A, but the actual paper here doesn't list the specific mutations. Wait, the user's example might not be directly applicable here. The original abstract says "three PD-linked mutations" but doesn't specify which ones. Since the user wants HGVS standardized via API, but the text doesn't provide the exact variants, I might have to note that as N.D.

Next, the disease is Parkinson disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson disease. MONDO:0005118 is the correct term for Parkinson disease. So, the "Described Disease" would be "Parkinson Disease" with MONDO:0005118.

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions pulsed dipolar ESR measurements of distances up to 8.7 nm. The method is ESR (Electron Spin Resonance), specifically pulsed dipolar ESR. The materials used would be αS protein, possibly in detergent micelles. The readout type is quantitative, as they measure distances and conformational changes. The readout description should include all variants, but since the variants aren't specified, maybe the conclusion is that the mutants retain the ability to transition between conformations. The user's example includes variants in the readout description, but here, without specific variants, I might have to use N.D. or note that the variants are not detailed.

The user's JSON structure requires "Readout description" to include all variants from "Variants Include", but if the variants aren't provided, that field would be empty or N.D. However, the user's example includes the variant in the readout description. Since the original text doesn't specify the exact mutations, the "Variants Include" section might be empty or marked as N.D.

Wait, the user's instruction says to extract all relevant variant information from the literature. The abstract mentions three PD-linked mutations but doesn't specify their HGVS nomenclature. Therefore, the "Variants Include" section would have the gene as SNCA (α-synuclein), and the variants would be listed with HGVS as N.D. because the exact mutations aren't provided. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the three mutations to be listed as variants without specific HGVS, but the instructions require HGVS nomenclature. Since the text doesn't provide them, I should use "N.D." for HGVS.

The experimental method is pulsed dipolar ESR. The material source would be the αS protein, possibly in detergent micelles. The readout type is quantitative. The result description mentions that all three mutants retain the ability to transition between broken and extended helix conformations. Since there are no specific variants listed, the readout description might have variants as N.D. or not included. The approved assay would be "Yes" if this method is commonly used for PD studies, but I need to check if ESR is standard for PD. Alternatively, since the method is specific to conformational analysis, it might not be a general assay for PD but rather for structural studies. However, the user's example includes an approved assay as "Yes" if it's used for the disease. I'll have to determine that based on standard practices.

Putting it all together, the JSON would have the gene as SNCA, variants as N.D., disease as Parkinson Disease with MONDO term, and the experimental method as pulsed dipolar ESR with the readout description noting the conformational transitions without specific variants. The approved assay might be "No" if it's not a standard method for PD, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the method is considered approved, it's "Yes". I'll need to make an educated guess here.
