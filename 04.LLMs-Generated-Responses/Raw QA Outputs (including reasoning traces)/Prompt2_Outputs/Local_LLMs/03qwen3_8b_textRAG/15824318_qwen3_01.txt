Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want me to extract information from a given scientific abstract and structure it into a specific JSON format. The user provided a detailed example, so I need to follow that closely.

First, I need to parse the abstract for genetic variants. The abstract mentions two mutations in the PINK1 gene: G309D and L347P. The gene is PINK1, which is associated with recessive parkinsonism. The variants are point mutations. 

For each variant, I need to determine the HGVS nomenclature. The abstract doesn't specify the transcript, so I might need to infer or use standard conventions. Typically, for PINK1, the most common transcript is NM_001126112.3. So, G309D would be NM_001126112.3:c.799G>A (since G309 is the amino acid position, which corresponds to cDNA position 799 for the transcript NM_001126112.3). Wait, but the user's example uses c.248G>A for position 83. So maybe the cDNA position is calculated as (amino acid position -1) * 3. For G309, that would be 309*3=927, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the cDNA position is 309-1=308? Wait, the example given in the user's example had c.248G>A for position 83, which is 83*3=249, but the example shows 248. Hmm, perhaps the user's example is using a different method. Since the user's example might not be accurate, I need to rely on standard HGVS nomenclature. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's example is illustrative, and I need to use standard HGVS for PINK1. Let me check. For PINK1, the transcript NM_001126112.3 is the main one. The amino acid positions are based on this transcript. For example, the G309D mutation would be at position 309 in the protein, which corresponds to the cDNA position 309*3=927? Wait, no. Each codon is 3 nucleotides. So if the amino acid is at position 309, the cDNA position would be 309*3=927. But the user's example for p.G83D is c.248G>A. That suggests that the cDNA position is 248, which is 83*3. So 83*3=249, but the example shows 248. Maybe the user's example is a typo, but regardless, I should follow the standard method. 

So for G309D, assuming the transcript is NM_001126112.3, the cDNA position would be 309*3=927. Therefore, HGVS would be NM_001126112.3:c.927G>A. But wait, the original text says "G309D" which is the amino acid change. So the cDNA position would be 309*3=927. So the HGVS would be NM_001126112.3:c.927G>A. Similarly, L347P would be NM_001126112.3:c.1040C>T (since 347*3=1041, but maybe the user's example is different. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is using a different transcript. Wait, the user's example had p.G83D as c.248G>A, which is 248/3=82.66, which is not exact. This suggests that maybe the user's example is using a different method. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is illustrative, and I need to rely on standard HGVS. For the purpose of this task, I'll assume that the transcript is NM_001126112.3 and that the cDNA position is calculated as (amino acid position -1)*3 +1. For example, for position 1, cDNA position is 1. For position 2, cDNA position 4, etc. Wait, that might not be correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is using a different approach, but since the user hasn't provided specific details, I'll proceed with standard HGVS for PINK1. 

Next, the disease mentioned is recessive parkinsonism. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005385, but the abstract says "recessive parkinsonism" which might be a specific term. However, the user's example used a different disease, so I need to check if there's a specific MONDO code for this. But since the user hasn't provided that, I'll have to use the general term. However, the example in the user's prompt uses "Hereditary Myopathy" with MONDO:0012345. So maybe I should use the general term for Parkinson's. 

Now, the experimental methods. The abstract mentions in vitro assays for kinase activity and in vivo studies. The methods include in vitro kinase assays and in vivo studies using mouse models. 

For each method, I need to extract the material source, readout type, etc. 

The "Approved assay" field requires determining if these methods are generally used for studying the disease. Since the abstract mentions both in vitro and in vivo methods, which are standard in such studies, it's likely "Yes". 

Putting it all together, I need to structure the JSON with the variants, the disease, and the experimental methods. 

I'll proceed step by step, ensuring each part of the JSON is filled according to the user's example and the provided abstract.
