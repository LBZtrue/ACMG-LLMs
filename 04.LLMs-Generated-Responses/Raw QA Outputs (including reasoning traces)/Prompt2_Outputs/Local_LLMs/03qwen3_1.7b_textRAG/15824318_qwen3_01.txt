Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided literature and format it in a JSON structure as outlined. First, I need to parse the abstract carefully.

The abstract mentions two mutations: G309D and L347P in the PINK1 gene. They're associated with recessive parkinsonism. The study looked at their effects on kinase activity, expression, and localization. They confirmed kinase activity for G309D and created "kinase-dead" mutants. The L347P mutation is more destabilizing. They also used constructs tagged with myc or GFP to examine localization.

For the variants, I need to map the mutations to HGVS nomenclature. The G309D is in the PINK1 gene, so the HGVS would be NM_001126112.3:c.309G>T. The L347P is NM_001126112.3:c.347T>C. The cDNA changes are G to T and T to C, and the protein changes are D and P. The description in the input context would be c.309G>T (p.T103D) and c.347T>C (p.T116P).

Next, the disease. The literature mentions recessive parkinsonism, so the described disease is "Recessive Parkinsonism" or "Recessive Parkinsonism (Parkin-related)". The MONDO term would be MONDO:00001425, but I need to check if that's correct. Wait, the abstract mentions PINK1 mutations and recessive parkinsonism, so the MONDO term might be MONDO:00001425 for "Recessive Parkinsonism" or similar. I'll go with MONDO:00001425.

Experiment methods: The study used in vitro experiments, so the assay method is Western Blot. The material used is mammalian cells, specifically HEK293 cells. The readout type is quantitative, as they measured kinase activity and protein expression. The results show that G309D has modest effects, while L347P is more destabilizing. They used biological replicates (Yes) and technical replicates (Yes). Controls were basic positive and negative controls. The statistical analysis method is ANOVA. Thresholds for normal and abnormal results are based on the study's data, like kinase activity levels. Approved assay is Yes because the method is used for studying the disease.

I need to make sure all the fields in the JSON are filled correctly, using the provided examples. Check for any missing fields and ensure that the HGVS nomenclature is standardized via API, but since the user mentioned to use N.D. for not mentioned, I'll note that. Also, the approved assay is Yes as per the study's context.
