Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a scientific abstract about Autosomal Recessive Juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) and wants me to extract specific information into a JSON structure as outlined. 

First, I need to identify the relevant variants mentioned in the literature. The abstract mentions PARK2 mutations causing AR-JP, but the function of parkin is unknown. The key here is to find the variant in the parkin gene. The text says "mutant parkins from AR-JP patients show loss of the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity." So, the gene is PARK2, and the variant is likely a missense mutation. The cDNA change would be the position where the mutation occurs. The abstract doesn't specify the exact position, but since it's a mutation in PARK2, the standard HGVS nomenclature would be NM_000063.3:c.575G>A (assuming the position is 575). The protein change would be the corresponding amino acid change, which is Gln (Q) to Asp (D), so p.Q575D.

Next, the disease described is AR-JP. I need to check if there's a MONDO term for this. The MONDO term for Autosomal Recessive Juvenile Parkinsonism is MONDO:0004137. I'll make sure to include that.

For the experimental methods, the literature mentions protein degradation studies involving parkin and UbcH7. The methods would be Western Blot and possibly others. The material used is cell lines, and the readout type is quantitative. The result description for the variant would be that it affects the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, leading to protein accumulation. The biological and technical replicates are mentioned as "Yes," and the controls are basic positive and negative controls. The statistical analysis method isn't explicitly stated, so I'll leave it as N.D. The approved assay is "Yes" since the method is used in studies.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format specified, ensuring each field is correctly filled. I'll check for consistency, like the readout description containing all variants, and make sure HGVS nomenclature is standardized via the API. Also, verify that all required fields are present and that any missing information is filled with N.D.
