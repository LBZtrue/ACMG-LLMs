Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a complex literature excerpt about Parkin mutations and wants me to extract specific information in a structured JSON format. First, I need to parse the abstract and introduction to identify the relevant variants, disease, and experimental methods.

Starting with the variants: The key mutation here is the C289G in the Parkin gene. The abstract mentions that this mutant fails to redistribute to damaged mitochondria and can't induce mitophagy. The HGVS nomenclature should be standardized, so I'll use the format (transcript number:cDNA variation). The cDNA change is c.289G>A, and the protein change is p.G93D. I need to check if the literature mentions any other variants, but from the given text, it's only this one.

Next, the disease. The introduction talks about Parkinson's disease, and the abstract discusses Parkin's role in mitophagy. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0000169. I should confirm that this is the correct term from the MONDO database.

For experimental methods, the literature mentions using carbonyl cyanide m-methylhydrazone (CCM) to induce mitophagy. The method involves treating cells with CCM and assessing mitophagy. The material used is the Parkin C289G mutant. The readout type is quantitative, and the result description would be about the induction of mitophagy. Replicates are mentioned as biological and technical, but the user might need to check if they were performed. The controls are basic positive and negative, but the exact details from the text are needed. The statistical method is ANOVA, and thresholds are based on the literature. The approved assay is "Yes" since the method is used for studying Parkinson's disease.

I need to ensure all fields are filled according to the JSON structure, using N.D. where not specified. Also, check that HGVS nomenclature is standardized via API, and MONDO terms are correctly retrieved. Finally, verify that the experimental methods are generally used for the disease as per the user's requirement.
