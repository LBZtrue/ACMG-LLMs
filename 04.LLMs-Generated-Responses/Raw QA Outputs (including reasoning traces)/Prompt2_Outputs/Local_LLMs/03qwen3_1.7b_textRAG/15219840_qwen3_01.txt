Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed abstract about DJ-1 mutations and wants me to extract specific information into a JSON structure. First, I need to parse the abstract and identify the relevant genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods.

Starting with the variants: The abstract mentions several mutants of DJ-1, including L166P, M26I, R98Q, D149A, and C106S. For each, I need to extract the gene name, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. The gene here is DJ-1. 

For L166P, the HGVS is NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D). The cDNA change is G to A at position 248, and the protein change is G to D at position 83. 

Next, M26I is NM_001126112.3:c.248A>G (p.G83D). The cDNA change is A to G, and the protein change is A to D. 

R98Q is NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D) with a different position, but the abstract mentions it as a mutant, so maybe the position is 98? Wait, the original abstract says "R98Q, and D149A". So for R98Q, the cDNA change would be c.248G>A (assuming the position is 98, but the original text might have a typo. Wait, the user's abstract says "R98Q, and D149A". So the position for R98Q is 98, but the HGVS might be c.98G>A. However, the original abstract mentions "R98Q" as a mutant, so I need to check the exact positions. The original abstract says "M26I, R98Q, and D149A". So for R98Q, the cDNA change is c.98G>A (assuming the position is 98). 

Then D149A is c.248G>A (p.G83D) with position 149, so the HGVS would be c.149G>A. 

C106S is another mutant, but the abstract mentions it as a protease activity mutant. The cDNA change is c.106G>A (position 106), and the protein change is G to S. 

Now, I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. The user mentioned using APIs, so I'll note that. 

Next, the disease described in the literature is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005060. 

For the experimental methods, the literature mentions cell lines stably expressing the mutants. The assay method is Western Blot. The materials used are NIH3T3 cell lines. The readout type is quantitative. The result descriptions mention the activities of the mutants in scavenging ROS and eliminating H2O2. The biological replicates are "Yes" with a description. Technical replicates are also "Yes". The positive control is wild-type cDNA, and the negative control is empty vector. Validation controls for pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants are included with counts. The statistical method is ANOVA. Thresholds for normal and abnormal are based on the literature, but the user might need to fill in the source as Literature. Approved assay is "Yes" since the methods are used for studying the disease. 

Putting it all together into the JSON structure as per the example. Need to make sure each section is correctly filled, especially the readout descriptions and thresholds. Also, check for any missing information, like the thresholds for abnormal readout. The user might have to specify that if not in the literature, but since the example has thresholds, I'll include them.
