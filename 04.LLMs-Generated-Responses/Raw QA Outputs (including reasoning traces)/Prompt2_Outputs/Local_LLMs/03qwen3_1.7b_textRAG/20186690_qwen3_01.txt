Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a lengthy abstract and wants me to extract specific information in a structured JSON format. The main points they're asking for are about genetic variants, the disease studied, and experimental methods. 

First, I need to identify the relevant genetic variants mentioned in the abstract. The key variants are rs34778348 (G4A; p.G2385R) and rs33949390 (G4C; p.R1628P) in the LRRK2 gene. There's also a mention of the absence of the common variant rs34637584 (G4A; p.G2019S) in Chinese populations. 

Next, the disease described is Parkinson's disease (PD), and the MONDO term for PD is MONDO:0005151. I need to make sure the MONDO term is correctly retrieved. 

For the experimental methods, the literature mentions sequencing the coding regions in PD patients and comparing variants in 250 patients and 250 controls. They also used a larger sample of 1,363 patients and 1,251 controls. The methods include sequencing, variant analysis, and in vitro experiments with dopaminergic neuronal lines. 

I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for each variant. For example, rs34778348 is G4A; p.G2385R, which translates to NM_000636.3:c.2385G>A (p.G795R). Similarly, rs33949390 is G4C; p.R1628P, which would be NM_000636.3:c.1628G>C (p.R543P). 

The experimental methods section should include details about the sample sizes, the types of experiments (like sequencing and in vitro testing), and the controls used. The biological and technical replicates are mentioned, as well as the statistical methods. 

I need to check if the methods are generally used for studying PD. Since the study involved large-scale sequencing and in vitro experiments, it's likely that these methods are standard for PD research. 

Finally, structuring all this into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled correctly with the extracted information, and adhering to the constraints provided. I'll make sure not to add any extra information and that all parts of the JSON are accurately represented based on the literature.
