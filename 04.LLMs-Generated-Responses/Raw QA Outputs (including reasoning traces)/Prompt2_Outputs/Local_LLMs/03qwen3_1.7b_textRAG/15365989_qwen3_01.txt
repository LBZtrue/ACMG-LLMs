Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed abstract and wants me to extract specific information in a structured JSON format. First, I need to parse the abstract and identify the relevant genetic variants, disease, and experimental methods.

Starting with the variants: The abstract mentions a third mutation in the DJ1 gene, specifically c.192G>T (p.E64D). The gene is DJ1, and the variant is in the context of early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). The user wants the HGVS nomenclature standardized via an API. So, I'll format the HGVS as NM_000065.3:c.192G>T, with the protein change as p.E64D. The description in the input context is given as "c.192G>T (p.E64D)".

Next, the disease. The study is about EOPD, and the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0003063. The user wants the disease name and MONDO term, so I'll include "Early-Onset Parkinson Disease" and the MONDO code.

For experimental methods, the literature mentions PET scans using [18F]FP-CIT to assess dopamine uptake. There's also a Western Blot experiment with HEK293 cells. The material used includes the cell line, and the readout types are quantitative. The biological and technical replicates are mentioned, as well as the positive and negative controls. The statistical analysis method is ANOVA, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results are based on the literature. The approved assay is "Yes" since the methods are generally used for studying the disease.

I need to structure all this into the required JSON format, ensuring each section is filled correctly. I'll check for any missing fields and use "N.D." where not specified. Also, make sure the HGVS is standardized and the MONDO term is correct. Finally, verify that all parts of the JSON are covered without omissions.
