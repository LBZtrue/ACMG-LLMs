Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided abstract and literature, standardize HGVS nomenclature, retrieve disease terms from MONDO, and detail experimental methods. 

First, I need to identify the variants mentioned in the abstract. The key variants are I2020T and G2019S in the LRRK2 gene. The abstract mentions that these mutations affect ATP affinity and kinase activity. 

For the HGVS nomenclature, I should follow the standard format. The gene is LRRK2, and the variants are in the kinase domain. The positions are given as I2020T and G2019S. The cDNA changes would be the positions with the mutations, and the protein changes would be the corresponding amino acids. 

Next, the disease described in the literature is Parkinson's disease (PD), specifically late-onset autosomal dominant PD. The MONDO term for PD is MONDO:0000146. 

Now, the experimental methods. The literature mentions binding assays, enzymatic assays, and in vitro kinase activity assays. For each method, I need to extract material sources, readout types, result descriptions, replicates, controls, statistical methods, and thresholds. 

For the binding assays, the materials are likely LRRK2 proteins or recombinant proteins. The readout type is qualitative or quantitative. The results mention lower or higher ATP affinity. Replicates might be biological and technical. Controls would include positive and negative controls. Statistical methods could be ANOVA, and thresholds for normal results are based on the literature's description. 

The enzymatic assays involve ATP-competitive inhibitors, so the readout is quantitative. The in vitro kinase activity assay uses specific concentrations of ATP. The results show differences in resistance to inhibitors. Replicates and controls are similar to the binding assays. 

I need to make sure all these details are extracted accurately and standardized. Also, check if the experimental methods are generally used for studying PD. The literature mentions these methods, so the approved assay would be Yes. 

Finally, structure the JSON according to the provided schema, ensuring all required fields are filled with the extracted information. Avoid any markdown and keep the JSON valid.
