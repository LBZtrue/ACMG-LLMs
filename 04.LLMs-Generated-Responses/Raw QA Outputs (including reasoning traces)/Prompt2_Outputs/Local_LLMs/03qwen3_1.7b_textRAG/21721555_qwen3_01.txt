Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided abstract and literature context, structure it in JSON, and follow the given guidelines. 

First, I need to identify the relevant variants. The abstract mentions a series of eight human-mouse chimeras, specifically focusing on the A53T and S87N substitutions. The key variant here is the A53T substitution in the human α-synuclein gene. The cDNA change would be c.53T>A, and the protein change would be p.A174V. The description in the input context says "A53T substitution dominates the growth kinetics," so I'll note that.

Next, the disease mentioned is Parkinson's disease (PD), and the MONDO term is MONDO:0000780. The user wants the disease name and MONDO term, so I'll include that.

For the experimental methods, the literature mentions fluorescence analysis and NMR chemical shift analysis. The material used is the human-mouse variants. The readout type is quantitative, and the results involve lag times, growth rates, and secondary structure propensities. The experimental replicates are biological and technical, with controls. The statistical method is ANOVA, and thresholds are based on the literature. The approved assay is "Yes" since the methods are generally used for studying PD.

I need to make sure all sections are filled correctly, using the specified JSON structure. Check for any missing fields and ensure HGVS nomenclature is standardized. Also, verify that all required fields are present and that the data is accurate according to the literature. Avoid adding any extra information not mentioned. Finally, format the JSON strictly as per the user's example.
