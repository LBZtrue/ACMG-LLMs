Based on the provided text, I'll extract and structure the information according to the required JSON format.

First, let me identify the key information:

1. Genetic variants:
   - m.14319T.C in MT-ND5 gene
   - m.12397A.G in MT-ND6 gene

2. Experimental methods:
   - Sanger sequencing of mtDNA
   - Western blot analysis

3. Material used:
   - Fibroblasts from patient's biopsy
   - Blood samples from patient, mother, and father

4. Disease context:
   - Mitochondrial disease (not specifically named)

Let me now structure this information in the required JSON format:

I have created the JSON structure based on the provided text. Here are some key points about the data:

1. The variants identified are mitochondrial DNA mutations:
   - m.14319T>C in MT-ND5 gene (NC_012920.1 reference)
   - m.12397A>G in MT-ND6 gene (NC_012920.1 reference)

2. Two experimental methods were used:
   - Sanger sequencing to identify the mtDNA variants
   - Western blot to analyze OXPHOS complex subunits

3. The disease studied appears to be a mitochondrial disease, for which I've used MONDO:0013752 as the term.

4. Several fields are marked as "N.D." (Not Determined) because the information was not explicitly stated in the provided text.

5. Both experimental methods were marked as "Approved assay" since they are standard methods used for studying mitochondrial diseases.

6. For protein changes, only MT-ND5 had an identifiable amino acid change (Isoleucine to Threonine) while MT-ND6 information was not provided.

This JSON structure follows the format and requirements specified in the instructions.

Based on the provided text, I'll extract and structure the information according to the required JSON format.

First, let me identify the key information:

1. Genetic variants:
   - m.14319T.C in MT-ND5 gene
   - m.12397A.G in MT-ND6 gene

2. Experimental methods:
   - Sanger sequencing of mtDNA
   - Western blot analysis

3. Material used:
   - Fibroblasts from patient's biopsy
   - Blood samples from patient, mother, and father

4. Disease context:
   - Mitochondrial disease (not specifically named)

Let me now structure this information in the required JSON format:

I have created the JSON structure based on the provided text. Here are some key points about the data:

1. The variants identified are mitochondrial DNA mutations:
   - m.14319T>C in MT-ND5 gene (NC_012920.1 reference)
   - m.12397A>G in MT-ND6 gene (NC_012920.1 reference)

2. Two experimental methods were used:
   - Sanger sequencing to identify the mtDNA variants
   - Western blot to analyze OXPHOS complex subunits

3. The disease studied appears to be a mitochondrial disease, for which I've used MONDO:0013752 as the term.

4. Several fields are marked as "N.D." (Not Determined) because the information was not explicitly stated in the provided text.

5. Both experimental methods were marked as "Approved assay" since they are standard methods used for studying mitochondrial diseases.

6. For protein changes, only MT-ND5 had an identifiable amino acid change (Isoleucine to Threonine) while MT-ND6 information was not provided.

This JSON structure follows the format and requirements specified in the instructions.

I apologize for the repetition. I had to ensure I provided the complete JSON structure based on the information in the provided text. The JSON structure represents the information extracted from the text about mitochondrial DNA mutations and their analysis using sequencing and western blot techniques.

The output contains two genetic variants (m.14319T.C in MT-ND5 and m.12397A.G in MT-ND6), one disease term (Mitochondrial Disease with MONDO:0013752), and two experimental methods (Sanger sequencing and Western blot).

All fields in the JSON structure are filled according to the provided text, with "N.D." used for information that was not explicitly stated in the text.
Okay, I've completed the extraction process and created a JSON structure that includes all the relevant information about the genetic variants, the disease being studied, and the experimental methods used.
