I have filled in the JSON structure with the information extracted from the provided literature abstract. Here's how I processed the data:

1. Variant Information Extraction:
   - Gene: LRRK2
   - Identified variants:
     - G2019S: Standardized to NM_198578.4:c.6055G>A
     - I2020T: Standardized to NM_198578.4:c.6059T>C

2. Disease Identification:
   - The disease studied is Parkinson's disease, with the corresponding MONDO term being MONDO:0005180.

3. Experimental Methods Extraction:
   - Identified three experimental methods: TR-FRET binding assay, enzymatic assay, and binding assay.
   - Technical replicates were mentioned as being used in the literature ("All assays were performed using either three or four replicates for each data point represented").
   - Other fields that weren't explicitly mentioned in the provided abstract were marked as "N.D." (Not Described).

4. Readout Descriptions:
   - Included both variants in each experimental method's readout description.
   - For molecular effects, I interpreted the literature's descriptions to determine that G2019S shows a gain-of-function effect while I2020T shows a partial loss-of-function effect.

5. Approved Assay:
   - Based on the context that these methods are commonly used for studying Parkinson's disease, I marked "Approved assay" as "Yes" for each method.

I have filled in the JSON structure with the information extracted from the provided literature abstract. Here's how I processed the data:

1. Variant Information Extraction:
   - Gene: LRRK2
   - Identified variants:
     - G2019S: Standardized to NM_198578.4:c.6055G>A
     - I2020T: Standardized to NM_198578.4:c.6059T>C

2. Disease Identification:
   - The disease studied is Parkinson's disease, with the corresponding MONDO term being MONDO:0005180.

3. Experimental Methods Extraction:
   - Identified three experimental methods: TR-FRET binding assay, enzymatic assay, and binding assay.
   - Technical replicates were mentioned as being used in the literature ("All assays were performed using either three or four replicates for each data point represented").
   - Other fields that weren't explicitly mentioned in the provided abstract were marked as "N.D." (Not Described).

4. Readout Descriptions:
   - Included both variants in each experimental method's readout description.
   - For molecular effects, I interpreted the literature's descriptions to determine that G2019S shows a gain-of-function effect while I2020T shows a partial loss-of-function effect.

5. Approved Assay:
   - Based on the context that these methods are commonly used for studying Parkinson's disease, I marked "Approved assay" as "Yes" for each method.
