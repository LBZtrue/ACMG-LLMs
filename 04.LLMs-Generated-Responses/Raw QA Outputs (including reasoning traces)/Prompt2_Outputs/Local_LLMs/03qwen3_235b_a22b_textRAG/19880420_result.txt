### Notes:
1. **HGVS Standardization**: All variant nomenclatures were standardized using the NM_032409.3 transcript reference for PINK1. This transcript was selected based on common usage in literature and database annotations.
2. **MONDO Term**: The MONDO term for "Early-onset familial Parkinson's disease" was retrieved as MONDO:0014131 from the Monarch Disease Ontology database.
3. **Experimental Method**: Immunoblotting was used to determine cytochrome c release, a standard method in studying mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
4. **Control Settings**: Wild-type PINK1 was used as a positive control, and empty vector as a negative control.
5. **Statistical Analysis**: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis, with a P-value threshold of <0.05 for significance.
6. **Thresholds**: Since the literature did not explicitly define thresholds for normal and abnormal results, these were inferred based on common standards in similar experimental setups.
7. **Approved Assay**: Immunoblotting is a widely accepted method in Parkinson's disease research for assessing mitochondrial protein expression and cytoprotective pathway activity.
