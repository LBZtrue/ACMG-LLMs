I'm a professional scientific literature miner and data standardization expert. Based on the provided context, I've extracted and structured the information into the required JSON format. Here's what I've found:

1. The study involves "healthy Dkc1 m mice" which indicates a mouse model with a Dkc1 gene modification.
2. The primary disease being studied appears to be Dyskeratosis Congenita, which corresponds to MONDO:0008073 in the Monarch Disease Ontology database.
3. The experimental method described is a Colony Formation Assay.
4. The data are expressed as the percentage of colony numbers present in the cultures.
5. The results include mean values with standard error (SE) from triplicates of one of three independent experiments.

Notably, the context doesn't provide specific variant information with HGVS nomenclature, nor does it give details about specific molecular effects or readout thresholds. I've marked these as "N.D." (Not Determined) in accordance with the requirements.
