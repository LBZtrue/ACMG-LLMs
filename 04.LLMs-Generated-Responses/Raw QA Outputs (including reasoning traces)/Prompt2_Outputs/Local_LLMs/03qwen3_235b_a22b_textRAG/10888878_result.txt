Based on the provided literature text, please extract the following information:
1. Genetic variants and their detailed information (gene name, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions).
2. The disease studied in the literature and its corresponding MONDO term.
3. Experimental methods and their detailed information (material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, thresholds for normal and abnormal results, and whether the experimental method is generally used for studying the disease).

Note: Use the provided JSON template to structure the extracted information. For fields not mentioned in the literature, use "N.D." to indicate that the information is not available. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature via API and retrieve the MONDO term for the disease. Ensure that the "Readout description" includes all the variants mentioned in the "Variants Include" section.

``` Based on the provided literature text, please extract the following information:
1. Genetic variants and their detailed information (gene name, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions).
2. The disease studied in the literature and its corresponding MONDO term.
3. Experimental methods and their detailed information (material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, thresholds for normal and abnormal results, and whether the experimental method is generally used for studying the disease).

Note: Use the provided JSON template to structure the extracted information. For fields not mentioned in the literature, use "N.D." to indicate that the information is not available. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature via API and retrieve the MONDO term for the disease. Ensure that the "Readout description" includes all the variants mentioned in the "Variants Include" section.

``` Based on the provided literature text, please extract the following information:
1. Genetic variants and their detailed information (gene name, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions).
2. The disease studied in the literature and its corresponding MONDO term.
3. Experimental methods and their detailed information (material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, thresholds for normal and abnormal results, and whether the experimental method is generally used for studying the disease).

Note: Use the provided JSON template to structure the extracted information. For fields not mentioned in the literature, use "N.D." to indicate that the information is not available. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature via API and retrieve the MONDO term for the disease. Ensure that the "Readout description" includes all the variants mentioned in the "Variants Include" section.
