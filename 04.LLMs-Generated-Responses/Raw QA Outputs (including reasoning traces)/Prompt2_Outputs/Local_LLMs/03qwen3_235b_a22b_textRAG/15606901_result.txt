``` Based on the provided context, the following information was extracted and structured according to the specified JSON format:

1. **Variants Include**:
   - Two variants in the PRKN gene were identified: a deletion and a substitution. Their HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions were filled in according to the context provided.

2. **Described Disease**:
   - The disease studied in the literature is Parkinson's disease. The corresponding MONDO term was retrieved as MONDO:0005180.

3. **Experiment Method**:
   - The experimental method used was Western blot, conducted using HEK293 cells.
   - The readout type was qualitative, and the readout description included the effects of the two variants on ubiquitination activity.
   - Basic positive and negative controls were mentioned, but information on biological and technical replicates, validation controls, statistical analysis, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results were not specified in the context provided. Thus, these fields were filled with "N.D."
   - The experimental method was marked as an approved assay for studying Parkinson's disease.

``` Based on the provided context, the following information was extracted and structured according to the specified JSON format:

1. **Variants Include**:
   - Two variants in the PRKN gene were identified: a deletion (NM_004562.4:c.931_946del) and a substitution (NM_004562.4:c.1057G>A).
   - Their cDNA and protein changes were detailed, along with descriptions from the input context.

2. **Described Disease**:
   - The disease studied was Parkinson's disease, with the corresponding MONDO term MONDO:0005180.

3. **Experiment Method**:
   - The experimental method used was Western blot, conducted using HEK293 cells.
   - The readout type was qualitative, and the readout description included the effects of the variants on ubiquitination activity.
   - Basic positive and negative controls were mentioned, but information on biological and technical replicates, validation controls, statistical analysis, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results were not specified in the context provided. Thus, these fields were filled with "N.D."
   - The experimental method was marked as an approved assay for studying Parkinson's disease.

The extracted information adheres to the user's requirements and follows the predefined JSON structure. Fields not mentioned in the literature were filled with "N.D." as instructed.
