### Summary
The literature describes the LRRK2 I2020T mutation and its role in Parkinson's disease. Two experimental methods were identified: Western Blot and Cell Viability Assay. Both methods were conducted using HEK293 cells. The I2020T mutation showed increased susceptibility to degradation and neurodegeneration, which could be restored by preventing intracellular degradation. The experimental methods are approved for studying Parkinson's disease, but details on replicates, controls, and statistical analysis were not provided in the literature. This JSON structure follows the user's requested format and includes all relevant information extracted from the literature. Any missing details are marked as "N.D." (Not Described). Parkinson's disease was mapped to its corresponding MONDO term (MONDO:0005180). The HGVS nomenclature for the LRRK2 variant was standardized using the NM_198578.5 transcript. All other fields were filled based on the explicit information provided in the literature. If further details are required, additional sections or annotations can be added to the JSON structure.

### Summary
The literature describes the LRRK2 I2020T mutation and its role in Parkinson's disease. Two experimental methods were identified: Western Blot and Cell Viability Assay. Both methods were conducted using HEK293 cells. The I2020T mutation showed increased susceptibility to degradation and neurodegeneration, which could be restored by preventing intracellular degradation. The experimental methods are approved for studying Parkinson's disease, but details on replicates, controls, and statistical analysis were not provided in the literature. This JSON structure follows the user's requested format and includes all relevant information extracted from the literature. Any missing details are marked as "N.D." (Not Described). Parkinson's disease was mapped to its corresponding MONDO term (MONDO:0005180). The HGVS nomenclature for the LRRK2 variant was standardized using the NM_198578.5 transcript. All other fields were filled based on the explicit information provided in the literature. If further details are required, additional sections or annotations can be added to the JSON structure.
