Assistant:
I need to analyze the provided text and extract the required information according to the specified JSON format. However, there are some limitations with the provided text:

1. The text appears to be fragmented excerpts from a methods section of a scientific paper, not a complete document.
2. There is no clear disease context or specific gene being studied mentioned in the provided text.
3. The variant information is incomplete and appears to be cut off (e.g., "G309D constructs" without full context).
4. The text seems to describe experimental methods related to protein analysis, transfection, and possibly mitochondrial processing, but lacks complete information about the experimental design and results.

Given these limitations, I'll extract what information I can based on the provided text:

For Variants:
- There appears to be a mention of "G309D" constructs, which suggests a protein change from glycine to aspartic acid at position 309.
- However, the gene name, transcript reference, and cDNA change information are not complete in the provided text.

For Disease:
- No specific disease is mentioned in the provided text.

For Experimental Methods:
- There are mentions of transfection experiments with constructs
- There's a reference to measuring preprotein and mature protein levels
- mRNA levels were measured (with P = 0.23 by ANOVA, n = 3)
- There's a mention of autophosphorylation activity analysis using ANOVA with Fisher's PLSD post hoc test
- Coomassie-stained gels were used for protein quantification
- Immunoblotting (Western blot) was mentioned as a technique
- Mitochondrial processing peptidases are referenced

However, most of the specific information required by the JSON template is not available in the provided text. Based on the instructions to use "N.D." when information is not mentioned, I will provide this response.
