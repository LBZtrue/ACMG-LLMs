Based on the information provided in the text, the gene involved is SNCA (α-synuclein), and the variant is E46K (NM_000345.4:c.136G>A). The disease associated with this variant is Parkinson's disease, which corresponds to MONDO:0005180. The experimental method used is molecular dynamics simulations, utilizing recombinant α-syn and synthetic peptides from the GBD fragment. The readout type is quantitative, showing an abnormal result with a gain-of-function molecular effect. The E46K mutation caused a significant shift in π c values for both the protein and peptides. However, details on biological and technical replicates, controls, statistical methods, and thresholds are not provided in the text. The experimental method is recognized as approved for studying Parkinson's disease.
