The provided JSON output includes structured data extracted from the given literature context. The "LRRK2" gene is associated with "Parkinson disease" (MONDO:0005180). The variant c.6055G>T (p.V2019L) is standardized in HGVS nomenclature as NM_198578.5:c.6055G>T. Experimental methods include Western Blot analysis using HEK293 cells, with quantitative readouts of phosphorylation levels. Biological and technical replicates were performed, and statistical analysis was used to determine significance. The assay is approved for studying Parkinson disease, with thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts based on comparisons to wild-type LRRK2. All content not explicitly mentioned in the literature is marked as "N.D." as per the user's requirements.
