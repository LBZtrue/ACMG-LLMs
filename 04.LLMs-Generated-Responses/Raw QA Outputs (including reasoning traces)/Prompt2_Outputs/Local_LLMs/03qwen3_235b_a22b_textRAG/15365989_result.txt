``` To better align with the user's expectations, I will refine the JSON structure and ensure that the content is accurate and complete, adhering to the predefined format. I will standardize the HGVS nomenclature via API, retrieve disease terms from the MONDO database, and ensure that the "Readout description" includes all previously extracted variants. Additionally, I will check if the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease. Here is the refined JSON:
