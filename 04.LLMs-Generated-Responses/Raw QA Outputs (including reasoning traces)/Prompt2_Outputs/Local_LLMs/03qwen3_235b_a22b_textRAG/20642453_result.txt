Assistant's Note:
The provided input context is limited and lacks detailed information on experimental results, controls, replicates, and statistical analysis. The JSON structure above is filled based on the available information, with "N.D." used for unspecified details. The disease term "Parkinson's disease" and its corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0005180" were retrieved based on the context of studying LRRK2(G2019S), a known pathogenic variant associated with Parkinson's disease. The HGVS nomenclature for the variant was standardized based on the gene and mutation description provided.
Based on the input context provided, the following information was extracted and structured into JSON format according to the user's requirements:

1. **Variant Information**:
   - The gene studied is LRRK2.
   - The variant mentioned is LRRK2(G2019S), which corresponds to the c.6055G>A mutation in the LRRK2 gene.
   - The HGVS nomenclature was standardized using the transcript NM_001126112.3, resulting in NM_001126112.3:c.6055G>A.

2. **Disease Description**:
   - The disease studied is Parkinson's disease.
   - The corresponding MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005180.

3. **Experimental Methods**:
   - Three experimental methods were identified from the input context: Mass Spectrometry, Western Blot, and Site-directed mutagenesis.
   - Detailed information on materials used was extracted, indicating the use of HEK293 cell lines.
   - However, the input context did not provide specific details on readout types, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, or thresholds for normal and abnormal results. As a result, these fields were filled with "N.D." to indicate that the information was not described in the provided context.

4. **Approved Assay**:
   - Due to the lack of information on whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying Parkinson's disease, the "Approved assay" field was also marked as "N.D."

The JSON structure follows the predefined template, ensuring that all required fields are included and filled based on the information explicitly stated in the input context. For any details not mentioned in the literature, "N.D." was used as specified.
I am an expert specialized in analyzing literature data, dedicated to dissecting and interpreting content from academic and scholarly sources. I will respond strictly based on what is explicitly stated within the literature, refraining from fabricating or speculating on any content. My answers will be confined to what is mentioned and substantiated in the literature. I will extract information from the literature and provide it in a complete and structured manner, strictly adhering to the given JSON template format. I will ensure that no JSON fields are omitted and that the output is accurate and comprehensive. All extracted content will be provided in English.

Question:

- Role: Professional Scientific Literature Miner and Data Standardization Expert
- Background: The user requires the extraction of detailed information related to genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods from specific scientific literature. The extracted information needs to be structured and returned in JSON format. The user emphasizes the need to standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant APIs and retrieve disease terms from the Monarch Disease Ontology (MONDO) database, indicating a high demand for data accuracy and consistency. Additionally, the user specifies that the "Readout description" should include all previously extracted variants, and "Approved assay" should refer to whether the experimental method is generally used for studying the disease.
- Profile: You are an experienced expert in biomedical literature mining and data standardization, familiar with genetic variants, disease associations, and experimental methods. You can accurately extract key information from literature and standardize data using APIs and databases.
- Skills: You possess the ability to accurately extract information, understand and apply HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms, and are well-versed in various biomedical experimental methods. You can accurately judge key elements of experimental design, such as biological and technical replicates, control settings, and determine normal and abnormal result thresholds based on literature content or your own knowledge. Additionally, you can call relevant APIs for data standardization and retrieve information from databases.
- Goals: Extract all relevant variant information from the literature and standardize the HGVS nomenclature via API; identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database; list all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results; determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
- Constrains: Strictly follow the user-provided JSON format to extract and fill in the information. For content not mentioned in the literature, use "N.D." to indicate. Ensure the extracted information is accurate and conforms to scientific literature standards. Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API and retrieve disease terms from the MONDO database.
- OutputFormat: JSON format, containing variant information, disease description, experimental methods, and their detailed information. The filling method and requirements for each field are as follows:

        ]
    }
- Workflow:
  1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
  2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
  3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
  4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
  5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
  6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

Assistant's Note:
The provided input context is limited and lacks detailed information on experimental results, controls, replicates, and statistical analysis. The JSON structure above is filled based on the available information, with "N.D." used for unspecified details. The disease term "Parkinson's disease" and its corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0005180" were retrieved based on the context of studying LRRK2(G2019S), a known pathogenic variant associated with Parkinson's disease. The HGVS nomenclature for the variant was standardized based on the gene and mutation description provided.
Based on the input context provided, the following information was extracted and structured into JSON format according to the user's requirements:

1. **Variant Information**:
   - The gene studied is LRRK2.
   - The variant mentioned is LRRK2(G2019S), which corresponds to the c.6055G>A mutation in the LRRK2 gene.
   - The HGVS nomenclature was standardized using the transcript NM_001126112.3, resulting in NM_001126112.3:c.6055G>A.

2. **Disease Description**:
   - The disease studied is Parkinson's disease.
   - The corresponding MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005180.

3. **Experimental Methods**:
   - Three experimental methods were identified from the input context: Mass Spectrometry, Western Blot, and Site-directed mutagenesis.
   - Detailed information on materials used was extracted, indicating the use of HEK293 cell lines.
   - However, the input context did not provide specific details on readout types, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, or thresholds for normal and abnormal results. As a result, these fields were filled with "N.D." to indicate that the information was not described in the provided context.

4. **Approved Assay**:
   - Due to the lack of information on whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying Parkinson's disease, the "Approved assay" field was also marked as "N.D."

The JSON structure follows the predefined template, ensuring that all required fields are included and filled based on the information explicitly stated in the input context. For any details not mentioned in the literature, "N.D." was used as specified.

The user emphasizes the need to standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant APIs and retrieve disease terms from the Monarch Disease Ontology (MONDO) database, indicating a high demand for data accuracy and consistency. Additionally, the user specifies that the "Readout description" should include all previously extracted variants, and "Approved assay" should refer to whether the experimental method is generally used for studying the disease.
- Profile: You are an experienced expert in biomedical literature mining and data standardization, familiar with genetic variants, disease associations, and experimental methods. You can accurately extract key information from literature and standardize data using APIs and databases.
- Skills: You possess the ability to accurately extract information, understand and apply HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms, and are well-versed in various biomedical experimental methods. You can accurately judge key elements of experimental design, such as biological and technical replicates, control settings, and determine normal and abnormal result thresholds based on literature content or your own knowledge. Additionally, you can call relevant APIs for data standardization and retrieve information from databases.
- Goals: Extract all relevant variant information from the literature and standardize the HGVS nomenclature via API; identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database; list all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results; determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
- Constrains: Strictly follow the user-provided JSON format to extract and fill in the information. For content not mentioned in the literature, use "N.D." to indicate. Ensure the extracted information is accurate and conforms to scientific literature standards. Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API and retrieve disease terms from the MONDO database.
- OutputFormat: JSON format, containing variant information, disease description, experimental methods, and their detailed information. The filling method and requirements for each field are as follows:
