Based on the provided context, I've extracted and standardized information about a genetic variant, the associated disease, and experimental methods. Here's my analysis:

1. Variants:
- Gene: SNCA (Alpha-synuclein)
- Variant: A30P mutation
- Standardized HGVS: NM_000345.3:c.89G>C (which leads to p.A30P amino acid change)
- This mutation was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis

2. Disease:
- The disease studied appears to be Parkinson's disease, as alpha-synuclein mutations (including A30P) are associated with this condition
- MONDO term: MONDO:0005180 (Parkinson's disease)

3. Experimental Methods:
Two experimental methods were identified:

a) Western Blot:
- Material: PC12/TetOn cells expressing either wild-type alpha-synuclein (␣-syn(WT)) or the A30P mutant (␣-syn(A30P))
- Readout: Quantitative (expression levels measured by densitometric analysis)
- Replicates: Three replicates for each condition (both biological and technical)
- Controls: Wild-type ␣-syn(WT) served as positive control
- Statistical analysis: One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test
- Results: The variant showed abnormal expression patterns compared to wild-type
- Molecular effect: Gain-of-function (based on the observed effects)

b) Cell viability assessment:
- Material: Same PC12/TetOn cell system as above
- Readout: Quantitative (viability measured)
- Replicates: Three replicates for each condition
- Controls: Wild-type ␣-syn(WT) served as positive control
- Statistical analysis: One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test
- Results: The A30P variant showed significantly different viability compared to wild-type
- Molecular effect: Gain-of-function (based on the observed effects)

4. Assay Approval:
Both experimental methods are commonly used for studying Parkinson's disease mechanisms and alpha-synuclein pathophysiology.

A30P mutation in SNCA gene causes Parkinson's disease (MONDO:0005180). Two experimental methods were used to study the effects of this mutation: Western blot and cell viability assessment, both using PC12/TetOn cells expressing either wild-type or A30P mutant alpha-synuclein. Both methods used three replicates, appropriate controls, and standard statistical analyses. The A30P variant showed abnormal results in both assays, with a gain-of-function molecular effect.
