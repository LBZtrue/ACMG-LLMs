``` To address the task, we have conducted a detailed extraction and structuring of information from the literature provided. The data has been organized in a JSON format following the user's instructions and constraints. Below is an explanation of the key components of the solution:

### **1. Variant Information Extraction**
- **Gene**: DJ-1.
- **Variants**: Three pathogenic DJ-1 variants (L10P, L166P, and P158DEL) were identified from the literature.
- **HGVS Nomenclature Standardization**: The variants were standardized using HGVS nomenclature. For example, the L10P mutation corresponds to NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A at the DNA level and p.L10P at the protein level.
- **cDNA and Protein Changes**: For each variant, the transcript reference, nucleotide change, and protein change were detailed.
- **Description in Context**: Each variant was described as per its context in the literature.

### **2. Disease Description**
- **Disease Studied**: Parkinson’s disease was identified as the disease studied in the literature.
- **MONDO Term**: The corresponding MONDO term for Parkinson’s disease is MONDO:0005180.

### **3. Experimental Method Details**
- **Assay Method**: Western blot was used as the primary method to assess protein stability.
- **Material Used**: HEK293 cell lines were transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant DJ-1 proteins.
- **Readout Type**: Qualitative.
- **Readout Description**: The results indicated that all three pathogenic DJ-1 mutants showed reduced protein stability, partially due to proteasomal degradation.
- **Biological and Technical Replicates**: Information on biological and technical replicates was not explicitly mentioned in the literature, so they were marked as "N.D."
- **Positive and Negative Controls**: Wild-type DJ-1 served as a positive control, while an empty vector was used as a negative control.
- **Validation Controls**: Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were included (3 variants), but no controls for benign/likely benign (B/LB) variants were used.
- **Statistical Analysis Method**: GraphPad Prism 5.0 was used for statistical analysis.
- **Thresholds for Normal and Abnormal Readouts**: These were determined based on the literature and custom interpretation. Normal readout was defined as protein stability similar to wild-type DJ-1, while abnormal readout was defined as a significant reduction in stability compared to wild-type.
- **Approved Assay**: Western blot is a standard method used in the study of protein stability in Parkinson’s disease and was marked as "Yes."

### **4. JSON Output**
The final JSON output was structured according to the user’s requirements, ensuring that all fields were filled with the extracted information or marked as "N.D." when not present in the literature.
