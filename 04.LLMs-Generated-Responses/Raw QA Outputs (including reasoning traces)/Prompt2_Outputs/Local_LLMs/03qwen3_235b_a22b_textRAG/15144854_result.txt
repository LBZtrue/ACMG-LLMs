Several notes about this extraction:
1. The gene for α-synuclein is SNCA (alpha-synuclein), and the A53T mutation corresponds to c.158C>A at the cDNA level according to the standard reference sequence NM_000345.3.

2. The disease studied is Parkinson's disease, which corresponds to MONDO term MONDO:0005180 in the Monarch Disease Ontology.

3. For several fields, the information was not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so "N.D." was used as requested.

4. The experimental methods described in the text were Western blot, sequential extraction and SDS-PAGE analysis, and fibril formation assays.

5. Based on the context provided, the experimental methods mentioned are generally accepted assays for studying Parkinson's disease and α-synuclein pathology.

6. The molecular effect was interpreted as "gain-of-function" since the A53T mutation causes increased aggregation of α-synuclein, which is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease pathology.
