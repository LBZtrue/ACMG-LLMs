Based on the provided context and abstract, I have analyzed the literature and extracted the relevant information to fill the JSON template. Here's my structured response:

1. Variant Information:
- The literature describes a novel homozygous missense mutation in DJ-1 gene resulting in E163K amino acid substitution
- Using the HGVS nomenclature standardization, this corresponds to NM_007262.4:c.487G>A

2. Disease Description:
- The disease studied is Parkinson's disease
- The corresponding MONDO term is MONDO:0005180

3. Experimental Methods:
I identified three experimental approaches in the literature:
- Western Blot analysis
- Subcellular Fractionation
- Protein Stability Assay (implied by the time course experiment with H2O2 treatment)

For each experimental method, I extracted detailed information including materials used, readout types, controls, and other relevant parameters as specified in the JSON template.

The literature mentions that experiments were shown in duplicates (technical replicates) and that results were plotted as percentage of protein over time standardized to the 0 hrs time point (indicating biological replicates for the protein stability assay).

As no specific statistical analysis methods were mentioned in the provided text, those fields are marked as "N.D.".

The thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts were determined based on standard scientific interpretation since they weren't explicitly stated in the provided text.

The literature focuses on studying DJ-1 mutations linked to familial Parkinson's disease, and the experimental methods used are standard approaches for studying protein function and localization in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, I marked "Approved assay" as "Yes" for all methods.
