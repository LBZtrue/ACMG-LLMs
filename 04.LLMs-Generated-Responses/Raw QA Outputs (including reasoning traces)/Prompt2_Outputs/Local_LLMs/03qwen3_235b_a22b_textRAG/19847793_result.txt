I have attempted to extract the limited information provided, but must note that the input appears to be fragments from a larger document rather than a complete scientific paper. Many fields had to be marked as "N.D." (Not Described) due to lack of information in the provided text.

Key points extracted:
1. Two PINK1 variants were mentioned: c.203G>C (p.R68P) and c.1573C>A (p.D525N)
2. The disease studied appears to be Parkinson's disease
3. Two experimental methods were referenced: site-directed mutagenesis and overexpression experiments in HEK293 cells
4. No specific results, controls, replicates or statistical methods could be extracted due to insufficient information in the provided text
I have structured the response according to the required JSON format.
