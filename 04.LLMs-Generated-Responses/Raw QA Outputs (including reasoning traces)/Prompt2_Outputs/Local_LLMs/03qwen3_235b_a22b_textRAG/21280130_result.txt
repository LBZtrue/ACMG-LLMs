Based on the provided literature content and the user's requirements, I have extracted and structured the relevant information into the specified JSON format. The literature describes three disease-associated mutations (A30P, E46K, A53T) in the SNCA gene, which are linked to Parkinson's disease (MONDO:0005180). The experimental method used is NMR spectroscopy on recombinant α-synuclein protein. The study found that the A30P mutation does not induce a conformational change in α-synuclein aggregates, suggesting that the increased pathogenicity related to this mutation is unlikely to be caused by such a change. Due to the limited information in the provided literature snippet, many fields are marked as "N.D." (not described). The HGVS nomenclature for the variants was standardized, and the disease term was retrieved from the MONDO database. The experimental method (NMR spectroscopy) is considered an approved assay for studying Parkinson's disease.
