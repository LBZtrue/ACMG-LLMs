### Response to User Feedback

You provided feedback that the following JSON segment:
```json
"Protein Change": {
    "ref": "G",
    "alt": "D",
    "position": 83
}
```
should instead be:
```json
"Protein Change": {
    "ref": "R",
    "alt": "W",
    "position": 111
}
```

This suggests that the literature you referenced contains a variant where the reference amino acid is arginine (R) at position 111, which is substituted with tryptophan (W). The earlier entry mistakenly used glycine (G) at position 83.

### Explanation of Changes

- **Protein Change Correction:** The amino acid at position 111 was updated from glycine (G) to arginine (R) as the reference residue, and the alternative residue was changed to tryptophan (W), aligning with your correction.
- **Consistency:** All other parts of the JSON were left intact as they were consistent with the literature context you provided.

If you have additional variants or further corrections, I can update the JSON accordingly. Please provide the relevant literature excerpts or data to ensure accurate standardization.

### Summary of Updates

- **HGVS Update:** Changed from `NM_007262.3:c.248G>A` to `NM_007262.3:c.331C>T`, aligning with the corrected protein change (R111W).
- **Protein Change Update:** Confirmed the amino acid change from arginine (R) to tryptophan (W) at position 111.
- **Variant Description Consistency:** Maintained the same literature excerpt in the `"Description in input context"` field to reflect the original context while correcting the HGVS nomenclature and protein change.

Please review this updated JSON and confirm if further modifications are needed.

### Final Summary of Updates

- **HGVS Correction:** Confirmed the variant as `NM_007262.3:c.331C>T`, which corresponds to the protein change R111W.
- **Protein Change Update:** Confirmed the amino acid change from arginine (R) to tryptophan (W) at position 111.
- **Variant Description Consistency:** Maintained the same literature excerpt in the `"Description in input context"` field to reflect the original context while correcting the HGVS nomenclature and protein change.
- **Disease Ontology Mapping:** Verified the disease term "Parkinson's disease" with the corresponding MONDO ID: `MONDO:0005180`.
- **Experimental Methods:** Maintained the structure of the three experimental methods (Western Blot, MTT assay, and Isoelectric focusing) with the relevant material sources, readout types, and controls.

If you have any additional information or further corrections, please provide the relevant context or literature excerpts so I can ensure the JSON remains accurate and consistent.
