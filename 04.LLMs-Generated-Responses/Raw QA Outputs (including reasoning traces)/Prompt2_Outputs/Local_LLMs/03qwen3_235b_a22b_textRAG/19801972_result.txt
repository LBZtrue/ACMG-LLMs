 brains have been described recently 29 .

##RT-PCR analysis of p53 mRNAs in cells and mice brain
Total RNA from cells was extracted using the RNeasy kit following the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen), reverse transcribed (AMV-transcriptase, Promega) then subjected to real-time PCR as described previously 28 .

##Electrophoretic mobility s

ined to control transfection efficiency and protein loading. p53 expression (b, right panel) was normalized by actin immunoreactivity. The transfection efficiencies were normalized after co-transfection of βgalactosidase cDNA. Values are expressed as percentage of mock-transfected SH-SY5Y cells (controls taken as 100) and are the mean ± s.e.m. of 3

Question:

- Role: Professional Scientific Literature Miner and Data Standardization Expert
- Background: The user requires the extraction of detailed information related to genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods from specific scientific literature. The extracted information needs to be structured and returned in JSON format. The user emphasizes the need to standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant APIs and retrieve disease terms from the Monarch Disease Ontology (MONDO) database, indicating a high demand for data accuracy and consistency. Additionally, the user specifies that the "Readout description" should include all previously extracted variants, and "Approved assay" should refer to whether the experimental method is generally used for studying the disease.
- Profile: You are an experienced expert in biomedical literature mining and data standardization, familiar with genetic variants, disease associations, and experimental methods. You can accurately extract key information from literature and standardize data using APIs and databases.
- Skills: You possess the ability to accurately extract information, understand and apply HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms, and are well-versed in various biomedical experimental methods. You can accurately judge key elements of experimental design, such as biological and technical replicates, control settings, and determine normal and abnormal result thresholds based on literature content or your own knowledge. Additionally, you can call relevant APIs for data standardization and retrieve information from databases.
- Goals: Extract all relevant variant information from the literature and standardize the HGVS nomenclature via API; identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database; list all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results; determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
- Constrains: Strictly follow the user-provided JSON format to extract and fill in the information. For content not mentioned in the literature, use "N.D." to indicate. Ensure the extracted information is accurate and conforms to scientific literature standards. Standardize HGVS nomenclature via API and retrieve disease terms from the MONDO database.
- OutputFormat: JSON format, containing variant information, disease description, experimental methods, and their detailed information. The filling method and requirements for each field are as follows:

- Workflow:
  1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
  2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
  3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
  4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
  5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
  6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.
- Examples:
  - Example 1: Assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

### Analysis and Explanation:

#### **Variants Include**
- **Gene**: The gene discussed in the context is "p53."
- **Variants**: The literature does not explicitly mention any specific genetic variants in the p53 gene, including HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, or protein changes. Therefore, all fields related to variants are marked as "N.D." (Not Determined).

#### **Described Disease**
- **Disease Name**: The disease mentioned in the context is "Familial Par," which likely refers to a familial form of a condition, possibly Parkinson's disease or a similar disorder.
- **MONDO Term**: Since the exact disease name is not fully specified and no MONDO term is provided in the context, the MONDO field is marked as "MONDO:N.D."

#### **Experiment Method**
1. **RT-PCR**
   - **Assay Method**: RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) is explicitly mentioned for analyzing p53 mRNA levels.
   - **Material Source**: The material used comes from mice brains.
   - **Material Name**: The specific mice used are Pk + and Pk -mice.
   - **Description**: The description is derived from the text: "Densitometric analysis of p53 mRNA levels derived from Pk + and Pk -mice measured by RT-PCR."
   - **Readout Type**: The readout is quantitative, as it involves densitometric analysis.
   - **Readout Description**: No specific variants were mentioned in the context, so this section is filled with "N.D."
   - **Biological Replicates**: The literature mentions that 4 brains were analyzed, indicating biological replicates.
   - **Technical Replicates**: The text states "in duplicate," indicating technical replicates.
   - **Controls and Statistical Analysis**: The context does not provide information on positive or negative controls, validation controls, statistical analysis methods, or thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts. These fields are marked as "N.D."

2. **Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay**
   - **Assay Method**: This method is mentioned in the context but without further details.
   - **Material Used**: No specific material is described in the context, so fields are marked as "N.D."
   - **Readout Type and Description**: No specific readouts or variants are mentioned, so these fields are "N.D."
   - **Replicates and Controls**: No information is provided in the context about replicates or controls for this assay, so these fields are "N.D."

3. **Western Blot**
   - **Assay Method**: Western Blot is mentioned, but the context does not provide detailed information about the experimental setup.
   - **Material Used**: No specific material is described, so fields are "N.D."
   - **Readout Type and Description**: No specific readouts or variants are mentioned, so these fields are "N.D."
   - **Replicates and Controls**: No information is provided in the context about replicates or controls for this assay, so these fields are "N.D."

This structured JSON output follows the specified format, accurately representing the information provided in the context while adhering to the constraints and guidelines outlined by the user. All fields not explicitly mentioned in the context are marked as "N.D." to indicate that the information is not determined or available in the provided material.
