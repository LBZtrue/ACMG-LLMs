2. Disease description for Parkinsonism with MONDO term
3. Experimental methods including:
   - Transgenic Drosophila model
   - Climbing assay

For each experimental method, I have included detailed information about:
- Material sources and descriptions
- Readout types and descriptions for each variant
- Biological and technical replicates
- Control settings
- Statistical analysis methods
- Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts
- Whether the assay is approved/generally used for studying the disease

The response follows the exact JSON structure and field requirements specified in the instructions.

   - Climbing assay

For each experimental method, I have included detailed information about:
- Material sources and descriptions
- Readout types and descriptions for each variant
- Biological and technical replicates
- Control settings
- Statistical analysis methods
- Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts
- Whether the assay is approved/generally used for studying the disease

The response follows the exact JSON structure and field requirements specified in the instructions.
