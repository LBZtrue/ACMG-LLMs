I need to extract information from the provided text and organize it into a JSON format according to the specified schema.

Let me analyze the text:

1. Genetic variants:
   - G2019S mutant LRRK2
   - I2020T mutant LRRK2
   - R1441C mutant LRRK2

2. Disease:
   Based on the variants mentioned, which are all LRRK2 mutations, and the experimental context, the disease being studied is Parkinson disease.

3. Experimental methods:
   - In vitro phosphorylation assay
   - Western analysis
   - In vitro GST pull-down assay

I'll now extract and format the information according to the JSON schema:

For the variants, I'll need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. Assuming NM_198578.4 is the reference transcript for LRRK2:

1. G2019S: NM_198578.4:c.6055G>A
2. I2020T: NM_198578.4:c.6059T>C
3. R1441C: NM_198578.4:c.4321C>T

For the disease, Parkinson disease corresponds to MONDO:0005180 in the MONDO database.

Now I'll format all the information into the required JSON structure:
