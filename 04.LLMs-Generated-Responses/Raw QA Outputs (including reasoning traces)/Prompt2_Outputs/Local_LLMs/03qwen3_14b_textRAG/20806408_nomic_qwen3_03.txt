Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract detailed information from the provided scientific literature about genetic variants, the associated disease, and the experimental methods used. They specified a JSON format with specific fields, and they want HGVS nomenclature standardized via an API and MONDO terms for the disease. Alright, first I need to parse the literature thoroughly.

Looking at the abstract and introduction, the variants mentioned are L10P and P158DEL in the DJ-1 gene. The disease is Parkinson's, specifically autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism. I need to confirm the MONDO term for that. The variants are missense and deletion, so I need to get their HGVS nomenclature. However, the literature doesn't provide transcript numbers, which are necessary for HGVS. Since the user mentioned using an API for standardization, but the input doesn't have transcript IDs, I might have to note that as N.D. unless I can infer it, but I shouldn't assume. So, the HGVS would be incomplete without the transcript, so I'll use N.D. for the transcript and position where needed.

Next, the experimental methods. The study assessed protein stability, dimerization, solubility, subcellular localization, and protective function. The methods likely include techniques like Western blot for protein stability, size-exclusion chromatography for solubility and dimerization, and cell-based assays for toxicity. I need to list each method, materials used (like cell lines expressing the variants), readout types (quantitative for protein stability, etc.), and details about replicates and controls. The literature mentions proteasome inhibitors and MG-132, so that's part of the experimental setup. However, the exact methods like Western blot or chromatography aren't explicitly named, so I'll have to infer based on the descriptions.

For the disease, I need to find the MONDO term for autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism. I'll look up MONDO and find the appropriate term, maybe MONDO:0005305 or similar. The variants are pathogenic, so the readout descriptions should include the variants and their effects. The experimental methods may not have explicit statistical analysis methods mentioned, so those would be N.D. unless I can infer from standard practices.

I also need to check if the methods are generally used for studying Parkinson's. Techniques like Western blot and size-exclusion chromatography are standard in protein stability and dimerization studies, so "Approved assay" would be Yes. However, the specific assays mentioned in the literature might not be common for Parkinson's, but the general methods are.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the variants with their details, the disease with MONDO term, and each experimental method with all the required fields. Where information isn't present in the literature, I'll use N.D. or infer based on standard practices, noting the source as "Custom" if needed.
