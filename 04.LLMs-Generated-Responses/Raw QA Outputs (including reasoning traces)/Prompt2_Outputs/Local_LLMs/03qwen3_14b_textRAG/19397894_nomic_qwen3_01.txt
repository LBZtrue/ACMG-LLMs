Okay, I need to extract information from the given scientific literature about genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, the variants mentioned are I2020T and G2019S in the LRRK2 gene. The article discusses their effects on kinase activity and inhibitor sensitivity. The user wants the HGVS nomenclature standardized, so I'll need to check if those variants are already in the correct format. The text refers to them as I2020T and G2019S, but I should verify if they are in the transcript-specific format like NM_...:c.2020T or similar. However, the literature doesn't provide transcript numbers, so I might have to note that as N.D. unless I can infer from standard nomenclature, but I shouldn't assume. The user mentioned using an API for standardization, but since I can't access external APIs, I'll have to use the information given and mark it as N.D. if necessary.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. From my knowledge, MONDO:0005302 is the term for Parkinson's disease. I'll include that in the Described Disease section.

For the experimental methods, the article mentions binding assays and enzymatic assays. Specifically, they used binding assays to measure ATP affinity and in vitro kinase activity assays. The material used isn't explicitly named, so I'll have to put N.D. for Material Name and Source unless the text mentions something like cell lines or recombinant proteins. The text says "using an in vitro kinase activity assay," so the Material Source might be recombinant proteins or cell-free systems, but since it's not specified, I'll use N.D.

Readout types: The binding assays would be quantitative (measuring ATP affinity), and the kinase activity assays are also quantitative (measuring inhibitor sensitivity). The Readout description needs to include both variants. The conclusion for I2020T is that it has lower ATP affinity (25% vs. 50% for wild-type) and reduced inhibitor sensitivity (50% vs. 100% for wild-type). For G2019S, it's higher ATP affinity (75% vs. 50%) and increased inhibitor sensitivity (150% vs. 100%). Molecular effects might be "gain-of-function" or "loss-of-function," but the text doesn't specify. The article states that the variants affect kinase activity and inhibitor sensitivity, but without more context, I'll have to use N.D. for molecular effect unless inferred.

Replicates: The text doesn't mention biological or technical replicates, so those fields will be N.D. Similarly, controls aren't explicitly mentioned, so basic positive/negative controls and validation controls would be N.D. Statistical analysis methods aren't described either, so that's N.D.

Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts: The article doesn't provide specific thresholds, so I'll use N.D. for those, but the user said if not in the literature, determine based on own knowledge. However, without specific data, it's safer to use N.D. unless I can infer from standard practices. For example, in binding assays, a threshold might be based on binding affinity percentages, but without explicit info, it's better to leave as N.D.

Approved assay: The methods used (binding and kinase assays) are standard in pharmacology and biochemistry, so I can mark Approved assay as Yes.

Putting it all together, I need to structure the JSON with the variants, disease, and experiments as per the example, filling in N.D. where information isn't present.
