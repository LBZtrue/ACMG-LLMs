Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from a scientific paper about genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods, then structure it in a specific JSON format. First, I need to read through the provided literature thoroughly.

The paper discusses the E46K mutation in α-synuclein and its effect on amyloid fibril formation. The key variants mentioned are E46K and A53T, and also Glu83 to Lys or Ala. I need to identify these variants, standardize their HGVS nomenclature, and retrieve the disease term from MONDO. 

Wait, the disease here is Parkinson's disease, right? Because α-synuclein mutations are linked to Parkinson's. I'll have to check MONDO for the correct term. The paper mentions that the findings support the notion that aberrant α-synuclein polymerization leads to pathological inclusions causing disease. So the disease is Parkinson's disease, and the MONDO ID should be MONDO:0005347.

Now for the variants. The E46K mutation is in the α-synuclein gene (SNCA). The paper says E46K and A53T. Also, Glu83 to Lys or Ala. But the user's example uses HGVS nomenclature, so I need to get the transcript and positions. However, the literature doesn't provide the transcript IDs or exact nucleotide changes. The paper only mentions the amino acid changes. Since the user requires standardization via API, but without specific transcript info, I might have to note that as N.D. But wait, the user might expect me to use the standard transcript for SNCA. Let me check. The most common transcript for SNCA is NM_000345.3. So for E46K, that would be c.137A>G (since Glu is GAA, and K is AAA, so A to G at position 137). Similarly, A53T would be c.158C>A (Ala to Thr, C to A at position 158). Glu83 to Lys would be c.248G>A (Glu is GAA, Lys is AAA, so G to A at position 248). Glu83 to Ala would be c.248G>C (since Ala is GCA, so G to C at position 248). However, the paper doesn't specify the exact nucleotide changes, just the amino acids. So I should note that the HGVS nomenclature requires more detailed info, but based on standard transcripts, I can infer the positions. But maybe the user expects me to use the information as given, even if it's not complete. Hmm.

Next, the experimental methods. The paper doesn't mention specific assays like Western Blot or any controls. It describes the effect of the mutations on fibril formation, but the methods section might not be detailed enough. The user's example includes controls, replicates, etc., but the literature here doesn't provide that information. So I'll have to mark those as N.D. or state that the information isn't present in the text.

For the "Approved assay" field, since the study is about amyloid fibril formation, common methods like Thioflavin T assays or electron microscopy might be used, but the paper doesn't specify. So I'll have to say N.D. unless I can infer a standard method.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will have the variants with inferred HGVS nomenclature, the disease term from MONDO, and the experimental methods with N.D. where details are missing. I need to be careful not to assume information not present in the text, even if it's standard practice. The user might expect that, but the instructions say to extract based on the literature provided. So I'll proceed accordingly.
