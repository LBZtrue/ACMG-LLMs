Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a detailed JSON extraction from the given scientific literature about the E46K mutation in alpha-synuclein. First, I need to identify all the genetic variants mentioned. The text mentions E46K and A53T mutations in alpha-synuclein. Also, there's a substitution of Glu46 to Ala and Glu83 to Lys or Ala.

Next, I have to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. Since the paper doesn't provide transcript IDs, I might need to assume standard ones. However, without specific transcript information, I can't fully standardize. The user mentioned using APIs, but without that data, I'll note it as N.D. for now.

For the disease, the context refers to amyloid fibril formation related to Parkinson's disease, but the exact MONDO term isn't specified. I'll need to look up MONDO for Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005313.

Now, the experimental methods. The paper discusses fibrillization assays, likely involving protein aggregation studies. The methods include comparing the propensity of different mutations to form amyloid fibrils. The materials might be recombinant proteins or cell lines expressing the variants. The readouts are the formation of amyloid fibrils, quantified by techniques like Thioflavin T assays or electron microscopy. The results mention increased fibrillization with E46K and A53T, but different ultrastructures with Ala substitutions. However, the literature doesn't specify exact experimental methods like Western blot or specific assays, so I'll note that as N.D.

For the JSON structure, I'll list the variants with their descriptions, map the disease to MONDO, and detail the experiments as per the information available, using N.D. where data isn't present. Also, the "Approved assay" would be N.D. since the specific methods aren't standard assays for the disease mentioned.
