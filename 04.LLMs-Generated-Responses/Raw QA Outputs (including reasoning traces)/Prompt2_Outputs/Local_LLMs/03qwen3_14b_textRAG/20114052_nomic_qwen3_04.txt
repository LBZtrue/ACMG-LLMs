Okay, let's start by reading the provided literature carefully. The user wants me to extract specific information about genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods from the given text. 

First, I need to identify the genetic variant mentioned. The article discusses the E46K mutation in α-synuclein. I should note the gene name, which is SNCA (since α-synuclein is encoded by the SNCA gene). The mutation is E46K, which corresponds to a substitution from Glutamic acid (E) to Lysine (K) at position 46. The HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. However, the literature doesn't provide the transcript ID, so I might have to use a placeholder or note that it's not specified. But the user mentioned using APIs for standardization, so maybe I can infer the transcript based on common knowledge. The most common transcript for SNCA is NM_000340.3. The cDNA change would be from G to A at position 137 (since E is encoded by G and K by A in the codon). The protein change is E46K, which would be p.E46K. 

Next, the disease associated with this variant is Parkinson's disease (PD). I need to find the MONDO term for PD. From what I remember, the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005323. 

Now, moving on to the experimental methods. The article mentions several methods. The main one is the use of planar lipid bilayers to study ion channel formation. The materials used include recombinant α-synuclein proteins (wild-type and E46K mutant), gangliosides like GM3 and GM1, and phosphatidylcholine bilayers. The readout types are quantitative, as they measure ion channel conductance, selectivity, and response to voltage. The readout descriptions should include the variants. For the E46K variant, the results show that channels formed are less conductive, more selective for cations, and have asymmetrical responses. When GM3 is present, the effects are altered. 

The article doesn't mention biological or technical replicates explicitly, so those fields might be N.D. Controls include using wild-type as a positive control and mutant as a negative, but the text says "basic positive control" and "basic negative control" are not explicitly set up. Validation controls for pathogenic and benign variants are not discussed here. Statistical analysis methods are not specified, but since they are measuring conductance, they might use ANOVA or t-tests. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren't mentioned in the literature, so I'll have to use standard thresholds based on my knowledge. For example, normal could be a certain conductance level, and abnormal might be a significant decrease. Approved assay would be whether planar lipid bilayers are commonly used for PD studies. I think they are, so "Yes".

I need to structure all this into the JSON format as per the user's example. Make sure each section is filled correctly, using the literature's text where possible and filling in gaps with standard practices when necessary.
