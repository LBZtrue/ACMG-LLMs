Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature. The user wants me to extract variant information, disease details, and experimental methods in a structured JSON format. First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The text mentions the LRRK2 gene and specifically the G2019S mutation. The description says it's responsible for about 40% of familial PD cases in North African Arabs and up to 30% in Ashkenazi Jews. 

Next, I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. The variant is G2019S, which is a substitution from glycine to serine at position 2019. The gene is LRRK2, so the HGVS would be something like NM_001126113.4:c.6056G>A (assuming the correct transcript ID). However, I should check the transcript number via an API, but since I can't access external resources, I'll note that as a placeholder.

For the disease, the text refers to Parkinson disease (PD). I need to find the MONDO term for PD. From prior knowledge, MONDO:0005236 is Parkinson disease. 

Now, the experimental methods. The text doesn't explicitly describe any experiments or assays. It only mentions the prevalence of the mutation. So, there might be no experimental methods to extract. However, the user's example includes a placeholder, so I'll have to indicate that no experiments were mentioned, leading to N.D. for all those fields.

Putting it all together: the variants include LRRK2 with the G2019S mutation. The disease is Parkinson disease with the MONDO term. Since there are no experimental methods described, all related fields in the JSON will be N.D. or have empty descriptions. The approved assay would be N.D. because there's no mention of any assay being used for studying PD in the text provided.
