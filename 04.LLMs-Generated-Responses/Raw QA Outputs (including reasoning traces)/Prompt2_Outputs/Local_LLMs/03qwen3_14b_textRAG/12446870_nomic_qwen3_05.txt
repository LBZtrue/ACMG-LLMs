Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract specific information from a scientific paper with DOI 10.1126/science.1077209. The paper is about a gene associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism, specifically the DJ-1 gene. 

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The title mentions mutations in the DJ-1 gene, but the abstract or main text isn't provided. Since the user's example includes variants like c.248G>A, but the actual paper might have different variants. However, the user's context doesn't provide the full text, so I might have to infer based on the title and the DOI. Wait, the title says "Mutations in the DJ-1 Gene" but doesn't specify the exact variants. Since the user's example is hypothetical, maybe in the actual paper, there are specific mutations listed. But without the full text, I can't extract the exact variants. However, the user might expect that based on the title, we can assume some variants, but the instructions say to only use what's explicitly stated. Since the given context doesn't have the variants, I should put N.D. for variants.

Next, the disease. The title mentions "Early-Onset Parkinsonism" which is a type of Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005312. But the exact disease here is autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism. I need to check MONDO for that specific term. Maybe it's a subcategory. Let me think: Parkinson's disease, autosomal recessive, early-onset might be MONDO:0005312, but I should confirm. However, without access to the MONDO database, I'll have to rely on known terms. The main disease here is Parkinson's disease, so I'll use MONDO:0005312.

For the experiments, the given context talks about DNA repair and gene expression, but the actual paper might have different methods. The user's example includes Western Blot, but the provided context doesn't mention any specific experimental methods. The text in the context is about DNA repair and gene expression, but no assays are described. Therefore, the experimental methods section would be N.D. as well.

The user's example includes details about replicates, controls, etc., but since the actual paper's methods aren't provided here, all those fields should be N.D. or not applicable.

So, putting it all together, the JSON would have N.D. for variants, the disease as Parkinson's with MONDO:0005312, and experiments as N.D. because the necessary details aren't present in the provided context.
