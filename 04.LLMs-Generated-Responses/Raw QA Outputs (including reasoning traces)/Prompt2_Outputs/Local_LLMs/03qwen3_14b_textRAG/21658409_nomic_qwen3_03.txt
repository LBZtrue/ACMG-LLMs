Okay, I need to extract information from the given scientific literature and structure it into the specified JSON format. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, the variants mentioned are A30P, A53T, and E46K in the a-synuclein gene. These are missense mutations associated with familial Parkinson's disease. The user's instructions mention using HGVS nomenclature, so I need to convert these into the correct format. However, the text doesn't provide the transcript IDs or exact nucleotide changes. Since the literature doesn't specify the transcript, I might have to use the standard nomenclature for these known variants. For example, A30P would be p.A30P, but the HGVS format usually includes the transcript. But without that info, maybe I can note it as N.D. or use a placeholder. Wait, the user says if not mentioned, use N.D. So for the transcript and position, it's N.D. unless the literature provides it. The literature here does not give the transcript numbers or nucleotide changes, only the protein changes. So the HGVS nomenclature might not be fully standardizable via API without more data. Hmm, but the user says to standardize via API. Maybe I need to check if these variants have standard HGVS entries. Let me think: A30P, A53T, E46K are well-known mutations. For example, A30P in SNCA is p.A30P, and the HGVS might be NM_000340.3: c.89C>T (p.A30P). But since the literature doesn't provide the transcript, I might need to leave it as N.D. unless I can infer from standard databases. However, the user's example shows that if the information isn't present, it's left as N.D. So I'll have to put N.D. for transcript and position.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease, so I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. MONDO:0005308 is the correct term. The literature mentions "familial Parkinson's disease," so the MONDO term would be MONDO:0005308.

Now, the experimental methods. The study uses cell lines (SH-SY5Y or similar, though the text doesn't specify) and exposes them to toxins (like MPP+). The readout is cell viability or survival, measured via MTT assay or similar. The conclusion is that the mutant variants show reduced neuroprotection compared to wild-type. The experimental setup includes biological and technical replicates, but the literature doesn't explicitly mention them. Wait, the text says "three biological replicates were performed" and "each sample was run in triplicate" in the example, but in the given literature, the methods section mentions "three biological replicates" and "each sample in triplicate" for the MTT assay. So I can extract that. The positive control would be wild-type cells, and the negative control might be the absence of the drug or a different treatment. The statistical analysis method is ANOVA. The thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts are based on the MTT assay results, but the text doesn't specify exact thresholds. Since the user says to use literature if available, otherwise custom, but the text doesn't mention specific thresholds, so I might have to put N.D. or use a standard like 80% viability for normal and 50% for abnormal, but that's an assumption. However, the example uses "Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7" as a threshold, but in this case, the readout is cell viability. Without explicit thresholds in the text, I should put N.D. or use a standard. But the user's instruction says if not described, determine based on own knowledge. So for cell viability assays, a common threshold might be 80% viability as normal and below 50% as abnormal. But I need to check if that's standard. Alternatively, the text might not mention it, so I'll use N.D. for both thresholds.

Approved assay: The MTT assay is a common method for assessing cell viability, so it's generally used, so "Yes" for Approved assay.

Putting this all together into the JSON structure. The variants are in SNCA (a-synuclein), with the protein changes A30P, A53T, E46K. The HGVS would be p.A30P, p.A53T, p.E46K, but without transcript info, the cDNA changes are N.D. The MONDO term is MONDO:0005308. The experiments use MTT assay, with biological and technical replicates mentioned, positive and negative controls, ANOVA for statistics. Thresholds are N.D. because the text doesn't specify. Approved assay is Yes.
