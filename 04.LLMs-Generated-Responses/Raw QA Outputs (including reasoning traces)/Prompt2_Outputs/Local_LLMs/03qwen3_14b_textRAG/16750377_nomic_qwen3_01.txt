Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature. The main focus is on the role of kinase activity in the toxic effects of mutant LRRK2/dardarin in Parkinson's disease. The authors mention that mutations in the LRRK2 gene, which codes for dardarin, are linked to dominant inherited Parkinson's disease. They found that pathogenic mutations increase inclusion body formation and cause cell death in neurons. Replacing the kinase domain with a kinase-dead version blocked inclusion bodies and delayed cell death, suggesting kinase inhibitors could be therapeutic.

First, I need to extract the genetic variants. The literature mentions mutations in the LRRK2 gene, but specific variants aren't listed with HGVS nomenclature. The text doesn't provide exact cDNA changes or protein changes, so I'll have to note that as N.D. since the user specified to use N.D. for missing info.

Next, the disease described is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. From my knowledge, the MONDO ID for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005222. I'll confirm that.

For the experimental methods, the study used cell lines (neuronal cell lines) and human midbrain neurons. The methods include expressing mutant dardarin, manipulating kinase activity by replacing the kinase domain, and observing inclusion body formation and cell death. The readout types are qualitative (presence of inclusion bodies) and quantitative (cell death). The materials used are neuronal cell lines and human neurons. The controls might be wild-type cells or kinase-dead versions. The statistical methods aren't explicitly mentioned, so I'll use N.D. for that. The threshold for normal and abnormal results would be based on the presence/absence of inclusion bodies and cell death rates, but since the literature doesn't specify exact thresholds, I'll use N.D. again. The approved assay part is tricky; since the study is about kinase activity and cell death, methods like Western blot or immunofluorescence are commonly used, but the literature doesn't specify, so I'll put N.D.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format as per the user's instructions. Each section should be filled with the extracted info or N.D. where not present. Make sure to check the examples provided to match the structure exactly.
