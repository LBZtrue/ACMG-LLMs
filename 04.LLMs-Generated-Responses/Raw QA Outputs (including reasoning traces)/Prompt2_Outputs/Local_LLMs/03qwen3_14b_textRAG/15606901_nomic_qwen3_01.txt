Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a detailed extraction from the provided literature about parkin mutations in Parkinson's disease, structured in JSON with specific fields. First, I need to parse the literature to find all the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract mentions C-terminal deletions and four N-terminal missense mutations in the UBL domain. However, the exact HGVS nomenclature isn't provided in the text. Since the user requires standardizing HGVS via API, but I don't have access to that here, I'll note that as N.D. for now.

Next, the disease is clearly Parkinson's disease. I need to retrieve the MONDO term for Parkinson's. I know MONDO:0005318 is the correct term for Parkinson's disease, but I'll verify that. 

For the experimental methods, the study characterizes mutants using techniques like Western blot or immunoblotting, as they discuss protein stability, degradation by proteasome, and the presence of a 42 kDa species. The materials used are human brain extracts and cultured cells. The readouts include protein stability, aggregation, and proteasome degradation. The methods don't mention specific replicates or controls, so those fields will be N.D. unless inferred from the context.

The variants section needs to include the C-terminal deletion and the four UBL missense mutations. Since the exact nucleotide changes aren't given, their HGVS will be N.D. The description in the input context would be as stated in the literature.

For the experiment methods, I'll list techniques like Western blot, immunoblotting, and proteasome assays. Each method's readout type is qualitative or quantitative based on the results described. Since the literature doesn't specify replicates or controls, those will be N.D. The approved assay for studying Parkinson's would be Yes, as these are standard methods.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should reflect the variants, disease with MONDO term, and experimental methods with their details, using N.D. where information isn't present in the literature.
