Okay, I need to extract the information from the provided scientific literature about the A30P mutation in a-synuclein and its relation to Parkinson's disease. Let's start by reading through the abstract and introduction carefully.

First, the article mentions the A30P mutation in a-synuclein (aS). The gene here is SNCA, right? Because a-synuclein is encoded by the SNCA gene. The variant is A30P, which refers to the substitution of alanine (A) at position 30 with proline (P) in the protein. I need to convert this into HGVS nomenclature. But wait, the literature doesn't provide the transcript ID, so I might have to note that as N.D. unless I can infer it. However, the user wants me to standardize via API, but since I don't have access to that, I'll have to use the information given. The variant is described as A30P, which in HGVS would be something like NM_001126112.3:c.90G>C (since position 30 in the protein is codon 90, assuming the transcript is NM_001126112.3). But I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, the user might expect me to use the information from the literature as is, even if the transcript isn't specified. The problem is the literature doesn't mention the transcript, so the cDNA change and protein change would be based on the text.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. From what I remember, MONDO:0005317 is the term for Parkinson's disease.

For the experimental methods, the article mentions quenched hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to NMR spectroscopy and two-dimensional proton-detected high-resolution magic angle spinning experiments. These are the two methods. Let me check the details. The first method is quenched H/D exchange with NMR. The material used is a-synuclein fibrils, both wild-type and A30P mutant. The readout is structural information about the fibrils, specifically the arrangement of beta-strands. The conclusion is that the A30P mutation doesn't change the number, location, or arrangement of beta-strands. However, some residues have nano-second dynamics. The readout type is probably quantitative since they're using NMR. The technical and biological replicates are not mentioned in the abstract, so they should be N.D. Similarly, controls like positive or negative aren't specified here. The statistical analysis isn't mentioned either. The Approved assay would be "Yes" if these methods are standard in the field for studying protein structure, but I need to infer that based on general knowledge.

Putting this all together, the variants section would have SNCA as the gene, the A30P mutation. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005317. The experimental methods would list the two NMR-based techniques, with details on materials and readouts, but most controls and replicates are N.D. since the abstract doesn't specify. The Approved assay might be "Yes" since these are common structural biology techniques.
