Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract detailed information from a scientific paper about PINK1 mutations and Parkinson's disease, then structure it into a specific JSON format. First, I need to read through the provided literature carefully.

The paper discusses heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene. The variants mentioned are in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain. However, the abstract doesn't provide specific HGVS nomenclature, which is required for the JSON. The user mentioned using an API to standardize HGVS, but since the paper doesn't give exact variant positions, I can't get precise HGVS codes. So, I'll have to note that as N.D.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's. MONDO:0005256 is the correct term. 

For the experimental methods, the paper describes creating stable cell lines with normal and mutant PINK1, subjecting them to oxidative stress, and measuring apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential. The methods include in vitro experiments with cell lines, but the specific assay names like Western Blot aren't mentioned. I'll have to list the methods as described, noting that details like statistical analysis aren't provided in the abstract, so I'll use N.D. for those fields.

The user also wants to know if the methods are generally used for studying Parkinson's. Since the experiment involves cell lines and apoptosis, which are common in Parkinson's research, I'll mark "Approved assay" as Yes.

I need to ensure all fields in the JSON are filled, using N.D. where information isn't present. Variants are mentioned but without specific HGVS codes, so the variants section will have N.D. for the HGVS and related fields. The disease section is straightforward with MONDO. Experimental methods will include the described assays, but without specific details on replicates or controls, those will be N.D. unless inferred from the text.

Finally, I'll structure all this into the JSON format as specified, making sure to follow the user's example and constraints.
