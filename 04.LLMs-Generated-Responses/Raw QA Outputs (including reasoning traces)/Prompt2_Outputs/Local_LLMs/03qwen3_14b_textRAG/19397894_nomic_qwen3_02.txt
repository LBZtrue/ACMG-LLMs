Okay, so I need to extract information from this scientific paper about LRRK2 mutations and their effect on kinase inhibitors. Let's start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, the title mentions the I2020T and G2019S mutants of LRRK2 and their altered kinase inhibitor sensitivity. The authors are from Invitrogen, and the article is about Parkinson's disease. The abstract says that these mutations affect ATP affinity and inhibitor sensitivity. The introduction talks about LRRK2 mutations being a cause of PD and the potential of inhibiting LRRK2 as a treatment. The specific mutations I2020T and G2019S are in the activation loop of the kinase domain. The results mention that G2019S has lower ATP affinity (2-fold), I2020T has higher (6-fold), and their sensitivity to inhibitors differs: I2020T is 10-fold more resistant, G2019S 1.6-fold more sensitive.

Now, the user wants a JSON structure. Let's break down each part.

Variants Include: The gene is LRRK2. The variants are I2020T and G2019S. Need to standardize HGVS nomenclature. The paper doesn't mention transcript IDs, so I might need to use the standard ones or note that it's not provided. The cDNA changes would be the positions and amino acid changes. For example, G2019S would be NM_001126112.3:c.6056G>A (assuming the transcript) and p.G2019S. Similarly for I2020T. But since the paper doesn't give transcript details, maybe use N.D. for the transcript? Wait, the user said to standardize via API, but if the paper doesn't have transcript info, that's a problem. However, the user also said to use N.D. if not mentioned. So for transcript, position, etc., use N.D. unless the paper provides it. The paper mentions positions as 2019 and 2020, so maybe those are the amino acid positions. The cDNA change would be the codon. For example, G2019S would be a change from G to A at the codon corresponding to position 2019. But without transcript info, I can't be sure. So perhaps the HGVS nomenclature is just the protein change, but that's not standard. Maybe the paper doesn't provide the cDNA details, so we have to use N.D. for those fields.

Described Disease: The disease is Parkinson's disease. Need the MONDO term. MONDO:0005313 is Parkinson's disease.

Experiment Method: The methods mentioned are binding assays or kinase assays? The abstract says they did binding assays to measure ATP affinity and inhibitor sensitivity. The results mention experiments with ATP and inhibitors. The paper doesn't give details on replicates, controls, etc. So for biological and technical replicates, need to check the text. The abstract doesn't mention replicates, so N.D. for those. Controls: the paper might not mention them, so N.D. for positive and negative controls. Statistical analysis method: not mentioned, so N.D. Thresholds: the results mention 2-fold, 6-fold, 10-fold, 1.6-fold. But the thresholds for normal and abnormal are not specified in the text, so need to use custom. Approved assay: the methods are standard for studying kinase inhibitors, so maybe Yes.

Putting it all together, the JSON will have the variants with N.D. for transcript info, disease with MONDO term, and experiment methods with N.D. for controls and replicates, but the readout descriptions will include the ATP affinity and inhibitor sensitivity results.
