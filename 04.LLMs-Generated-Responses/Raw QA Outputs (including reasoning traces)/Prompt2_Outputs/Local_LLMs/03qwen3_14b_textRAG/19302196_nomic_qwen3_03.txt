Okay, let me start by reading through the provided literature. The user is asking me to extract information about genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods from this text. 

First, looking at the variants. The text mentions the LRRK2 gene and the G2019S mutation. It says that G2019S is responsible for about 40% of familial PD cases in North African Arabs and up to 30% in Ashkenazi Jews. The variant is described as G2019S, which I need to convert into HGVS nomenclature. The gene is LRRK2, so the HGVS would be something like NM_001126113.1:c.6056G>A (assuming the transcript number for LRRK2). However, I need to check if the exact transcript is provided in the text. Wait, the text doesn't mention the transcript ID, so I might have to use a placeholder or note that it's not available. But the user wants standardization via API, so perhaps the API can resolve the transcript based on the gene and position. The position is 2019 in the gene, but I need to confirm the exact cDNA position. Wait, the mutation is G2019S, which refers to the amino acid position 2019. But HGVS uses the cDNA position, not the protein. Hmm, this is a common confusion. The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 is actually a substitution at codon 2019, which is the GAA codon for glutamic acid. The mutation changes it to AGA, which is arginine. So the cDNA change would be at position 6056 (since each codon is 3 nucleotides, 2019*3=6057, but maybe there's an offset). However, without the exact transcript, I can't be precise. The user might expect me to use the standard HGVS for this well-known mutation, which is NM_001126113.1:c.6056G>A. I'll proceed with that, noting that the transcript is assumed based on common knowledge.

Next, the disease. The text discusses Parkinson's disease (PD), so the MONDO term for PD is needed. MONDO:0005148 is the term for Parkinson's disease. I'll check that.

For the experimental methods, the text doesn't explicitly describe any experiments. It's a review or summary of existing studies, mentioning the prevalence of the mutation but not detailing any specific assays. Therefore, there might be no experimental methods to extract. However, the user's example includes a hypothetical scenario, so maybe the answer should reflect that no methods are present. But the user might expect that even if not explicitly mentioned, we should infer or note that. However, the instructions say to extract from the literature, so if there's no mention of experiments, then the Experiment Method section would be empty. But the user's example includes a method, so perhaps in this case, there are no methods mentioned. Therefore, the Experiment Method array would be empty.

Putting it all together: Variants Include has the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, the disease is Parkinson's with MONDO:0005148, and no experimental methods are described. However, the user's example included a method, so maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the text says "increased kinase activity" but doesn't describe an experiment. So no, there are no experiments detailed here. Therefore, the Experiment Method section would be empty. 

But the user might expect that even if the methods aren't detailed, we should include placeholders. However, according to the instructions, we need to extract what's present. Since there are no experiments described, the Experiment Method array should be empty. 

So the final answer would have the variant information, the disease, and an empty Experiment Method array.
