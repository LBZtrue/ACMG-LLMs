Okay, let me start by carefully reading the user's query and the provided literature. The user wants me to extract specific information about genetic variants, the disease associated with them, and the experimental methods used in the study. They also require the use of HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms, which I need to standardize via API and database lookups, respectively.

First, I need to identify the variants mentioned in the literature. The article mentions LRRK2 mutants Y1699C and G2019S. The wild-type LRRK2 is also discussed, but since the question is about variants, I should focus on the mutant alleles. The gene is LRRK2. Now, I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for these variants. However, the literature doesn't provide the transcript numbers or exact cDNA changes. The user's example includes transcript numbers, so I need to infer or look up the correct transcripts. For example, LRRK2's common transcript is NM_057173.3. The variants Y1699C and G2019S are typically in this transcript. But without explicit information in the text, I might need to note that the transcript isn't specified, but the user might expect standard ones. However, the user's instructions say to use what's explicitly stated. Since the literature doesn't mention the transcript, I should use N.D. for that. However, in the example, they used a transcript even if not explicitly mentioned. Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. Wait, the user's example includes a transcript, but in the actual literature, if it's not mentioned, should I leave it as N.D.?

Next, the disease. The abstract mentions that LRRK2 mutations cause parkinsonian symptoms indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. So the described disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. MONDO:0005303 is the term for Parkinson's disease. So that's the MONDO entry.

For the experimental methods, the study used HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells, exposed to H2O2 to induce oxidative stress, and measured the effect of LRRK2 variants on cell survival or ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The methods might include cell viability assays or Western blotting. The literature mentions "wild-type and mutant LRRK2 were expressed in HEK293 cells, and cell viability was assessed after H2O2 treatment." So the assay method is cell viability assay. The materials used are HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells. The readout type is quantitative, as they measured viability. The results mention that wild-type LRRK2 increased viability, while mutants decreased it. The biological and technical replicates aren't explicitly mentioned, so they should be N.D. unless the text states them. The controls would be wild-type and empty vector. The statistical analysis method isn't specified, so again N.D. The thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren't given, so I need to use standard thresholds. For example, cell viability below 70% could be considered abnormal, but since the user says to use literature if present, and it's not here, I should use custom. The approved assay would be whether this method is standard for Parkinson's. Since the study is about LRRK2 and cell viability, and Parkinson's research often uses cell models, it's likely approved.

Putting this all together, I need to structure the JSON with the variants, disease, and experiments as per the example. However, some fields might be N.D. if not explicitly mentioned in the text. I need to be careful not to infer beyond the given information.
