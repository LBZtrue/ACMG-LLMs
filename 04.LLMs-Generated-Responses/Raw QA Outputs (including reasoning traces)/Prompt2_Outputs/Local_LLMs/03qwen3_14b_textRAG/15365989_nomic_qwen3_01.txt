Okay, I need to extract information from the given research article and structure it into the specified JSON format. Let's start by reading the article carefully.

First, the article discusses a novel homozygous p.E64D mutation in the DJ1 gene associated with Early Onset Parkinson Disease (PARK7). The key points here are the gene (DJ1), the mutation (p.E64D), and the disease (PARK7). The variant's HGVS nomenclature is mentioned as c.192G>C. I should check if this is standardized. The user mentioned using an API for HGVS standardization, so I'll note that as a step, even though I can't access the API here. The cDNA change is from G to C at position 192 in the transcript. The protein change is from E to D at position 64.

Next, the disease. The article refers to Early Onset Parkinson Disease (EOPD), which is also known as PARK7. I need to find the MONDO term for this. I'll have to look up MONDO to find the correct ID. From previous knowledge, Parkinson disease, autosomal recessive, early onset is likely MONDO:0005322, but I should confirm. The article mentions PARK7, which is associated with DJ1 gene mutations. The MONDO term for PARK7 is probably MONDO:0005322.

Now, the experimental methods. The article describes several experiments. The first is using [18F]FP-CIT and PET to measure dopamine uptake transporter (DAT) binding in the striatum. This is a PET imaging method. The material used is patient-derived material, specifically a patient of Turkish ancestry and his sister. The readout is quantitative, showing reduced DAT binding. The conclusion is that there's a serious loss of presynaptic dopaminergic afferents.

Another method is overexpression of the E64D and L166P mutations in HEK293 and COS7 cells, followed by immunocytochemistry. The readout here is the localization of the mutant DJ1 protein. For E64D, 5% of cells showed nuclear localization, while 80% for L166P. The control would be wild-type. The article mentions that the structure of the protein is affected, leading to different localization. The statistical analysis isn't explicitly mentioned, but the threshold for normal would be standard localization, and abnormal would be altered localization. The approved assay for these methods is likely yes, as these are standard techniques in molecular biology.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format. Let's start with the variants. The gene is DJ1, the HGVS is c.192G>C, which needs standardization. The cDNA change is G to C at position 192. The protein change is E (Glu) to D (Asp) at position 64. The description in the article is "novel homozygous p.E64D mutation in the DJ1 gene".

For the disease, the described disease is Early Onset Parkinson Disease (EOPD), which is PARK7. The MONDO term would be MONDO:0005322.

Now, the experiments. The first is PET imaging with [18F]FP-CIT. The material used is patient-derived (patient and sister). Readout is quantitative, showing reduced DAT binding. The biological replicates aren't mentioned, but the sister is a related sample. Technical replicates might not be specified. Controls: the article mentions the sister as a control, but I need to check if that's a basic positive or negative control. The article says the sister is homozygous for the mutation, so maybe not a control. Alternatively, the wild-type could be a control. The article doesn't explicitly mention controls for this part. The statistical analysis method isn't detailed, so I'll put N.D. The threshold for normal and abnormal readout would be based on standard values for DAT binding in the striatum. The approved assay for PET imaging in Parkinson's is likely yes.

The second experiment is immunocytochemistry on HEK293 and COS7 cells overexpressing E64D and L166P. The material is cell lines. Readout is the localization of the protein. The basic positive control would be wild-type cells. The negative control might be empty vector. The article doesn't mention validation controls for pathogenic or benign variants, so those fields would be N.D. The statistical analysis method isn't specified. The threshold for normal would be standard protein localization in the cytoplasm, and abnormal would be nuclear localization. Approved assay is yes.

Putting all this together into the JSON structure, ensuring each part is correctly filled with the information from the article and standard terms where necessary.
