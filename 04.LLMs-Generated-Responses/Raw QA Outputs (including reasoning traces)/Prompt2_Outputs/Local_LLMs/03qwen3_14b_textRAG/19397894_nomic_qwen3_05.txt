Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from a scientific paper about LRRK2 mutations and their effects on kinase inhibitors. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with standardized HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms.

First, I need to read the provided literature text carefully. The mutations mentioned are I2020T and G2019S in the LRRK2 gene. The study discusses their effects on ATP affinity and kinase inhibitor sensitivity. 

For the variants, the gene is clearly LRRK2. The HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. However, the paper doesn't provide transcript numbers or exact cDNA positions. The user mentioned using APIs for standardization, but since the example didn't have that info, maybe I should use the variant names as described, even if they're not fully standardized. Wait, the user said to standardize via API, but if the literature doesn't have the transcript, how can that be done? Maybe the answer uses the information given, like the protein positions, and note that transcript info is missing. 

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's is MONDO:0005210. I'll need to confirm that from the MONDO database.

For the experimental methods, the paper mentions binding assays and enzymatic assays (in vitro kinase activity assay). The materials used are likely recombinant LRRK2 proteins with the mutations. The readouts are the ATP affinity changes and inhibitor sensitivity. The results describe the 2-fold lower and 6-fold higher ATP affinity for G2019S and I2020T, respectively. The inhibitor resistance/sensitivity at 1mM ATP. 

The user's JSON structure requires details on replicates, controls, etc. The literature doesn't mention biological or technical replicates, so those fields should be N.D. Similarly, controls like positive or negative might not be specified, so they would be N.D. The statistical methods aren't mentioned either. 

Approved assay would be N.D. unless there's a common method for studying kinase inhibitors in Parkinson's. But the paper doesn't state that, so it's N.D.

Putting it all together, the variants section will have the gene and the mutations, even without full HGVS. The MONDO term is correct. The experiments will have the methods described, with readout descriptions based on the paper's findings. All other fields without explicit info will be N.D.
