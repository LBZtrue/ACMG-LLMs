Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature to extract the necessary information. The user wants me to extract genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods in a structured JSON format. First, I need to identify the variants mentioned in the abstract and the sections of the paper.

The abstract mentions five mutations: L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A in the DJ-1 protein. These are all point mutations. The gene involved here is DJ-1, which is also referred to as PARK7 in the literature. The disease associated with these mutations is Parkinson's disease. I need to check the MONDO database for the correct term for Parkinson's disease.

Next, the experimental methods section. The paper uses solution state NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopies. I need to detail each method, including material sources, readout types, etc. However, the literature doesn't specify the exact materials used beyond the protein variants. The readout types here are structural perturbations and thermodynamic stability, which are qualitative and quantitative measures. The results compare the mutants to the wild-type protein, showing different degrees of destabilization.

For the variants, I need to standardize their HGVS nomenclature. The problem is that the literature doesn't provide transcript IDs or specific cDNA changes, only the protein changes. Since the HGVS standard requires transcript information, which isn't given here, I might have to use N.D. for the transcript details unless I can infer them from the gene's known transcripts. However, without API access, I can't look up the exact transcript IDs, so I'll have to use N.D. for that part.

Regarding the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease, I know that Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005017. I'll use that. For the experimental methods, the methods are NMR and circular dichroism. The readout descriptions would include the structural and thermodynamic effects observed. Since the literature doesn't mention replicates or controls explicitly, I'll mark those as N.D. unless I can infer them from the context. The approved assay part would need to determine if these methods are commonly used for studying Parkinson's disease. NMR and CD are standard in structural biology, so likely yes.

Putting this all together into the JSON structure as specified, making sure to handle missing data with N.D. where necessary, and using the correct MONDO term. Also, the molecular effects for each variant are described in the abstract, so I can map those to each variant's result description.
