Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from a scientific paper about a specific mutation in alpha-synuclein and structure it into a JSON format with standardized HGVS nomenclature and MONDO disease terms. 

First, I need to parse the provided literature text. The main points are the E46K mutation in alpha-synuclein, its effects on phospholipid binding and filament assembly, and the diseases involved, which are Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.

Starting with the variants. The paper mentions the E46K mutation. The gene is alpha-synuclein, which is commonly known as SNCA. The HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. However, the paper doesn't provide the transcript ID or the exact cDNA change. The mutation is E46K, which is a substitution from glutamic acid to lysine at position 46. So the protein change would be p.E46K. But without the transcript ID, I can't fully standardize the HGVS. Maybe the paper refers to a specific transcript, but since it's not mentioned, I'll note that as N.D. 

Next, the disease. The paper discusses Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Using MONDO, I need to find the correct terms. Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005319, and dementia with Lewy bodies is MONDO:0003873. 

For the experimental methods, the paper describes two main assays: phospholipid binding and filament assembly. For phospholipid binding, they compare the E46K mutation to wild-type, showing increased binding to negatively charged liposomes. For filament assembly, they note that E46K assembles filaments with a twisted morphology and 43 nm cross-over spacing, similar to A53T but different from A30P.

Each method needs details like material used (probably recombinant proteins), readout types (quantitative for binding, morphological for filaments), and whether replicates were done. The paper doesn't mention replicates, so those would be N.D. Controls might be the wild-type protein. Statistical analysis isn't specified, so that's also N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren't mentioned, so I'll use custom based on standard practices. Approved assays would be Yes for these methods as they are common in protein studies.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should include the variant with the available info, the MONDO terms, and the experimental methods with their details. Since some parts aren't specified in the paper, I'll mark them as N.D. or use custom thresholds where necessary.
