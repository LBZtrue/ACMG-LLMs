Okay, let's start by carefully reading the user's query and the provided context. The user wants me to extract specific information from the given scientific literature about somatic mutations in the PARK2 gene in glioblastoma and other malignancies. The output needs to be in a structured JSON format with specific fields for variants, disease, and experimental methods.

First, I need to identify the variants mentioned. The title mentions PARK2, but looking through the context, there's no specific variant listed. The authors and affiliations are there, but no mutations are detailed. The contributions section talks about experiments and data analysis, but again, no specific variants are provided. The abstract and main content aren't included here, so I have to rely solely on the given text.

Since the literature doesn't mention any specific variants, the "Variants Include" section will be empty. Next, the described disease is glioblastoma and other malignancies. I need to check the MONDO database for the correct terms. Glioblastoma is MONDO:0005338, and other malignancies might be broader terms, but the primary focus here is glioblastoma, so I'll use that MONDO ID.

For the experimental methods, the contributions mention experiments performed, data analysis, and reagents used. However, the exact methods like Western Blot or sequencing aren't specified. Therefore, the "Experiment Method" array will be empty as well. All fields not mentioned in the literature should be marked as N.D.

I need to ensure that all JSON fields are present even if they're empty or marked as N.D. The user emphasized using the MONDO database for disease terms and standardizing HGVS nomenclature, but since there are no variants here, that part remains unprocessed. Also, the "Approved assay" field should be N.D. because there's no information on whether the methods are standard for the disease.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure to follow the required format strictly without adding any fabricated information.
