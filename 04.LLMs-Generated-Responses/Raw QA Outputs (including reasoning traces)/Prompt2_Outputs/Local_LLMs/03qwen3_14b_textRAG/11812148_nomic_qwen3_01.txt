Okay, I need to process the provided scientific literature and extract the required information into a JSON format as specified. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify all the relevant parts.

First, the article discusses α-synuclein (α-Syn) and its variants. The variants mentioned are A30P and A53T, which are linked to familial Parkinson's disease. The study compares these mutants with wild-type α-Syn and a double mutant A53T/A30P. The main focus is on their membrane interaction properties.

For the "Variants Include" section, I need to extract the gene, HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. The gene here is SNCA, as α-synuclein is encoded by the SNCA gene. The variants are A30P and A53T. However, the text doesn't provide specific HGVS nomenclature, so I might need to infer based on standard conventions. For example, A30P would correspond to a change from Alanine to Proline at position 30, which in the SNCA gene would be p.A30P. The cDNA change would depend on the transcript, but since the exact transcript isn't given, I might have to use a placeholder like NM_000340.3 (a common transcript for SNCA) and note that the position might need to be determined via API. However, the user mentioned standardizing via API, so I should note that even if the exact HGVS isn't in the text, I need to use the API to get the correct nomenclature. But since the text doesn't provide the transcript, maybe I can't proceed accurately here. Wait, the text mentions "A30P mutant a-Syn" and "A53T substitution," so the protein changes are clear. However, the HGVS nomenclature requires the transcript and cDNA position. Since the literature doesn't provide this, I might have to use "N.D." for the transcript and position, but the user's example shows that even if the variant is mentioned without transcript, it's included. But the user's instructions say to standardize via API, so perhaps I need to look up the correct HGVS for A30P and A53T in SNCA. However, without the exact transcript, this might not be possible. Maybe the standard transcript is NM_000340.3, and the cDNA change would be at position 90 (since the protein is 140 amino acids, and the cDNA would be around that). But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the literature doesn't provide the transcript, the HGVS might not be available, so it's N.D. But the user's example shows that the variant is included even without detailed HGVS, so perhaps I should proceed with what's given and note that the HGVS needs to be standardized via API, which might not be possible here. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease, specifically familial. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005095. I need to confirm that, but assuming that's correct.

For the experimental methods, the study used techniques like vesicle binding assays, perhaps with lipid vesicles, and measured membrane interaction. The text mentions "vesicle binding assays" and "membrane binding assays" as methods. The materials used might be lipid vesicles, and the readout type is quantitative, as they measured the extent of binding. The biological and technical replicates aren't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I might need to put "N.D." for those. The controls: the text mentions that wild-type α-Syn was used as a control, so the basic positive control is yes. The negative control isn't mentioned, so that would be N.D. Statistical analysis methods might be ANOVA or t-tests, but the text doesn't specify, so again N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts: the text says that the A30P mutant showed defective membrane interaction, so the threshold might be based on the level of binding compared to wild-type. However, without specific numbers, I can't provide exact thresholds, so they would be N.D. or based on standard practices. The "Approved assay" would be whether these methods are generally used for studying Parkinson's disease. Since membrane interaction assays are common in studying α-synuclein's role in Parkinson's, I might say "Yes" for approved assay.

Putting this all together, the JSON structure would include the variants with their inferred HGVS, the disease with MONDO term, and the experimental methods with details as extracted from the text, noting where information isn't provided.
