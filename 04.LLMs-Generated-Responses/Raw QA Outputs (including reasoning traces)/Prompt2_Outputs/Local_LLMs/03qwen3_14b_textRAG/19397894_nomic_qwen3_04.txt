Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the given scientific paper and structure it into a specific JSON format. The paper discusses LRRK2 mutations I2020T and G2019S and their effects on kinase inhibitor sensitivity.

First, I need to identify the variants. The paper mentions I2020T and G2019S. These are in the LRRK2 gene. The HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. Since the paper doesn't provide transcript numbers, I might need to use an API to find the correct HGVS format. However, since the user hasn't provided access to an API, I'll have to use the information given. The variants are described as I2020T and G2019S, which are amino acid changes. The cDNA change would correspond to these positions, but without transcript details, I can only note the positions as per the paper.

Next, the disease is Parkinson’s disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson’s disease. MONDO:0005317 is the correct term for Parkinson's disease.

For the experimental methods, the paper describes binding assays and enzymatic assays. The binding assays measured ATP affinity differences between the mutants and wild-type LRRK2. The enzymatic assays tested kinase activity with ATP concentrations around 1 mM. The results showed that I2020T was more resistant to inhibitors, while G2019S was more sensitive. 

I need to detail each method. The binding assays: material used is likely recombinant LRRK2 proteins, but the paper doesn't specify the source. The readout is quantitative, comparing ATP affinity. The conclusion is that I2020T has higher ATP affinity and G2019S lower. The enzymatic assays: readout is kinase activity, showing resistance and sensitivity. The paper doesn't mention replicates, controls, or statistical methods, so those fields will be N.D. The approved assay is likely "Yes" because kinase inhibition assays are standard for such studies.

I need to make sure all fields are filled, even if the information isn't explicitly stated. For example, if the paper doesn't mention biological replicates, I put N.D. and the description as "Not mentioned in the literature."

Putting it all together into the JSON structure, ensuring that each part of the example is mirrored, even with the missing details. Also, checking that MONDO terms are correct and that the variants are accurately represented.
