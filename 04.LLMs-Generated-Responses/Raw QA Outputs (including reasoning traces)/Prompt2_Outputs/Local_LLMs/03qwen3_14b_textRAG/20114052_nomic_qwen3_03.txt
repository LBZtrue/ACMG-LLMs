Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature. The article is about the E46K mutant of α-synuclein and its interaction with gangliosides GM3 and GM1. The main focus is on how this mutation affects ion channel formation and how GM3 can correct it.

First, I need to extract the genetic variant information. The E46K mutation is mentioned in the text. The gene here is SNCA, which encodes α-synuclein. The variant is E46K, which corresponds to a substitution at position 46 from glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K). The HGVS nomenclature would be based on the transcript. However, the article doesn't specify the transcript version. Since the user requires standardization via API, I might need to use a default transcript or check if there's a standard one for SNCA. Typically, the most common transcript for SNCA is NM_000340.3, but I should verify that. The cDNA change would be at position 137 (since the codon for E46 is likely at position 137 in the transcript), changing from G to A (since E is GAG and K is AAG). So the HGVS would be NM_000340.3:c.137G>A. The protein change would be E46K.

Next, the disease associated with this variant is Parkinson's disease. I need to retrieve the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. Checking MONDO, the term is MONDO:0005148.

Now, for the experimental methods. The key methods mentioned are planar lipid bilayer experiments, Langmuir monolayer techniques, and possibly others like recombinant protein expression or lipid bilayer reconstitution. The main experiment is the formation of ion channels by α-synuclein variants in lipid bilayers, and the effect of GM3 and GM1 on this. The readout types are quantitative (conductance measurements, selectivity, voltage response, single-channel activity). The readout description should include the E46K variant and its interaction with GM3 and GM1.

The article mentions that the E46K mutant forms ion channels, and GM3 reduces this activity. The control experiments would include wild-type α-synuclein and possibly the use of GM1. The text doesn't explicitly mention biological or technical replicates, but in scientific papers, it's common to perform replicates unless stated otherwise. However, the user's example uses "N.D." if not mentioned. The article does mention that the mutant was tested with and without GM3, which could be considered as different conditions rather than replicates. The validation controls for pathogenic and benign variants are not explicitly mentioned here, so I should put N.D. for those.

Statistical analysis methods are not detailed in the text, so again, N.D. The thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts are not specified in the literature, but based on the context, the normal readout could be the presence of functional channels, and abnormal would be the absence or reduction when GM3 is present. However, without explicit thresholds in the text, I'll mark them as "Custom" based on standard practices.

Approved assay would be Yes if the method is commonly used in Parkinson's disease research, which I think is the case for ion channel studies using lipid bilayers.

Putting this all together into the JSON structure as per the example, making sure all fields are filled appropriately, using N.D. where information isn't present, and using the standard MONDO term for Parkinson's.
