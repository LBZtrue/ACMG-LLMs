Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract specific information from the given scientific literature about α-synuclein and Parkinson's disease. The main areas are variants, disease terms, and experimental methods.

First, I need to check the literature for any genetic variants mentioned. The text talks about a mutation related to Parkinson's disease but doesn't specify the exact variant. The authors mention single point mutations and gene duplication/triplication linked to early-onset familial PD. However, there's no specific HGVS nomenclature provided. Since the literature doesn't give exact variant details, I'll have to note that as N.D. for variants.

Next, the disease. The paper clearly discusses Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's. From my knowledge, the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005306. I'll use that.

For experimental methods, the literature mentions single-molecule FRET (smFRET) studies and other biophysical techniques like NMR, EPR, CD, fluorescence. The smFRET study is detailed, looking at the folding of α-synuclein when bound to membranes. However, the user's example includes methods like Western Blot, but the actual paper doesn't mention that. The methods here are smFRET and others like NMR, EPR, CD, fluorescence. I'll need to list each with their details.

Material used: The study uses small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) and lipid mimics. The description mentions "small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), and membrane and lipid mimics." So the material source is probably synthetic or cell-derived, but the exact source isn't specified. I'll note that as N.D. or use the description from the text.

Readout types: The smFRET method is a quantitative readout, as it measures FRET efficiency. Other methods like NMR, EPR, CD, fluorescence are also quantitative. The readout description should include the variants, but since variants aren't specified, this will be N.D.

Replicates: The text doesn't mention biological or technical replicates for the smFRET study. So I'll put N.D. for those.

Controls: The literature doesn't mention specific positive or negative controls for the smFRET experiments. Again, N.D.

Statistical analysis: The paper combines smFRET with other biophysical methods. It mentions that the smFRET study showed that the mutation affects the conformational changes. But no specific statistical methods like ANOVA are mentioned. So statistical analysis method is N.D.

Thresholds: The paper doesn't provide specific numerical thresholds for normal or abnormal readouts. So I'll have to use standard thresholds based on my knowledge, noting the source as Custom.

Approved assay: The smFRET is a well-established method for studying protein conformational changes, so it's likely approved. But I need to confirm if it's generally used for Parkinson's disease. Since the study is about α-synuclein and its role in PD, smFRET is relevant and approved.

Putting it all together, the variants section will have N.D. because no specific variant is given. The disease is Parkinson's with the correct MONDO term. The experimental methods include smFRET and others, with details filled where available and N.D. where not.
