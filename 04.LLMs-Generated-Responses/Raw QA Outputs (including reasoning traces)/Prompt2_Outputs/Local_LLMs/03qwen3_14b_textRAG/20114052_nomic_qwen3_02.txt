Okay, let's start by reading the provided literature. The user wants detailed information on genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods extracted in a specific JSON format. First, I need to identify the genetic variant mentioned. The article discusses the E46K mutation in α-synuclein. The gene here is SNCA, and the variant is E46K. 

Next, the disease associated with this variant is Parkinson's disease. I need to check the MONDO database for the correct term. Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005341. 

For the variants section, the E46K mutation is at position 46. The HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. The article doesn't provide the transcript ID, so I might need to infer it or note that it's missing. However, since the user mentioned using APIs, I should check if there's a standard transcript for SNCA. Commonly, the transcript might be NM_000340.3. The cDNA change would be from G to A at position 137 (since the protein position is 46, and the cDNA position might be calculated based on the transcript). The protein change is from Glutamic acid (E) to Lysine (K) at position 46.

Moving to the experimental methods. The study used planar lipid bilayers and Langmuir monolayers. The methods involved incubating α-syn proteins with phosphatidylcholine bilayers, testing the effect of GM3 and GM1 gangliosides. The readouts include channel conductance, selectivity, voltage response, and single-channel activity. The variants mentioned are E46K. 

For each experiment method, I need to detail the material used (like recombinant proteins, gangliosides), readout types (quantitative, as they measured conductance), and the results. The biological and technical replicates aren't explicitly mentioned, so I'll use N.D. Control settings include the use of wild-type α-syn and GM3/GM1. Statistical analysis methods aren't specified, so again N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts would be based on the observed effects, like the presence or absence of specific ion channel behavior. Approved assay would be Yes if the method is standard for studying ion channels, which I think it is.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format provided, making sure each section is filled with the correct information, using N.D. where details are missing. Also, ensure that HGVS is correctly standardized using the transcript ID if possible.
