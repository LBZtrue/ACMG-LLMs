Okay, let's start by carefully reading the user's query and the provided literature. The user wants me to extract information about genetic variants, the disease associated with them, and the experimental methods used in the study. They also require standardization of HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms.

First, I need to identify the gene and variants mentioned. The paper discusses DJ-1 mutations linked to Parkinson's disease. The specific variants listed are L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A. However, the literature doesn't provide the exact HGVS nomenclature, only the protein changes. So, I need to infer the cDNA changes based on the protein positions. But wait, without knowing the transcript, this might be tricky. The user mentioned using an API to standardize HGVS, but since the original text doesn't have the transcript ID, I might have to use N.D. for the transcript. However, the example in the user's prompt used a transcript, so maybe I need to look up the DJ-1 gene's transcript. Let me check: DJ-1 is also known as PARK7, and the gene is PARK7. The transcript NM_001126112.3 is for PARK7. So, assuming the same transcript, I can map the protein positions to the cDNA. But the paper doesn't specify the exact cDNA changes, only the amino acid changes. So, the HGVS would be like NM_001126112.3:c.497C>T for L166P (since L is Leucine at position 166, which would correspond to a specific codon). But without the exact cDNA positions, this is an assumption. However, the user might expect that the HGVS nomenclature is provided in the literature. Since it's not present, I have to use N.D. for the cDNA change and transcript. But the example in the user's prompt had the HGVS, so maybe the user expects that even if the literature doesn't have it, I should infer. However, without the exact mapping, that's not feasible. Therefore, I'll note that the HGVS is not provided in the literature and use N.D. for the transcript and cDNA changes.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. MONDO:0005303 is the term for Parkinson's disease. So that's straightforward.

For the experimental methods, the paper mentions using solution NMR and CD spectroscopy. The methods section states that the authors used solution NMR and CD spectroscopy to examine the structural changes in the mutant proteins. They also mention that they performed three biological replicates for each variant, but the original text doesn't explicitly state that. Wait, the abstract says "three biological replicates for each variant," but looking back, the abstract says "three biological replicates for each variant in the study." Wait, the user's example had "Three biological replicates were performed." But in the literature provided, the methods section might not mention replicates. Let me check again. The literature's methods section is not detailed here, only the abstract mentions "three biological replicates for each variant in the study." So, I can use that as the description for biological replicates. Technical replicates are not mentioned, so N.D. for that. Positive and negative controls: the paper might have used wild-type as a positive control and mutant as a negative, but the literature doesn't specify. So, those would be N.D. as well. Statistical analysis methods: the paper doesn't mention any specific statistical tests, so N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts: the paper talks about structural changes and stability, but doesn't provide specific thresholds. So, I'll have to use "standard for normal results based on own knowledge," which for NMR and CD might be based on typical values, but without specific data, I can't be precise. Approved assay: the methods used (NMR and CD) are standard in structural biology, so likely "Yes" for approved assay.

Putting it all together, the variants are listed with their protein changes, and since HGVS isn't provided, the cDNA changes are N.D. The MONDO term is MONDO:0005303. The experimental methods include NMR and CD, with biological replicates mentioned, but other controls and statistical methods not specified. Approved assay is "Yes" because these are standard techniques.
