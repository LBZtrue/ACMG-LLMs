Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided scientific literature about parkin mutations in Parkinson's disease and structure it into a JSON format with detailed data. 

First, I need to identify all the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract and the context mention that the study analyzed 22 parkin point mutants, but specific variants aren't listed by HGVS nomenclature. The paper refers to "many disease-linked point mutants of parkin retain substantial catalytic activity," but without specific mutations like R275H or G432E, which are known in literature. However, the user's example uses hypothetical variants, so I might have to use N.D. here since the actual variants aren't specified in the provided text.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's. MONDO:0005311 is the correct term. 

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions systematic analysis of parkin point mutants. The methods likely include techniques like Western blot, immunofluorescence, and detergent extraction assays. However, the provided text doesn't detail specific methods, their controls, replicates, or statistical analyses. So, I'll have to use N.D. for those fields unless there's an explicit mention.

I also need to check if the experimental methods are generally used for PD studies. Techniques like Western blot are standard, but without explicit confirmation from the text, I'll mark it as N.D.

Putting this all together, the JSON structure will have variants with N.D. since specific HGVSs aren't listed, the MONDO term for Parkinson's, and experimental methods with N.D. for most details. I need to ensure all fields are filled, using N.D. where information isn't present in the literature.
