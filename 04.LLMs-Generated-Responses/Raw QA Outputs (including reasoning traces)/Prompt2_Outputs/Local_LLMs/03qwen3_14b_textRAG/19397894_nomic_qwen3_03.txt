Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature carefully. The user wants me to extract genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods in a structured JSON format. First, I need to identify the variants mentioned. The article discusses two mutations in the LRRK2 gene: I2020T and G2019S. 

For the variants, I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. The article mentions these as I2020T and G2019S. However, the HGVS format requires the transcript ID and the specific nucleotide change. The problem is that the literature doesn't provide the exact transcript numbers. Since the user mentioned using APIs for standardization, I might need to look up the correct HGVS nomenclature for these variants. But since the example in the user's query used a specific transcript (NM_001126112.3), maybe the LRRK2 gene has a standard transcript. Let me recall that LRRK2 is commonly annotated with transcripts like NM_015836.3. However, without the exact transcript provided in the literature, I might have to note that the transcript is not specified and use "N.D." as per the constraints. Wait, the user said if not mentioned in the literature, use N.D. So if the transcript isn't given, I should use N.D. for the transcript field.

Next, the disease associated with these variants is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005241. I need to confirm that from the MONDO database. Let me check: yes, MONDO:0005241 is Parkinson's disease.

Now, the experimental methods. The article mentions two assays: binding assays and enzymatic (in vitro kinase activity) assays. 

For each method, I need to extract details. Let's take the binding assays first. The material used is not explicitly mentioned, but since it's a binding assay for ATP affinity, it might involve recombinant LRRK2 proteins. The literature says they did binding assays to measure ATP affinity, which would be a type of biochemical assay. The readout type is probably quantitative, as they measured binding affinity. The result descriptions would involve the specific findings about the variants' ATP affinity. The literature states that I2020T had a 2.5-fold increase in ATP affinity, and G2019S had a 1.5-fold increase. However, the exact method details (like whether they used a specific technique) aren't specified, so I'll have to note that as N.D. for some fields.

For the enzymatic assays, the in vitro kinase activity was measured. The results showed that I2020T had a 2-fold increase, and G2019S had a 1.5-fold increase in kinase activity. Again, the details about controls and replicates need to be checked. The literature doesn't mention biological or technical replicates, so those would be N.D. unless inferred. The positive control might be wild-type LRRK2, and the negative control could be a kinase-dead mutant or something similar, but the article doesn't specify, so those are N.D. as well.

Statistical analysis methods: the article mentions that the results are based on the assays, but it doesn't specify if they used ANOVA or other methods. So that's N.D. for statistical analysis. 

Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts: the literature doesn't provide specific thresholds, so I'll have to use the standard based on my knowledge. For example, in kinase assays, a significant increase in activity might be considered abnormal, but without specific thresholds in the text, I'll have to note that as custom.

Approved assay: the binding and in vitro kinase assays are standard in biochemical studies, so they are likely approved assays.

Putting all this together into the JSON structure, ensuring that each field is filled according to the literature or marked as N.D. where not mentioned. Also, making sure the MONDO term is correct and the variants are properly structured with the available information.
