Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They provided a scientific abstract about LRRK2 variants and Parkinson's disease and want the information structured into a specific JSON format. The user is asking for detailed extraction of genetic variants, disease terms, and experimental methods, with standardization using HGVS and MONDO.

First, I need to parse the abstract to find the gene, variants, and their descriptions. The variants mentioned are rs34778348:G4A (p.G2385R), rs33949390:G4C (p.R1628P), rs7133914:G4C (p.R1398H), and rs7308720:C4A (p.N551K). I need to convert these into HGVS format. Since the paper doesn't specify the transcript, I might need to use a standard one for LRRK2, like NM_181779.3, but I should note that the transcript isn't specified in the text. However, the user mentioned using an API for standardization, so maybe I can look up the correct transcript. But since the user hasn't provided an API, I'll proceed with the information given, using the rsID and protein changes, and note the transcript as N/A if not provided.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term. MONDO:0005066 is the correct term for Parkinson's disease.

For the experimental method, the abstract mentions that the variants were studied in dopaminergic neurons, and the readout was kinase activity. The conclusion was that p.G2385R and p.R1628P increased kinase activity, while p.R1398H and p.N551K had no effect. The method isn't explicitly named, but since it's about kinase activity, it might be a kinase assay. The abstract doesn't mention replicates, controls, or statistical methods, so those fields would be N.D. unless I can infer from the context. However, the user's example included fields like biological and technical replicates, so if the text doesn't mention them, I should put N.D. for those. Also, the approved assay would be N.D. unless it's a standard method, but without more info, it's safer to put N.D.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format provided. Make sure each variant is under "Variants Include" with their HGVS, cDNA, and protein changes. Then, under "Experiment Method", list the assay method as "Kinase Activity Assay", describe the material used (dopaminergic neurons), readout type as quantitative, and include the readout descriptions with each variant's effect. Since the text doesn't mention replicates or controls, those fields should be N.D. with descriptions as N.D. or not applicable. The statistical analysis method isn't mentioned, so again N.D. The thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren't specified, so I'll use the standard based on my knowledge, but the user said to use literature if available, otherwise custom. Since the literature doesn't mention thresholds, it's better to put N.D. or use a general standard. However, the example used literature, so maybe I should put N.D. if not specified.

Wait, the example had "Threshold for normal readout" with a description from the literature, but in this case, the literature doesn't mention specific thresholds. So I should leave them as N.D. unless I can infer. But the user's instructions say if not described in the literature, determine based on own knowledge. So maybe I can use a standard threshold for kinase activity, like a certain percentage increase or decrease. However, without specific info, it's safer to put N.D. and source as custom. But the user might expect me to use standard thresholds. This is a bit ambiguous. I'll proceed with N.D. for thresholds since the literature doesn't specify.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the variants, the disease with MONDO term, and the experiment method with the details as extracted. Make sure all required fields are included, even if they are N.D. or not applicable.
