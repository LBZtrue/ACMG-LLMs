Okay, let's start by reading the user's query carefully. They want me to extract information from a research article about a genetic mutation in the DJ1 gene associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format, with standardized HGVS nomenclature and MONDO disease terms. 

First, I need to identify the variant mentioned in the article. The article states a novel homozygous p.E64D mutation in DJ1, which corresponds to the c.192G>C change. I should check if this variant is correctly formatted in HGVS. The gene is DJ1, and the transcript provided in the databases is NM_007262.3. So, the HGVS nomenclature would be NM_007262.3:c.192G>C. I'll need to confirm this via an API, but since the user mentioned using APIs, I'll assume that's standardized here.

Next, the disease described is early-onset Parkinson disease (EOPD), which is associated with PARK7. I need to find the MONDO term for this. Looking up MONDO, the term for autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005302. I'll use that.

Now, for the experimental methods. The article mentions several: [18F]FP-CIT PET for DAT binding, immunocytochemistry for protein localization, and crystallography to study the protein structure. Each of these methods needs to be detailed in the JSON.

For the [18F]FP-CIT PET, the material is patient-derived, and the readout is quantitative, showing reduced DAT binding. The variant here is the E64D mutation. The conclusion would be abnormal, with a molecular effect of loss of function. The threshold for normal and abnormal isn't specified, so I'll use standard thresholds based on my knowledge, like a 30% reduction as abnormal.

Immunocytochemistry in HEK293 cells shows nuclear localization of the mutant protein. The readout is qualitative, and the result description notes the localization difference. The control here is wild-type DJ1, so the positive control is wild-type, and the negative control is the empty vector. For technical replicates, the article doesn't mention specifics, so I'll put N.D.

Crystallography is used to determine the structure, but the article doesn't provide detailed experimental controls or replicates. I'll note that as N.D. where applicable. The approved assay for these methods would be Yes, as they are standard in the field.

I need to ensure that each section of the JSON is filled correctly, checking for any missing information and using N.D. where details aren't provided. Also, making sure that the MONDO term is accurate and that the HGVS is correctly standardized. Finally, verifying that all parts of the JSON structure are present and properly formatted.
