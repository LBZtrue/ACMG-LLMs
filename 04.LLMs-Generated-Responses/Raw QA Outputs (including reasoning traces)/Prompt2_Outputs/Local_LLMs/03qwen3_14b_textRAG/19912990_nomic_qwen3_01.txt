Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided scientific literature and structure it into a specific JSON format. They mentioned using HGVS nomenclature via an API and retrieving MONDO terms. First, I need to parse the literature thoroughly.

Looking at the abstract, the key variant is I2020T in the LRRK2 gene. The disease associated is Parkinson's disease. I need to confirm the gene name and variant details. The variant is in the kinase domain, and the article mentions the Sagamihara family, which is linked to PARK8. 

Next, for the MONDO term, Parkinson's disease is a well-known condition. The MONDO ID for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005177. I'll need to verify that through the database.

For the variants section, the article states the I2020T mutation. The HGVS nomenclature requires the transcript ID. The article doesn't specify the transcript, so I might need to infer it. However, since the user says to use N.D. if not mentioned, I should leave it as is unless I can find the transcript from another source. But the user's example shows that the transcript is included even if not explicitly stated, but in this case, the literature doesn't provide it. Hmm, maybe the user expects N.D. here. Let me check the original text again. The abstract mentions the I2020T mutation in the kinase domain but doesn't give the transcript number. So, I'll use N.D. for the transcript.

Now, the experimental methods. The study used proteolysis inhibitors to allow the protein level to recover, which suggests Western blotting or similar methods to measure protein levels. The results show that when proteolysis inhibitors were used, the protective effect increased. Also, they knocked down WT LRRK2 and observed reduced protectivity. This implies they used siRNA or shRNA for knockdown, and possibly Western blot for measuring protein levels and apoptosis assays like flow cytometry or TUNEL for apoptosis detection.

For each method, I need to note the assay type, materials used (like cell lines, maybe HEK293 or similar), biological and technical replicates. The article mentions "three biological replicates" as an example, but does the original text specify that? Let me check again. The abstract says "three biological replicates were performed" in the example, but the actual article here doesn't mention replicates. Wait, the original text provided by the user doesn't have details on replicates, controls, etc. So I need to use N.D. for those unless they can be inferred. However, the example given by the user includes details even if not explicitly mentioned, but maybe the user wants to extract only what's in the text.

Wait, the user's example included details like "Three biological replicates were performed" even if not in the text, but that might be an example. However, in the actual literature provided, the user's text doesn't mention replicates. So I should use N.D. for those fields. Similarly, the statistical analysis method isn't mentioned, so N.D. there as well.

The approved assay field: are the methods generally used for Parkinson's disease? Western blot and siRNA knockdown are standard techniques, so "Yes" for approved assay.

Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts: the article doesn't specify numerical thresholds, so I'll have to use standard thresholds based on knowledge. For example, protein expression above a certain level is normal, below is abnormal. But since the user says to use "Literature" if mentioned, else "Custom", I'll use "Custom" here.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the variant details with N.D. where necessary, MONDO term for Parkinson's, and the experiment methods with details as per the text, using N.D. for missing info and "Custom" for thresholds.
