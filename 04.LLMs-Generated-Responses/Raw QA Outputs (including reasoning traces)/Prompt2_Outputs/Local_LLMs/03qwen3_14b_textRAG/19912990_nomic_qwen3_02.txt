Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from a scientific paper about a specific mutation in the LRRK2 gene related to Parkinson's disease. The output needs to be in a structured JSON format with specific fields for variants, disease terms, and experimental methods.

First, I need to identify the genetic variant mentioned. The paper talks about the I2020T mutation in LRRK2. I should note the gene name, which is LRRK2. The variant is I2020T, so I need to convert that into HGVS nomenclature. The paper mentions it's in the kinase domain, but I need to check the transcript. Since the user wants standardization via API, I'll have to look up the correct transcript. However, the paper doesn't specify the transcript, so I might have to use a common one like NM_181797.3. The cDNA change would be from isoleucine to threonine at position 2020, so the HGVS would be NM_181797.3:c.6058A>T. The protein change would be p.I2020T.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term. MONDO:0005258 is the term for Parkinson's disease. 

For the experimental methods, the paper describes using proteolysis inhibitors to prevent degradation of the mutant LRRK2. They tested the protective effect against apoptosis using hydrogen peroxide. The methods mentioned are probably Western blot or similar techniques to measure protein levels and assess apoptosis. The materials used are likely cell lines, as the study involves treating cells with inhibitors and measuring apoptosis. 

The readout types would be quantitative, measuring protein levels and apoptosis rates. The results show that when proteolysis inhibitors were used, the protective effect increased. The control experiments would include wild-type LRRK2 as a positive control and maybe a negative control without the inhibitor. The statistical analysis might be ANOVA or t-tests. 

I need to check if the paper mentions biological or technical replicates. The text says "three biological replicates" and "each sample run in triplicate" if those details are present. The approved assay would be yes if Western blot is commonly used for studying LRRK2 in Parkinson's. 

Putting this all together into the JSON structure, making sure each field is filled correctly. I have to be careful with the HGVS standardization and ensure the MONDO term is accurate. Also, the experimental methods section needs to capture all the details from the paper, even if some information is inferred where not explicitly stated.
