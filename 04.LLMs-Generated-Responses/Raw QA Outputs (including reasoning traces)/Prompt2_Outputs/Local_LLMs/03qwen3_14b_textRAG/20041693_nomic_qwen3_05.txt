Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature excerpt carefully. The user wants me to extract information about genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods, then structure it into a specific JSON format. 

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract mentions three familial variants of R-synuclein: A30P, E46K, and A53T. These are associated with Parkinson's disease. The gene here is SNCA, as R-synuclein is also known as α-synuclein. I should check if the HGVS nomenclature is provided in the text. However, the literature doesn't specify the exact transcript or nucleotide changes, just the protein changes. Since the user requires standardizing HGVS via API, but the text doesn't have the necessary details, I'll have to use "N.D." for those fields.

Next, the disease. The text discusses Parkinson's disease, both familial and sporadic. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. From my knowledge, the MONDO ID is MONDO:0005256. I can confirm this later if needed.

For the experimental methods, the study used solution NMR spectroscopy to analyze phospholipid binding properties of the variants. The abstract mentions that they viewed the variants by solution NMR in a residue-specific manner. The method's description includes comparing binding affinities and NMR results showing different binding modes. However, the literature doesn't mention material sources, replicates, controls, or statistical methods. All these details are not present, so I'll put "N.D." where necessary.

The "Readout description" needs to include all variants. Since the variants are A30P, E46K, A53T, each with their effects on lipid affinity. The conclusion for each variant would be based on the study's findings: A30P has decreased affinity, E46K increased, and A53T comparable to wild-type. The molecular effects would be inferred from these changes, though the exact terms might need to be generalized, like "altered lipid binding affinity."

Approved assay: The NMR method is a standard technique for studying protein-lipid interactions, so it's likely approved for Parkinson's disease research. However, without explicit confirmation in the text, I might have to use "N.D." but given the context, "Yes" seems reasonable.

Putting it all together, I need to structure the JSON with variants, disease, and experiments. Each section will have the necessary fields filled with the extracted information, using "N.D." where details are missing.
