Okay, I need to extract information from the given literature about genetic variants, the diseases they're associated with, and the experimental methods used. Let's start by reading through the abstract and introduction carefully.

First, the article mentions familial Parkinson's disease mutations affecting α-synuclein assembly. The mutations discussed are E46K, A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T. The gene involved is α-synuclein, which is also referred to as αS. The diseases associated here are Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, which are part of Lewy body diseases (LBD). 

For the variants, the HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. The paper doesn't provide specific transcript numbers or cDNA changes, so I might have to note that as N.D. unless I can infer them. But the user mentioned using APIs for standardization, so I should indicate that even if the exact HGVS isn't given, I should still attempt to use the API, but if not possible, mark as N.D.

The disease terms need to be retrieved from MONDO. Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005065, and dementia with Lewy bodies is MONDO:0012114. I'll check MONDO to confirm these terms.

Next, the experimental methods. The article lists thioflavin S assay, circular dichroism spectroscopy, photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. For each method, I need to extract details like material used (probably α-synuclein variants), readout types (quantitative or qualitative), result descriptions (how each variant affected the process), replicates, controls, statistical methods, and whether the assay is approved for the disease.

The abstract mentions that E46K and A53T caused faster aggregation, while A30P had slower. The results are described in terms of molecular effects like increased or decreased aggregation rates. However, the exact readouts and thresholds aren't specified, so I'll have to use the information from the text and note that some details are inferred or not provided.

For the "Approved assay" part, I need to determine if these methods are generally used for studying Parkinson's disease. Thioflavin S and electron microscopy are commonly used in amyloid studies, so likely yes. Circular dichroism for structural analysis is also standard. I'll check if these are standard methods in the field.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have the variants with gene names, the disease with MONDO terms, and each experiment method with all the required fields. Where information is missing, I'll use N.D. and note the source as Literature or Custom where applicable.
