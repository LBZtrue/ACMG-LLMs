Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract information from the provided literature about genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods, and structure it into JSON format with specific details. First, I need to identify the variant mentioned. The paper talks about the E46K mutation in α-synuclein. The gene is SNCA, right? So the gene name is SNCA. The variant is E46K, which is a substitution of glutamic acid to lysine at position 46. Now, I need to convert that into HGVS nomenclature. The standard format is transcript ID followed by the cDNA change. However, the paper doesn't provide the transcript ID, so I might need to use an API to standardize it. But since I can't access external APIs here, I'll note that the HGVS nomenclature is not provided in the paper and use "N.D." as per the instructions.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005190. I need to confirm that from the MONDO database, but again, without access, I'll use that term as it's commonly known.

For the experimental methods, the paper mentions planar lipid bilayer experiments, Langmuir monolayer, and possibly others. The main method is the planar lipid bilayer technique used to study ion channel formation. The materials used are recombinant α-synuclein proteins, GM3 and GM1 gangliosides, and phosphatidylcholine bilayers. The readout types are quantitative, measuring ion channel conductance, selectivity, and response to voltage. The variants involved are the E46K mutant and wild-type. The results show that E46K forms less conductive channels compared to wild-type, and GM3 corrects this. The experimental replicates and controls aren't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll use "N.D." for those fields. The statistical analysis isn't detailed, so again "N.D." The approved assay for studying Parkinson's disease using this method would be "Yes" since ion channel studies are relevant.

Putting it all together in the JSON structure as per the example, making sure each field is filled with information from the paper or marked as N.D. where not available.
