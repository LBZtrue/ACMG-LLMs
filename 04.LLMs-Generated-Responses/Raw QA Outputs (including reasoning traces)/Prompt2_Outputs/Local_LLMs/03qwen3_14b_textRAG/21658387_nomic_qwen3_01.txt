Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract specific information from the given scientific literature about LRRK2 and Akt1. They need the data in a structured JSON format with standardized HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms.

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract mentions R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T. These are all mutations in the LRRK2 gene. But the problem is, the literature doesn't provide the exact transcript or cDNA changes. So I can't standardize the HGVS nomenclature without that info. The user mentioned using an API for standardization, but without the transcript details, I can't proceed. So I'll have to note that as N.D. for the HGVS and cDNA parts.

Next, the disease. The paper discusses Parkinson's disease, which is associated with the LRRK2 gene. I need to find the MONDO term. From what I know, Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005188. I'll check that against the MONDO database to confirm.

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions in vitro kinase assays and knockdown experiments. The kinase assay is used to show that LRRK2 phosphorylates Akt1 at Ser473. The knockdown experiment is done using intact cells. The methods section isn't detailed here, so I'll have to infer from the abstract. The readout type would be quantitative since they're measuring phosphorylation levels. The variants R1441C, G2019S, I2020T are the ones tested, but again, without transcript info, I can't get the HGVS details. The conclusion is that these variants have reduced interaction and phosphorylation of Akt1, which is a molecular effect of partial loss-of-function.

I need to make sure all fields in the JSON are filled, using N.D. where necessary. The "Approved assay" part would be "Yes" for kinase assays as they're commonly used in studying kinase activities and their effects on substrates like Akt1 in Parkinson's disease.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the variants with N.D. for missing details, the MONDO term for Parkinson's, and the experimental methods with the available information. I'll double-check each section to ensure compliance with the user's structure and requirements.
