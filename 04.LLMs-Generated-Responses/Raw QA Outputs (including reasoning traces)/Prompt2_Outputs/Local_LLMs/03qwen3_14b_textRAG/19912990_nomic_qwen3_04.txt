Okay, let me start by reading through the provided literature to extract the necessary information. The article is about the I2020T mutation in LRRK2 and its role in Parkinson's disease. 

First, I need to identify the genetic variant. The mutation mentioned is I2020T in the LRRK2 gene. I should check the HGVS nomenclature for this variant. The user mentioned using an API for standardization, but since I can't access external APIs here, I'll use the information from the text. The variant is described as I2020T, which corresponds to a change from isoleucine to threonine at position 2020. The gene is LRRK2, and the transcript number isn't specified in the text, so I'll note that as N.D.

Next, the disease associated with this variant is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. From my knowledge, the MONDO ID for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005172. I'll verify that later, but for now, I'll use that.

Now, looking at the experimental methods. The study used proteolysis inhibitors to prevent degradation of the I2020T mutant LRRK2. They compared the protective effects against apoptosis between the mutant and wild-type LRRK2. The methods involved using cells (probably HEK293 or similar, but the text doesn't specify the exact cell line), and they measured apoptosis. The readouts would be quantitative, as they measured the protective effect. They used controls like wild-type LRRK2 and possibly knockdown experiments. The statistical analysis isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll put N.D. for that. 

For the experimental methods section, I need to detail each assay. The main method here is the apoptosis assay, possibly using cell viability or caspase activity. The material used might be cell lines, but the exact name isn't given. The readout description should include the variant's effect, which the text states that I2020T has reduced protective effect compared to wild-type. The biological replicates aren't mentioned, so I'll put N.D. for that. Similarly, technical replicates and controls might not be specified, so I'll note N.D. where necessary. 

Approved assay for studying Parkinson's disease would be Yes, as apoptosis assays are commonly used in neurodegenerative disease research. 

I need to make sure all sections of the JSON are filled out accurately, using the information from the text and standard knowledge where the text is vague. Also, check that MONDO terms are correctly applied and HGVS is properly formatted even if transcript numbers are missing.
