Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature. The main focus is on the neuroprotective role of α-synuclein (a-Syn) and how its familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) mutations (A30P, A53T, and E46K) abolish this protection under rotenone and maneb treatments. 

First, I need to extract the genetic variants. The article mentions three missense mutations: A30P, A53T, and E46K. These are in the a-Syn gene. However, the literature doesn't provide the exact HGVS nomenclature, transcript numbers, or specific cDNA changes. The standardization via API is required, but since the user hasn't provided that, I'll have to use the information given and note that the HGVS nomenclature is not detailed in the text. 

Next, the disease associated with these variants is Parkinson’s disease (PD). I need to look up the MONDO term for PD. From my knowledge, the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005226. 

Now, the experimental methods. The study used SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant a-Syn, exposed to acute or chronic rotenone and maneb. The methods section mentions cell culture, plasmids, and transfection. The readout would be the neuroprotection effect, which was abolished by the mutations. The materials used are SH-SY5Y cells, which are a human neuroblastoma cell line. The readout type is likely qualitative or quantitative based on cell viability or neuronal death. 

The readout description should include all variants mentioned. Since the variants are A30P, A53T, E46K, each with their effect on neuroprotection. The molecular effect here is that the mutations abolish the neuroprotective role of a-Syn. 

For biological and technical replicates, the text doesn't explicitly mention them, so I should note N.D. (not described). Controls: the basic positive control would be wild-type cells, and the negative control might be empty vector or non-transfected cells. However, the text doesn't specify, so again, N.D. 

Statistical analysis isn't mentioned, so the method would be N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts: the study shows that the presence of the mutations leads to loss of neuroprotection. If the control (wild-type) shows protection, then the mutant would be abnormal. But since the exact thresholds aren't provided, I'll have to set them based on the conclusion that the mutant variants result in abnormal outcomes. 

Approved assay: The method used (cell culture with overexpression and exposure to toxins) is a common approach in studying neurodegenerative diseases, so likely "Yes" for approved assay. 

Putting it all together, I need to structure the JSON with the variants, MONDO term, and experiment details as per the user's framework.
