Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided scientific literature and structure it into a specific JSON format. The main areas are variants, disease, and experimental methods.

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned in the text. The article talks about LRRK2 mutations causing Parkinson's disease. The specific variants listed are G2019S, R1941H, I2012T, I2020T, G2385R, R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C, and T2356I. However, the text doesn't provide the exact HGVS nomenclature, which requires transcript IDs and positions. Since the user mentioned using an API to standardize HGVS, I should note that without the transcript details, I can't generate the standard HGVS format. But the user might expect placeholders or mention that the info isn't available.

Next, the disease described is Parkinson's disease. I need to find the corresponding MONDO term. I recall that Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005311. I'll check that to confirm.

For the experimental methods, the paper mentions a KESTREL screen using rat brain extracts to identify phosphorylated proteins by LRRK2 mutants. They also did kinase activity assessments. The readouts include phosphorylation of moesin, ezrin, radixin, and a peptide. The variants' effects on kinase activity are described: G2019S stimulated activity, others inhibited or had no effect. The methods don't mention replicates, controls, or statistical analysis explicitly. So I'll mark those as N.D. unless I can infer from the context. The KESTREL screen might be a specific assay method, but I need to confirm if it's a standard term. Also, the approved assay for studying Parkinson's would need to be determined. Since the methods are related to kinase activity and phosphorylation, which are common in molecular studies, I might say "Yes" for approved assay, but I'm not certain. Need to check if KESTREL is a recognized method.

Putting it all together: variants without HGVS details, MONDO term for Parkinson's, experimental methods with limited controls and replicates, and determining if the methods are standard. Also, the readout descriptions need to link each variant to their effect on kinase activity. Since the user provided an example, I'll follow that structure, making sure to use N.D. where information isn't present.
