Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature. The main focus is on LRRK2 variants and their effects on cell death via the ERK pathway. The user wants me to extract variants, diseases, and experimental methods in a specific JSON format.

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract and introduction mention Y1699C and G2019S mutants. Also, R1441C is mentioned in the introduction. I'll need to standardize these using HGVS nomenclature. However, the literature doesn't provide transcript IDs, so I might have to use the gene name and variant positions as given, but the user requires HGVS with transcript numbers. Since the API isn't available here, I'll note that the HGVS standardization is pending and use the information provided, even if incomplete.

Next, the disease. The paper discusses Parkinson's disease, so I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's. MONDO:0005316 is the correct term for Parkinson's disease.

For experimental methods, the study used HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells exposed to H2O2. The methods likely include cell viability assays, possibly measuring stress tolerance through ERK pathway activation. The readout type might be quantitative, assessing cell survival or ERK activation levels. The results show that wild-type LRRK2 increases stress tolerance, while mutants don't. The controls would be wild-type vs. mutants, and maybe empty vectors. The user wants details on replicates, controls, statistical methods, and whether the assays are approved for Parkinson's research.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format, making sure to use "N.D." where information isn't present. Since the literature doesn't specify transcript IDs for variants, I'll have to leave those fields as N.D. or use the gene and position as described. Also, the experimental methods section needs to include all the details mentioned, even if some parts like statistical analysis aren't explicitly stated.
