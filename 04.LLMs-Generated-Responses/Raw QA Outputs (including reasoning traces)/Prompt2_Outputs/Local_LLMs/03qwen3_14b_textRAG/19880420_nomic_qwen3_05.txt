Okay, I need to extract information from the provided literature and structure it into the specified JSON format. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

First, the article discusses Parkinson's disease (PD) and the role of PINK1 and parkin. The introduction mentions that mutations in PINK1 and parkin cause autosomal recessive PD, but the exact mechanisms are unclear. The main finding is that PINK1 phosphorylates parkin, activating its E3 ligase function and NF-κB signaling. The study also notes that PD-linked mutations in PINK1 impair this process.

Now, looking for genetic variants. The text mentions "PD-linked pathogenic PINK1 mutations" but doesn't specify exact variants. It also refers to "homozygous mutations in parkin" and "homozygous mutations in PINK1" as causes of early-onset PD. However, no specific HGVS nomenclature is provided. Since the user requires standardization via API, but the literature doesn't give specific variants, I'll have to note that as N.D.

Next, the disease. The study is about Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for PD. MONDO:0005301 is the correct term for Parkinson's disease.

For experimental methods, the abstract and introduction don't detail specific assays. The methods section isn't present in the provided text. The results might mention techniques like Western blot, but the given text doesn't specify. Since the user wants all methods mentioned, and the provided text doesn't include them, I'll list them as N.D.

The "Variants Include" section will have genes parkin and PINK1, but without specific variants, the entries will be N.D. The disease is Parkinson's, with the MONDO term. The experiment methods are not detailed, so all fields will be N.D. The "Approved assay" will also be N.D. as there's no information on whether the methods are generally used for PD studies.

I need to ensure all fields in the JSON are filled, using N.D. where information isn't present. The key is to be accurate and not infer any details not explicitly stated in the literature.
