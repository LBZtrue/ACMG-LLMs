Okay, let me start by reading through the provided literature to extract the necessary information. The user wants me to focus on genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods, then structure that into JSON with specific fields.

First, the variants. The abstract mentions the A53T and S87N substitutions in human-mouse α-synuclein chimeras. The gene here is SNCA, which encodes α-synuclein. I need to get the HGVS nomenclature for these variants. Since the literature doesn't provide transcript numbers, I might need to use an API to standardize them, but the example shows that if it's not present, I should use N.D. However, the user's instructions say to standardize via API. Wait, but the paper doesn't mention transcript IDs. Maybe I can infer that the variants are in the SNCA gene, but without the transcript, the HGVS can't be fully determined. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The example uses a transcript, but the literature here doesn't specify. So perhaps I should note that the transcript information is missing and use N.D. for the transcript field.

Next, the disease. The abstract mentions Parkinson’s disease (PD) and transgenic mice. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. Looking up MONDO, the term is MONDO:0005147. So that's the MONDO code.

For the experimental methods, the literature mentions fluorescence analysis and NMR chemical shift analysis. Let's break them down.

Fluorescence analysis: The method is Fluorescence. The material used is human-mouse chimeras. The readout type is quantitative, as they measure lag times and growth rates. The readout description should include the variants A53T and S87N. The conclusion for A53T is that it dominates growth kinetics, and S87N affects the lag phase. Molecular effect for A53T might be related to increased aggregation rates, but the literature doesn't specify loss-of-function or gain-of-function. So I'll put N.D. here. The result description would be as per the abstract.

NMR chemical shift analysis: This method is used to determine secondary structure propensities. The material is monomeric forms of the variants. Readout type is quantitative. The result description links conformational changes to growth rates. Again, the molecular effect is N.D. as the paper doesn't specify.

Replicates: The literature doesn't mention biological or technical replicates, so those fields are N.D. Controls: The paper doesn't mention positive or negative controls for these methods. Validation controls also aren't mentioned. Statistical analysis methods are not specified, so N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren't provided in the literature, so I'll have to use "N.D." for those. Approved assay: Since fluorescence and NMR are common methods for studying protein aggregation, I can put "Yes" for approved assay.

Putting this all together into the JSON structure as per the example. Making sure to use the correct MONDO term and handle missing information with N.D. where appropriate.
