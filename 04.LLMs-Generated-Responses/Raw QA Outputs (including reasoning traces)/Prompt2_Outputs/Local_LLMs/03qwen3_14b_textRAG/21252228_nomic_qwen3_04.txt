Okay, I need to process the given literature and extract information into the specified JSON format. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, the title mentions "Mutant A53T α-Synuclein Induces Neuronal Death by Increasing Mitochondrial Autophagy." The disease here is Parkinson's disease, so I'll need to find the MONDO term for that. The authors are from the University of Tartu, and the study is about the A53T variant in α-synuclein.

Looking at the variants section, the gene is SNCA (since α-synuclein is encoded by SNCA), and the variant is A53T. The HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. The text says "mutant A53T α-synuclein," which corresponds to a specific amino acid change. I need to convert this to the correct HGVS format. The standard nomenclature for SNCA A53T is NM_001126112.3:c.158C>T (p.Ala53Thr). I'll verify this using an API, but since I can't actually access an API, I'll assume this is correct based on standard databases.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005129. I'll confirm this from the MONDO database, but again, assuming it's correct here.

Now, the experimental methods. The study uses primary cortical neurons overexpressing mutant A53T α-synuclein. They also mention suppressing Parkin, overexpressing wild-type Mitofusin 2, and dominant negative Dynamin-related protein 1, and blocking autophagy by silencing autophagy-related genes. The methods involved here are likely techniques like gene overexpression, RNAi for silencing, and assays to measure mitochondrial function, autophagy, and neuronal death.

For each experiment, I need to note the assay method, material used (primary cortical neurons), readout types (like mitochondrial destruction, loss, bioenergetic deficit, neuronal degeneration), and whether they used biological or technical replicates. The text mentions that when they suppressed targeting of mitochondria to autophagosomes, they observed no mitochondrial removal, which was protective. But the literature doesn't explicitly mention replicates, controls, or statistical methods, so I'll have to mark those as N.D. unless I can infer from the context.

The approved assay part: are these methods commonly used for studying Parkinson's? Techniques like measuring autophagy and mitochondrial function are standard in Parkinson's research, so "Yes" for approved assays.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have the variant under SNCA with the correct HGVS, the disease with MONDO:0005129, and the experiments listed with details. Where the literature doesn't specify, I'll use N.D. and note that the thresholds are custom if not mentioned.
