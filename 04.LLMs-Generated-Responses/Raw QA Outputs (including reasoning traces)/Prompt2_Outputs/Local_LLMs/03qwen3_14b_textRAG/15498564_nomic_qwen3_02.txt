Okay, let's start by reading the provided literature. The abstract mentions the E46K mutation in alpha-synuclein increasing phospholipid binding and filament assembly. The diseases associated are Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The methods discussed are phospholipid binding assays and filament assembly analysis. 

First, I need to extract the variant information. The gene is SNCA, and the mutation is E46K. The HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized. Since the paper doesn't provide the exact transcript, I'll have to infer or note that it's not available. The cDNA change would be from GAG to AAG at position 137 (assuming the codon for E is GAG and K is AAG). Protein change is E to K at position 46.

Next, the disease. The literature talks about Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. I need to check MONDO for the correct terms. Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005311, and dementia with Lewy bodies is MONDO:0010959.

For the experimental methods, the paper mentions phospholipid binding and filament assembly. The materials used are likely recombinant alpha-synuclein proteins. The readout types are quantitative for phospholipid binding and qualitative for filament morphology. The results show increased binding and twisted filaments with 43 nm spacing. There's no mention of replicates, controls, or statistical methods, so those fields will be N.D. The assays are generally used for studying these diseases, so "Approved assay" would be Yes.

I need to structure this into the JSON format as specified, ensuring all fields are filled with N.D. where information isn't present. Also, check for any other variants mentioned, but the paper only discusses E46K.
