Alright, I'm going to tackle this query step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They've provided a context which is an abstract about Parkinson's disease and some experimental methods used in the study.

The main task here is to extract specific information from this abstract and structure it into a JSON format following strict guidelines. Let me break down the requirements:

1. **Variants Include**: I need to identify any genetic variants mentioned, standardize their HGVS nomenclature using an API, and provide details like cDNA changes and protein changes.

2. **Described Disease**: Extract the disease studied (Parkinson disease) and find its corresponding MONDO term from the database.

3. **Experiment Method**: List all experimental methods used, detailing materials, readouts, controls, replicates, statistical analysis, thresholds, and whether these methods are generally approved for studying PD.

Looking at the context provided:

- The abstract mentions "mutant A53T α-synuclein." This is a specific variant. I need to standardize this using HGVS notation. From my knowledge, the wild-type α-synuclein is denoted as SNCA:NM_005624.4:c.160G>T (p.A53T). So, the HGVS should be NM_005624.4:c.160G>T.

- The disease is clearly Parkinson disease. I'll need to find its MONDO term, which I believe is MONDO:0004976.

For the experimental methods:

- The study used primary cortical neurons overexpressing mutant A53T α-synuclein. So, the material source is "Cell culture" with the name being these neurons.

- They activated macroautophagy and observed mitochondrial destruction using techniques like fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry for mitochondrial content. These would be the readouts, quantitative in nature.

- The abstract doesn't mention biological or technical replicates, so those will be N.D.

- Controls included silencing Parkin, overexpressing wild-type Mitofusin 2, etc., which are positive and negative controls.

- Statistical methods aren't detailed, so that's N.D.

- Thresholds for normal/abnormal results aren't specified in the abstract, but based on standard practices, a significant reduction in mitochondrial content might be considered abnormal.

- The experimental method of using autophagy activation in neurons to study PD is a common approach, so "Approved assay" would be Yes.

Putting all this together into the JSON structure as per the user's instructions.
