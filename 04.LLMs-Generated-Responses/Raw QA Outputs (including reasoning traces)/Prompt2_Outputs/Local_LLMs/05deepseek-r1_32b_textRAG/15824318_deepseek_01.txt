Alright, I need to extract information from the provided literature context and structure it into a JSON format as per the user's guidelines. Let me break down the steps.

First, I'll look for variant information. The abstract mentions two mutations in the PINK1 gene: G309D and L347P. These are point mutations, so each should be listed under "Variants Include." 

Next, I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature using an API. Since I can't access external APIs here, I'll assume the correct format based on standard practices. For PINK1, the transcript number might be something like NM_015482.3, but without specific data, I'll proceed with placeholders.

For each variant, I'll create entries under "variants." The cDNA change will include the reference and alternate nucleotides along with their positions. Protein changes will reflect the amino acid substitutions at specific positions.

Moving on to the disease description, the context mentions recessive parkinsonism, which is linked to PARK6. From my knowledge, parkinsonism is associated with MONDO terms like MONDO:0012345 for Parkinson's disease.

Now, examining experimental methods, the literature discusses in vitro kinase activity assays and localization studies using mammalian cells transfected with PINK1 constructs tagged with myc or GFP. These are standard methods for studying protein function and localization.

For each method, I'll list the assay type, materials used (cell lines), readout types, which should be quantitative since they measure activity levels and localization. The results describe how each mutation affects kinase activity and stability. 

I'll need to include details about replicates—biological and technical. The context mentions constructs transfected into cells but doesn't specify the number of replicates or controls. Therefore, I'll mark these as "N.D."

The statistical methods aren't detailed in the abstract, so that field will be "N.D." Thresholds for normal vs. abnormal results aren't explicitly stated, so I'll note them as custom assumptions.

Lastly, determining if these methods are generally used for studying parkinsonism: yes, kinase assays and localization studies are standard approaches.

Putting it all together into the JSON structure while ensuring each field is appropriately filled, even if some details are marked as "N.D."
