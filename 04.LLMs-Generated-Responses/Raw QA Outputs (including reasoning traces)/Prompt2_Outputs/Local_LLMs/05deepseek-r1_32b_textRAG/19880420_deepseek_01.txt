Alright, so I need to extract information from the given literature and structure it into JSON format as specified. Let's go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Variants Include section. The abstract mentions mutations in PINK1 and parkin causing PD. However, the specific HGVS nomenclature isn't provided here. So I'll note that no variants are explicitly mentioned beyond the gene names.

Next, Described Disease should be Parkinson disease (PD). To find the MONDO term, I can look it up. Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0012376.

For Experiment Method, the literature describes experiments involving PINK1 and parkin phosphorylation. The methods include assays to measure E3 ligase function, ubiquitination, and NF-kB signaling. They used cell lines or recombinant proteins as materials.

However, since no specific variants are detailed, the Readout description remains empty. Replicates, controls, statistical methods aren't mentioned either. So these sections will be marked N.D.

The assay methods described (phosphorylation assays, E3 ligase activity) are standard for studying PD pathogenesis, so "Approved assay" is Yes.
