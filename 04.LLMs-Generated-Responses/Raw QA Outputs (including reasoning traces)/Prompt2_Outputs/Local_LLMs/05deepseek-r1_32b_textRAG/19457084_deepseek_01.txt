Okay, I need to extract detailed information from the provided abstract. The user wants this data structured in JSON format with specific fields filled out based on the literature.

First, looking at the Variants Include section. The abstract mentions three mutations: A53T, A30P, and E46K in the a-synuclein gene (SNCA). I'll need to standardize these using HGVS nomenclature via an API. But since I don't have direct access here, I'll note their positions as described.

Next, for Described Disease, Parkinson's disease is clearly mentioned. I should retrieve its MONDO term. From my knowledge, Parkinson's disease corresponds to MONDO:0004982.

Now, moving on to Experiment Method. The abstract doesn't detail specific experimental methods like Western Blot or immunohistochemistry. It refers to in vitro and in vivo models but lacks specifics about the assays used. Therefore, many fields will be marked as N.D., indicating not described.

I'll fill out what I can, marking areas without information appropriately. For example, Readout description isn't specified, so it's N.D. Similarly, details about replicates, controls, and statistical methods aren't provided in the abstract, so those sections remain empty or use placeholders.

Finally, since no specific experimental protocols are detailed, I can't determine if they're generally used for studying Parkinson's disease, so that field is also N.D.
