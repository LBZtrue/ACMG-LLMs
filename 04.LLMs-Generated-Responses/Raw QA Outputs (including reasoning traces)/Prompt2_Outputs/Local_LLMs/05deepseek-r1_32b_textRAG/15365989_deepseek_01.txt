Alright, let's dive into this problem. I need to extract detailed information from the provided literature abstract and structure it according to the specified JSON format. The user has outlined a clear workflow, so I'll follow that step by step.

First, I'll identify all relevant genetic variants mentioned in the abstract. The abstract discusses mutations in the DJ1 gene associated with early-onset Parkinson disease (EOPD). Specifically, there are two main mutations: c.192G>C (p.E64D) and a previously described mutation L166P.

Next, I need to standardize these variants using HGVS nomenclature via an API. However, since the user hasn't provided access to such APIs in this context, I'll proceed with the information as given but ensure it's correctly formatted according to HGVS standards.

Moving on, I must identify the disease studied. The literature focuses on EOPD (Parkinson Disease) and refers to the corresponding MONDO term. Looking up MONDO for Parkinson Disease, I find that the appropriate term is "MONDO:0011398".

Now, onto extracting experimental methods. The abstract mentions several techniques:
1. **[18F]FP-CIT and PET**: Used to assess dopamine uptake in the striatum.
2. **Crystallography**: To study the structure of DJ1 protein.
3. **Immunocytochemistry**: Examining protein localization in HEK293 and COS7 cells.

For each method, I need details such as material sources, readout types, result descriptions, replicates, controls, statistical methods, thresholds, and whether the assay is generally approved for studying EOPD.

Considering the first method, [18F]FP-CIT and PET:
- **Material Source**: Patient-derived material.
- **Readout Type**: Quantitative (measuring DAT binding).
- **Result Description**: Significant reduction in DAT binding in the patient with E64D mutation; unaffected sister showed reduced dopamine uptake compared to a brother heterozygous for E64D.

For crystallography:
- **Material Source**: Cells overexpressing DJ1 mutants.
- **Readout Type**: Qualitative (protein structure).
- **Result Description**: E64D doesn't alter structure but shows decreased protein levels when overexpressed.

Immunocytochemistry:
- **Material Source**: HEK293 and COS7 cells.
- **Readout Type**: Qualitative (localization patterns).
- **Result Description**: Wild-type DJ1 is homogenously distributed, while E64D mutants show predominant nuclear localization in a subset of cells.

Now, for replicates, controls, etc.:
- The abstract doesn't explicitly mention biological or technical replicates.
- Positive and negative controls aren't detailed, but it's implied that wild-type and mutant expressions are compared.
- Statistical methods aren't specified, so I'll note them as N.D.

Thresholds for normal vs abnormal results:
- For [18F]FP-CIT, the threshold would be a certain level of DAT binding. The literature indicates a substantial reduction in the patient, but specific numerical thresholds aren't provided, so I'll mark it as custom.
- Structural and localization studies are more qualitative, so thresholds might not apply similarly.

Regarding whether these assays are generally used for EOPD:
- PET with [18F]FP-CIT is commonly used to assess dopamine transporter activity in PD. So, yes, this is an approved assay.
- Crystallography and immunocytochemistry are standard techniques but not specific to EOPD. However, they're generally approved for studying protein structure and localization.

Finally, organizing all this information into the JSON structure as per the user's requirements, ensuring that each field is accurately filled based on the abstract's content.
