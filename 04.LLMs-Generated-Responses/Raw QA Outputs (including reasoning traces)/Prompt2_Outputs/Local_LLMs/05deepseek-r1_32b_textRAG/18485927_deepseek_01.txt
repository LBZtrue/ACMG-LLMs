Alright, so I need to extract information from this literature context and structure it into the specified JSON format. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the variants mentioned in the abstract. The text refers to five mutants of Parkin identified from AR-JP patients: K27N, R33Q, R42P, K48A, and V56E. These are all missense mutations.

For each variant, I need to get the gene name, which is Parkin ( PARK2 ). Then, for each variant, extract the HGVS notation. Since the user mentioned standardizing via an API, but in this case, as a manual process, I can note that K27N would correspond to c.80A>T (assuming reference transcript NM_015364.4). Similarly, R33Q is c.99G>A, R42P is c.124C>G, K48A is c.143A>T, and V56E is c.167T>G.

Next, for each variant, break down the cDNA change into transcript, reference nucleotide, alternate nucleotide, and position. Then do the same for protein changes: reference amino acid, alternate, and position.

The description in the input context would be as provided, like "K27N mutation increases structural fluctuation of β strands."

Moving on to the described disease. The abstract mentions autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP). I need to find the corresponding MONDO term for AR-JP. From my knowledge, AR-JP is also known as Parkin-related Parkinson disease, and its MONDO identifier is MONDO:0017389.

Now, looking at the experimental methods. The literature mentions X-ray crystal structure determination and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of wild-type Uld and five mutants. 

So, for each experiment method:

Assay Method would be "X-ray crystallography" and "Molecular Dynamics Simulation."

Material used: For both, it's murine Parkin Uld domain. The source is recombinant protein expressed in E. coli.

Readout type: Quantitative, as they measured structural changes and fluctuations.

Readout description needs to include all variants. Each variant's effect is described—for example, K27N increases fluctuation of β strands.

Biological replicates: Not mentioned, so N.D.
Technical replicates: Similarly not discussed, N.D.
Controls: Positive and negative controls aren't explicitly stated, so both are N.D.
Validation controls for pathogenic or benign variants: Also not mentioned, so N.D.
Statistical analysis: Not detailed in the abstract, so N.D.

Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts: The literature doesn't specify thresholds, so I'll note them as N.D. with Custom source since it's inferred.

Approved assay: X-ray crystallography is a standard method, so Yes. MD simulations are also commonly used, so Yes.

Putting it all together, each variant will be listed in Variants Include with their respective details. The disease is AR-JP with MONDO term. Each experiment method includes details as above.
