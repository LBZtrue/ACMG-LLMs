Alright, let's break down the problem step by step. I'm tasked with extracting specific information from a given literature context and formatting it into JSON according to the provided structure. The focus is on genetic variants related to Parkinson disease (PD), the associated mutations, experimental methods used in the study, and ensuring all data is standardized using HGVS nomenclature and MONDO terms.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant variant information from the literature context. The abstract mentions three point mutations associated with early-onset familial PD: A30P, E46K, and A53T in α-synuclein (αSyn). These are missense mutations affecting amino acids at positions 30, 46, and 53 respectively.

Next, I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature for these variants. Since the literature doesn't provide specific transcript numbers or nucleotide changes, I'll have to look up the correct HGVS notations using appropriate APIs. For instance, A30P in αSyn would translate to a change at position 95 in the cDNA (assuming NM_001126112.3 as the reference transcript), converting adenine to thymine.

After standardizing the variants, I'll identify the disease studied, which is Parkinson disease. Retrieving the corresponding MONDO term from the database gives me MONDO:0004976 for Parkinson disease (PD).

Moving on to experimental methods, the literature describes experiments involving the 20S proteasome and liposomes to evaluate αSyn fragmentation and aggregation. The methods include in vitro assays where wildtype and mutant αSyn are subjected to proteolytic cleavage by the proteasome and tested for their ability to form amyloid fibrils.

I'll structure each experimental method with details such as material sources (cell-derived, recombinant proteins), readout types (qualitative observations of fibrillization), and include all variants in the Readout description. The study doesn't mention biological or technical replicates explicitly, so those fields will be marked as "N.D."

Control settings aren't detailed, but since the experiments compare mutant αSyn with wildtype, I'll infer that wildtype serves as a positive control and perhaps buffer alone as a negative control.

Statistical methods aren't described, so this field remains "N.D." Thresholds for normal vs. abnormal results also aren't specified, hence they'll be marked accordingly.

Finally, determining if these experimental methods are generally used for studying PD involves checking if in vitro proteasome assays and amyloid aggregation studies are standard approaches. Given that such assays are commonly employed in neurodegenerative research, I'll mark "Approved assay" as "Yes."

Throughout this process, it's crucial to ensure accuracy by cross-referencing data and using available resources for standardization. Any missing information is noted with "N.D." to maintain the integrity of the JSON structure.
