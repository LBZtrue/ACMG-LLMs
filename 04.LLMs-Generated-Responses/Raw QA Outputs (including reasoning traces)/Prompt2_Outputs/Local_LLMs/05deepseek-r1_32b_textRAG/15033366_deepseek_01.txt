Okay, I need to process the given literature and extract the required information into a JSON format as specified. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the abstract, I see that it discusses synuclein proteins and their role in inhibiting PLD2. The variants mentioned are A30P and A53T associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). So, my first task is to identify these genetic variants and standardize them using HGVS nomenclature.

Next, I need to determine the disease described. The literature mentions PD-associated mutants, so the disease is Parkinson's disease. Now, I'll look up the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. From what I know, MONDO:0012645 corresponds to Parkinson's disease.

Moving on to experimental methods, the abstract doesn't specify any particular assays used. It talks about analyzing mutations and their effects on PLD2 inhibition in vitro. So, perhaps the method is an enzymatic assay or a biochemical assay to measure PLD activity. However, without explicit details, I'll note that the experimental methods are not described, so many fields will be marked as "N.D."

For each variant, I need to extract their HGVS, cDNA changes, and protein changes. The variants are A30P (Ala30Pro) and A53T (Ala53Thr). I'll use the transcript number provided, which is NM_001126112.3 for a-synuclein.

Now, standardizing HGVS using an API. Assuming that NM_001126112.3:c.91G>C corresponds to A30P and c.158G>A corresponds to A53T. I'll structure each variant under the gene SNCA (snc alpha, a-synuclein).

Regarding experimental methods, since there's no detailed description in the literature provided, most of these fields will be "N.D." or not mentioned.

Finally, compiling all this into the JSON structure as per the user's instructions. I'll ensure that each section is filled accurately, with any missing information appropriately marked.
