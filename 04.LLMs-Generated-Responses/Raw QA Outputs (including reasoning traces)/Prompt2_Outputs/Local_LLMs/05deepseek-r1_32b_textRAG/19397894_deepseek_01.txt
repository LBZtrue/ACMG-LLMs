Okay, I need to tackle this query. The user is an expert in analyzing literature data and wants a structured JSON response based on the provided abstract about LRRK2 mutations and their effect on ATP affinity and kinase activity in Parkinson's disease.

First, let me extract the variants mentioned. The abstract talks about G2019S and I2020T mutations. Both are in LRRK2. I should standardize these using HGVS nomenclature via an API. Let me check what the correct transcript is for LRRK2. I recall it's often NM_005678.3, so I'll use that.

Next, I need to structure each variant. For G2019S, the cDNA change would be g.2019G>T and protein from Glycine (G) to Serine (S). Similarly, I2020T is a missense mutation from Isoleucine to Threonine at position 2020.

Moving on to the disease description. The abstract mentions Parkinson's disease, specifically late-onset autosomal dominant PD. I need to find the MONDO term for this. From my knowledge, Parkinson’s disease is MONDO:0018945.

Now, looking at experimental methods. The abstract uses binding assays and enzymatic assays. These are generally accepted methods for studying kinase activity in PD research. 

For each assay method, I need details like material sources, which here would be recombinant proteins or cell lines expressing the mutants. Readout type is quantitative since they measure ATP affinity and inhibitor resistance.

The readout description should include both variants. G2019S has lower ATP affinity (about 2-fold) and higher sensitivity to inhibitors (6-fold), while I2020T has higher ATP affinity (6-fold) and more resistant (10-fold). These conclusions suggest altered kinase activity, so the molecular effect is a gain-of-function for G2019S and either partial loss or gain for I2020T based on conflicting data.

The abstract doesn't mention biological or technical replicates explicitly. It also doesn’t discuss controls like positive or negative controls, validation counts, statistical methods, or specific thresholds for normal/abnormal results. So those fields will be marked as N.D.

Finally, the experimental methods are approved as they're standard in kinase studies for PD.

I need to ensure all this info is correctly formatted into JSON without missing any fields and using "N.D." where information isn't available.
