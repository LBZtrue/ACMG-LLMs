Alright, so I'm trying to extract information from this scientific literature about LRRK2 mutations and their role in parkinsonism. The user wants a detailed JSON output with variants, disease info, and experimental methods. First, let me go through the abstract and introduction.

The abstract mentions that G2019S is the most common variant globally, but G2385R is more frequent in Asia. They used transgenic Drosophila overexpressing LRRK2 alleles: wild type, G2019S, Y1699C, and G2385R. The flies with these variants showed late-onset loss of DA neurons, locomotion deficits, reduced lifespan, and increased sensitivity to rotenone. Coexpression of parkin in G2019S-expressing flies provided protection.

So the variants are G2019S, Y1699C, and G2385R. The gene is LRRK2. I need to standardize their HGVS nomenclature using an API. For example, for G2019S, the transcript would be something like NM_..., but since the literature doesn't specify, I'll mark it as N.D.

The disease mentioned is parkinsonism, specifically LRRK2-related parkinsonism. I need to find the MONDO term for this. It might be under Parkinson's disease or a subtype. Checking the MONDO database could help, but if not found, I'll leave it as N.D.

Next, the experimental methods. They used transgenic Drosophila (fruit flies) overexpressing the LRRK2 variants. The readouts were DA neuron loss, locomotion deficits, lifespan reduction, and rotenone sensitivity. Coexpression with parkin showed protective effects.

For each method, I need details like material source (transgenic flies), description of materials (wild-type vs mutants). Readout types are quantitative (e.g., count of neurons) or qualitative (like presence of neurodegeneration). Each variant's result is described in the literature. The readout descriptions should include all variants mentioned.

Biological replicates: They probably used multiple fly lines, so yes, but the exact number isn't specified. Technical replicates might involve measuring the same flies multiple times, but that's not clear. Positive controls were wild-type flies without mutations; negative controls were likely the wild-type LRRK2 or non-transgenic flies.

Validation controls for pathogenic vs benign variants: The literature compares mutants to wild type, so it includes basic positive and negative controls but doesn't mention specific validation counts for P/LP or B/LB.

Statistical methods aren't detailed, but common ones like t-tests might be used. Thresholds for normal vs abnormal weren't specified, so I'll note that as N.D.

Approved assay: Using Drosophila models is a standard method in neurodegenerative research, so yes, it's an approved approach.

Putting this all together into the JSON format, ensuring each section is filled with the extracted data and standardized where possible.
