Alright, I need to analyze the provided literature context and extract the necessary information as per the user's instructions. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I notice that the context mentions "patient's PINK1 mut fibroblasts." This indicates that the gene involved is PINK1, and there's a mutation. However, the specific HGVS nomenclature isn't provided, so I'll have to note that as "N.D." for now. The protein change is also not mentioned, so that will remain "N.D." as well.

Next, the disease being studied here is related to PINK1 mutations. PINK1 is commonly associated with Early-Onset Parkinson's Disease. I'll need to look up the MONDO term for this disease. According to the MONDO database, the term for Early-Onset Parkinson's Disease is MONDO:0006643.

Moving on to the experimental methods. The context mentions the use of TMRE fluorescence intensity assessed by digital analysis with ImageJ software. This suggests that the assay method is a "Fluorescence Assay" using TMRE. The material used is patient-derived fibroblasts, specifically PINK1 mutant fibroblasts, and control NDHFs (normal human dermal fibroblasts).

The readout type is quantitative since they're measuring fluorescence intensity. The readout description should include all variants, but since the variant details are not provided, I'll note "N.D."

Looking at the experimental replicates, the context states that 80-100 randomly chosen areas from 10 different optical fields were analyzed. This implies that technical replicates were performed, but there's no mention of biological replicates, so I'll mark that as "N.D."

For controls, the basic positive control isn't explicitly mentioned, but the control fibroblasts are used as a reference for normalization, which can be considered a basic negative control. 

Statistical analysis is mentioned with "N.S." indicating not statistically significant, but the exact method isn't specified, so that's "N.D." The thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts are based on the control's signal intensity.

Finally, fluorescence assays using TMRE are commonly used to assess mitochondrial membrane potential, which is relevant for studying mitochondrial diseases like Parkinson's. Therefore, the assay is approved for studying this disease.
