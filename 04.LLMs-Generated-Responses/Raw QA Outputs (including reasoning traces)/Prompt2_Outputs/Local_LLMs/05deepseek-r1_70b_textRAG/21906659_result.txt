Okay, I need to analyze the provided literature context and extract the necessary information following the user's detailed instructions. Let's go through each section step by step.

First, I'll look for genetic variants. The context mentions introducing the A30P mutation using site-directed mutagenesis. The gene is α-syn (SNCA), and the variant is A30P. The cDNA change is at position 30, G to C, leading to the protein change from A to P at position 30. So, the HGVS should be standardized. I'll need to use an API to get the correct transcript number, but since I don't have access, I'll note it as not standardized yet.

Next, the disease studied isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll mark it as N.D. for MONDO as well.

Moving on to experimental methods. The context describes two assays: Western blotting and cell viability assessment. 

For Western blotting, the material used is PC12/TetOn cells expressing α-syn(WT). The readout is quantitative, measuring protein expression levels. They used three replicates and performed one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test. The positive control was the wild-type, and the negative control was the empty vector. There's no mention of validation controls, so those are N.D.

For the cell viability assay, the same cells and experimental setup were used. The readout is qualitative, assessing cell viability. Again, three replicates and the same statistical method. Positive and negative controls are the same as the Western blot. No validation controls mentioned here either.

I need to determine if these methods are approved for studying the disease, but since the disease isn't specified, I'll leave it as N.D.

Finally, I'll structure all this information into the provided JSON format, ensuring no fields are omitted and using "N.D." where necessary.
