Alright, I need to extract specific information from the provided literature context and structure it into a JSON format as per the user's guidelines. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and identifying the relevant sections.

First, looking for genetic variants. The context mentions several genes: HSPA6, VGF, and FASTKD3. However, it doesn't provide specific HGVS nomenclature or detailed variant information like cDNA or protein changes. This is a bit challenging because the user expects standardized HGVS via an API, but without specific variants, I can't proceed with that step. So, I'll have to note this as N.D. for each variant field.

Next, the disease description. The literature doesn't explicitly mention a disease studied. It talks about protein expression and mass spectrometry but doesn't link it to a specific disease. Without this information, I can't retrieve a MONDO term. Therefore, I'll mark both the disease name and MONDO term as N.D.

Moving on to experimental methods. The context mentions the use of Progenesis for calculating protein values and mass spectrometry for identification. It also refers to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD). So, the assay methods are Mass Spectrometry and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.

For each method, I need to extract details about materials, readouts, replicates, controls, etc. The context doesn't specify the material source or name, so those are N.D. Readout type is quantitative because protein expression levels are measured. However, since no variants are detailed, the readout description can't include specific variants, so it remains N.D.

Regarding replicates and controls, the literature doesn't provide information on whether biological or technical replicates were performed, nor does it mention positive or negative controls. Therefore, all these fields will be N.D.

Statistical analysis is mentioned briefly, but the method isn't specified, so that's also N.D. The context does provide a volume threshold of 0.02%, which relates to the threshold for abnormal readout. Since this is from the literature, the source is Literature. However, without a normal threshold mentioned, that remains N.D.

Lastly, determining if the assay is approved for the disease is tricky without knowing the disease. Both fields under "Approved assay" will be N.D.

In summary, the JSON structure will have placeholders (N.D.) for most fields due to insufficient information in the provided context. Only the assay methods and some thresholds are partially filled based on the available data.
