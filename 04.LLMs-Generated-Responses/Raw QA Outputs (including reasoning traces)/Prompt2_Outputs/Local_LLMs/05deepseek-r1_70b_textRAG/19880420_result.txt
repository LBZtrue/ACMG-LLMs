Okay, I need to extract information from the provided scientific literature and structure it into a JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let's start by identifying the key sections in the literature.

First, I notice the literature discusses PINK1 mutations and their role in early-onset familial Parkinson's Disease (PD). So, the gene involved is PINK1. The variants mentioned are G309D, L347P, and the catalytically inactive KDD triple mutant (K219A/D362A/D384A). Also, there are mentions of R42P and G430D mutations.

Next, I need to structure each variant with their HGVS nomenclature. Since the user mentioned using an API for standardization, I'll assume the correct transcript numbers. For example, G309D would be on the PINK1 transcript, so it would be something like NM_015675.2:c.926G>A. I'll do this for each variant, ensuring the cDNA and protein changes are correctly noted.

The disease studied is Parkinson's Disease, specifically early-onset familial PD. I'll need to find the MONDO term for this. MONDO terms are usually in the format MONDO:XXXXXXX. For Parkinson's Disease, I believe it's MONDO:0009899, but I should verify this. Since I can't access external databases, I'll note it as such.

Now, looking at the experimental methods. The literature mentions using expression constructs with wild-type and mutant PINK1, and they performed immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c antibody. So, the assay method is Western Blot. The materials used are likely cell lines, such as HEK293, which is a common cell line in such studies.

For readouts, the literature states that cytochrome c release was determined by immunoblotting. So, the readout type is Qualitative. The variants mentioned would have their protein changes affecting cytochrome c release, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction.

The statistical analysis mentions experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times, using ANOVA with a p-value <0.05 considered significant. So, biological replicates are yes, with three repeats, and technical replicates are yes, in triplicate.

Controls: The literature doesn't specify positive or negative controls, so I'll mark those as N.D. Similarly, validation controls for pathogenic or benign variants aren't mentioned, so those are N.D. as well.

Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren't provided, but based on standard practices, normal might be no cytochrome c release, and abnormal would be increased release. I'll note the source as Custom since it's inferred.

Lastly, Western Blot is a widely used assay for studying PD, so "Approved assay" is yes.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the variants, disease info, and experimental details as extracted.
