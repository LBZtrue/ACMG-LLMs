Okay, I need to help the user by extracting detailed information from the provided literature context and organizing it into a specific JSON format. Let me go through the literature step by step.

First, I notice that the context mentions experiments with GFP-tagged dardarin and SH-SY5Y cells. However, the specific genetic variants aren't explicitly stated. The context talks about wild-type and mutant proteins being expressed at similar levels, but without particular HGVS nomenclature provided.

Looking at the disease, the literature doesn't explicitly mention a disease name. It focuses on protein expression experiments, so I'll note that as N.D. for MONDO since there's no specific disease identified.

Next, the experimental methods. The context refers to quantitation of GFP-tagged dardarin expression, which suggests a fluorescence or microscopy assay. They used cell lines like SH-SY5Y and mention technical replicates (n=4) and at least 50 cells counted, so biological replicates are involved.

For controls, there's a mention of GFP-CAT as a control protein, indicating a positive control. I don't see a negative control specified, so I'll mark that as N.D. Validation controls for variants aren't discussed, so those fields will be N.D. too.

Statistical analysis isn't detailed, but they did multiple replicates, so I assume basic statistical methods were used. Thresholds for normal and abnormal aren't provided, so I'll use custom thresholds based on typical protein expression experiments.

Since the assay method isn't a standard one for a specific disease (as the disease isn't mentioned), I'll say the assay isn't approved for studying a particular disease.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with the available info, using N.D. where details are missing.
