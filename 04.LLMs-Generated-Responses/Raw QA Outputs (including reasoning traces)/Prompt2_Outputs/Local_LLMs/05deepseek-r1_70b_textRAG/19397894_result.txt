Okay, I need to extract information from the given literature and structure it into the specified JSON format. Let me go step by step.

First, looking at the abstract and the context provided, the main focus is on mutations in the LRRK2 gene, specifically G2019S and I2020T, associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). I'll start by identifying the variants.

From the abstract, the G2019S mutation is mentioned to have higher kinase activity, and I2020T has lower activity. The context also refers to the TR-FRET binding assays and enzymatic assays used. 

I'll structure the Variants Include section with the LRRK2 gene and its variants. I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature. Assuming I have access to an API, I'll convert the given variants into proper HGVS format. For example, G2019S would be something like NM_000455.4:c.6027G>A (p.Gly2019Ser), and I2020T would be NM_000455.4:c.6059T>C (p.Ile2020Thr).

Next, the disease described is Parkinson's disease. I'll retrieve the MONDO term for PD, which is MONDO:0004982.

Now, moving on to the experimental methods. The context mentions TR-FRET binding assays and enzymatic assays. I'll list both methods.

For each assay, I need to detail the materials used. The TR-FRET binding assay used a specific antibody and a plate reader. The enzymatic assays measured kinase activity using substrate phosphorylation.

The readout type for TR-FRET is quantitative, measuring binding, and for enzymatic assays, it's also quantitative, measuring kinase activity. The readout descriptions should include both variants, G2019S showing higher activity and I2020T showing lower activity.

Looking at replicates, the enzymatic assays were performed with three or four replicates. Technical replicates were done in triplicate for TR-FRET. There's no mention of biological replicates, so I'll mark that as N.D.

Controls: The TR-FRET used a positive control with a specific antibody, and the enzymatic assay didn't mention negative controls, so that's N.D. There's no mention of validation controls, so those are also N.D.

Statistical analysis isn't detailed, so I'll note that as N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts aren't provided, but based on standard practices, I'll set normal as activity within the wild-type range and abnormal as outside that range, sourced from custom knowledge.

Approved assay: TR-FRET and enzymatic assays are standard for studying kinase activity in PD, so I'll mark them as approved.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring all fields are filled as per the template, using "N.D." where information isn't available.
