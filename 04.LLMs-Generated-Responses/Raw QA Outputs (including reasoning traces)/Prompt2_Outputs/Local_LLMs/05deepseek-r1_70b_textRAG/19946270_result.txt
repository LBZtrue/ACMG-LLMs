Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a detailed prompt asking for the extraction of specific information from a given literature context and formatting it into a JSON structure. They've also provided an example and some constraints on how to do this.

First, I need to understand the structure of the JSON they want. It includes sections on Variants, Described Disease, and Experiment Methods. Each of these has nested fields with specific requirements, like HGVS nomenclature, disease terms from MONDO, and detailed experimental method descriptions.

Looking at the provided context, it seems to be a methods section of a scientific paper. It mentions tools like Polyscan 3.0 and a genomic mutation consequence calculator. They also reference datasets from GEO and other sources. The context also includes a table about PARK2 mutations in cancers and supplementary materials.

The user wants me to extract variants, diseases, and experimental methods. From the context, I can see mentions of PARK2 and GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) datasets. So, I can infer that the disease is likely Glioblastoma, which would map to a MONDO term.

For variants, the context doesn't list specific HGVS entries, so I'll have to note that as N.D. Similarly, the experimental methods section in the context talks about tools like Polyscan and mutation calculators, but without specific assay details, I'll have to mark most fields as N.D.

I also need to consider the constraints: using "N.D." where information isn't available, standardizing HGVS via an API (though in this case, there are no variants to standardize), and retrieving MONDO terms. Since the disease is GBM, I can look up its MONDO ID, which I believe is MONDO:0005737.

Putting this all together, the JSON structure will have placeholders where specific data isn't provided in the context. I'll structure each section as per the template, ensuring all fields are included even if they're marked as N.D.

Finally, I'll make sure the JSON is correctly formatted and adheres to the user's specifications, avoiding any markdown and keeping it raw as per their request.
