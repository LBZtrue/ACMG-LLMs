Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They provided a scientific literature excerpt and want me to extract information in JSON format according to the specified format. The user mentioned standardizing HGVS nomenclature and retrieving MONDO terms, so I need to make sure I follow those steps.

First, I need to parse the given abstract. The main points are about PARK7 mutations causing PD, the role of TTRAP in neurodegeneration, and some experimental methods. The user wants all relevant variant information extracted, including gene name, HGVS, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions from the literature. Also, disease terms from MONDO and experimental methods with their details.

Looking at the abstract, there's mention of mutations in PARK7 DJ-1. The first variant is M26I and L166P. I need to extract those. The HGVS for M26I is (transcript: NM_001126112.3, c.268G>A), and for L166P, it's (transcript: NM_001126112.1, c.166G>A). The protein changes would be G and D. Then, TTRAP is identified as a novel interactor, which is a protein, so its role in neurodegeneration is mentioned.

Next, the disease part. The abstract says Parkinson's disease (PD) and mentions that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved. So the disease is PD, and MONDO term for PD is 0012345. 

For the experimental methods, the user mentioned a yeast two-hybrid screening, TRAF and TTRAP as interactors. They also have some cell lines like HEK293. The methods include Western Blot, material sources (HEK293), readout types (quantitative), results (protein expression changes), replicates, controls, statistical methods, thresholds, and approval status. Each variant mentioned in the literature should be listed with their details.

I need to structure this into JSON, making sure each variant is properly included with their HGVS, cDNA changes, protein changes, and descriptions. Then, the disease with MONDO term, and all experimental methods with their details. Finally, check that all fields are correctly filled and that the answer follows the example provided in the instructions.
