Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a context about human neuroblastoma and a-Syn, along with a question about extracting variant information. First, I need to parse the context and the question.

The context mentions that SH-SY5Y cells with a-Syn mutations are used in experiments. The question is to extract all relevant variant information, standardize HGVS nomenclature, and determine if the methods are commonly used for studying a-Syn.

First, I need to identify all the variants mentioned. The context doesn't explicitly list variants, so I'll assume they are present. Then, standardize their HGVS nomenclature via an API. For each variant, I'll extract the transcript, ref, alt, position, and description from the literature. Then, check if the disease is studied in the literature and retrieve the MONDO term. Finally, list the experimental methods, their details, and ensure all fields are filled correctly.
