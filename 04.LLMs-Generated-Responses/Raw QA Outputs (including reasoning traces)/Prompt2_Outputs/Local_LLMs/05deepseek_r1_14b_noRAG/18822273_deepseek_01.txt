Alright, I've been given a query where the user wants me to process a context and provide a structured JSON output based on specific instructions. The context is a scientific article discussing experiments with variants in the TP53 gene related to hereditary myopathy.

First, I need to understand what exactly the user is asking for. They want me to extract variant information, standardize HGVS nomenclature using an API, identify the disease and retrieve its MONDO term, list all experimental methods with detailed info, and determine if these methods are commonly used for studying the disease.

Looking at the context provided, it's about a study in TP53 involving variants like c.248G>A (p.G83D). The experiments include techniques like Western Blot, qPCR, etc., using materials such as HEK293 cells and tissues from mice. Results show that these variants affect protein expression levels.

I need to extract each variant's details: gene name, HGVS notation, cDNA and protein changes. Then, I'll standardize the HGVS using an API. The disease here is hereditary myopathy, so I have to find its corresponding MONDO ID.

Next, for each experiment method mentioned (Western Blot, qPCR, etc.), I'll note down the material sources, readout types, and other details like replicates and controls. I also need to assess if these methods are approved for studying this disease.

I should be careful to structure all this information into the provided JSON format precisely, ensuring that each section is correctly nested and contains accurate data based on the context given.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Extract variant details from the context.
2. Standardize HGVS using an API.
3. Identify the disease and get its MONDO term.
4. List all experimental methods with their details.
5. Determine if each method is approved for studying the disease.
6. Organize everything into the specified JSON structure.

I must ensure that all data points are accurate and follow the format provided in the example, making it easy for the user to parse or use this information programmatically.
