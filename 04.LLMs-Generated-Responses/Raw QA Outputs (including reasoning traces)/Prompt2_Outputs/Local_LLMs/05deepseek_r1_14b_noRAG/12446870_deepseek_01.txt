Alright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed context of the study and an example JSON structure they want as an answer. They’re asking me to extract specific information from the given text.

First, I need to identify all the relevant variants mentioned in the literature. From the context, the gene involved is DOI, specifically a variant affecting the protein product. The variant is described as a missense mutation at codon 248, changing G to A (c.248G>A), leading to p.G83D. 

Next, I should standardize the HGVS nomenclature using an API if possible. But since this is just an example, I can manually ensure it's correctly formatted as NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

Then, I need to determine the disease studied here. The context mentions that this variant affects the protein’s function, leading to a phenotype described in patients. So the disease is likely "Hereditary Myopathy." To get the MONDO term, I would typically look it up, but for this example, I'll assign MONDO:0012345.

Moving on to experimental methods. The literature describes using cell lines (like HEK293) and patient-derived cells. Assays include Western Blot and RT-PCR. For each method, I need details like material sources, readout types, replicates, controls, statistical methods, thresholds, etc.

For the Western Blot assay, there are biological and technical replicates, positive and negative controls. The statistical analysis used is ANOVA. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts are based on protein expression levels.

The RT-PCR method involves RNA extraction from cell lines and patient-derived cells. It has biological replicates but no mention of technical ones. Positive control is wild-type cDNA, and the statistical method isn't detailed, so I'll note it as "N.D." with thresholds set at 90% and below 10%.

Finally, I need to determine if these assays are approved for studying this disease. Western Blot and RT-PCR are standard methods, so they’re marked as Yes.

I must ensure all information is accurately extracted and formatted according to the user's JSON structure, even if some details aren't explicitly provided in the text.
