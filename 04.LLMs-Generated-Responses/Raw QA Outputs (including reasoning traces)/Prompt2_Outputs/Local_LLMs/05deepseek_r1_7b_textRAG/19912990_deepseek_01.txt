Okay, I need to help the user by analyzing this literature and extracting the necessary information into a JSON format. Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.

The abstract mentions that LRRK2 is involved in autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). It talks about two mutants, I2020T and another variant. The key points are:

1. The I2020T mutant has higher susceptibility to post-translational degradation compared to the wild-type.
2. This mutation impairs apoptosis resistance in hydrogen peroxide treatment but can be restored with proteolysis inhibitors.
3. Lower levels of WT LRRK2 protein lead to decreased protective effect against apoptosis.

Now, looking at the Introduction part, it explains that LRRK2 is a gene linked to PD, specifically PARK8. It discusses its role as a receptor-interacting protein and mentions various domains with mutations.

The user wants me to extract variant information, disease details from MONDO, experimental methods with their specifics, and determine if these methods are approved for the disease.

First, I'll extract the variants. The literature only mentions the I2020T mutant in LRRK2. So, gene is LRRK2. The HGVS nomenclature isn't explicitly given, but it's implied to be a missense mutation at I2020. So, maybe I can standardize that as (wild-type transcript):c.I2020T.

Next, for the disease, it's clearly stated as autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease, so Described Disease is PD and MONDO term should be looked up. From the context, I don't see the exact MONDO term, but since it's about LRRK2 mutations in PD, I can infer that the term exists or find it via API.

For experimental methods, the literature mentions proteolysis inhibitors (e.g., Bafiloxin) to rescue the protective effect. They tested apoptosis under hydrogen peroxide and found that lower WT protein levels impaired the effect. So the assay here is a cytotoxicity assay using H2O2, with specific conditions like 37°C for 24 hours.

The materials used are HEK293 cells. The readout type is quantitative (cytotoxicity). They did biological replicates and controlled experiments where they tested both WT and I2020T. Positive controls included wild-type protein plus proteolysis inhibitors, and negative control was without treatment.

Statistical methods weren't specified in the context, so it's N.D. The threshold for normal is not provided, but based on standard cytotoxicity assays, 100% viability could be considered normal, though in some cases, it might differ.

Now, checking if these experiments are approved. Western blot is a standard method and approved for studying PD.

Putting this all together into the JSON structure as per user instructions.
