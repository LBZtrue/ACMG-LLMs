Alright, so I need to analyze the provided literature abstract and context to extract information about genetic variants, the disease, experimental methods, and standardize everything into a JSON format. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the abstract, it mentions that the G2385Arg variant in LRRK2 is associated with PD. I should note this variant's HGVS nomenclature. The context also describes Gly2385 being replaced from glycine to arginine, which increases the net positive charge of the WD40 domain. So, the protein change would be a gain-of-function mutation.

Next, for the disease, it clearly states that the study focuses on PD in Singaporeans, so the described disease is Parkinson's Disease (PD). I'll check MONDO to find the corresponding term, which should relate to neurodegenerative diseases.

Now, looking at the experimental methods section. The study tested the LRRK2 variant using Western blot on cell lines after inducing oxidative stress. They mentioned both wild type and Gly2385Arg variants were tested. The readout was qualitative based on protein band movement. There's only one biological replicate, no mention of technical replicates.

For controls, they used a positive control with wild-type cDNA and negative controls like empty vector or K63-kinase inhibitor treated cells. No validation controls for P/LP or B/LB are mentioned here. The statistical method was presumably Student’s t-test since it's common in such studies unless specified otherwise.

The threshold results showed that the Gly2385Arg variant led to a 40% decrease in protein band intensity compared to wild type, which is considered abnormal based on their established cutoff of ≥1.5 fold change.

I also need to ensure all HGVS nomenclatures are standardized using APIs and retrieve disease terms from MONDO correctly.
