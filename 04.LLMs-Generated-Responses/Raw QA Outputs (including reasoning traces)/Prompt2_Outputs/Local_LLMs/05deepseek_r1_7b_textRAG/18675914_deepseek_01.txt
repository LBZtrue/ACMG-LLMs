Alright, I need to help the user by analyzing the provided literature and extracting detailed information according to their specifications. The goal is to structure this information into a JSON format with specific fields.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction of the provided context to identify relevant variants, disease terms, and experimental methods.

From the abstract: LRRK2 mutations such as Y1699C and G2019S cause parkinsonian symptoms. These mutations affect MAPK pathways, specifically ERK activation upon oxidative stress.

In the introduction: LRRK2 is a ROCO gene with a 285 kDa protein encoded by the gene. The domain analysis shows the sequence starts after the first 1000 amino acids. The mutation Y1699C reduces cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells, indicating it's more toxic than G2019S.

So, the variants mentioned are Y1699C and G2019S. Both are in LRRK2, but only Y1699C affects cell viability. The disease studied is Parkinsonism ( idiopathic ), which can be linked to MONDO:0008437.

For the experiment methods, the study mentions expression of wild-type and mutant LRRK2 in HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells. They tested oxidative stress tolerance with H2O2 induction. The results showed enhanced stress tolerance for wild-type compared to mutants via ERK activation. This suggests using HEK293 cells, measuring protein levels (quantitative), Western Blot as the assay.

Control aspects: biological replicates are mentioned but not specified; likely "No" since it's a single cell line per experiment. No mention of technical replicates or controls like positive/negative, so set to N.D. Statistical methods aren't detailed, so use N.D.

The assay (Western Blot) is generally used for studying protein function and pathways related to Parkinsonism, hence "Approved assay" is Yes.

Now, I'll structure this into the JSON format as per the user's instructions.
