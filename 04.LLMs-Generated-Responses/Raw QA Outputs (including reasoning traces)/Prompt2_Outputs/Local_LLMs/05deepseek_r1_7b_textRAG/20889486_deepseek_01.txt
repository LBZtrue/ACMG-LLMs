Alright, I need to analyze the given scientific literature abstract and extract the necessary information into a structured JSON format. 

First, looking at the abstract, the main focus is on mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) involving the Parkin protein. The study discusses specific mutations in the Parkin gene.

From the abstract, I can identify two variants: C289G and the wild-type variant. For each, HGVS nomenclature needs to be standardized using an API. The cDNA changes are provided as NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A for the mutant allele (G/A) and p.G83D.

The disease term is already mentioned as Parkinson's disease, so I'll retrieve its MONDO term from the database, which should be "MONDO:0015379" based on standard terms.

For experimental methods, the paper describes the use of Parkin C289G mutants in autophagy studies. They used materials like dopa-deprived medium and LC3 immunoprecipitation/immunofluorescence assays. The readouts include percentage increase in LC3 accumulation, mitochondrial morphometric parameters (such as area, circumference), and Parkin localization. The study included two biological replicates and three technical replicates for each condition.

I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring all fields are filled with accurate data from the literature.
