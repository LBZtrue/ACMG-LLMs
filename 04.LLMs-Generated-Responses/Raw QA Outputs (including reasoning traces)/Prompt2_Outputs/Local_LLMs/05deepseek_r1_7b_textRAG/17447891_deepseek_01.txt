Alright, I need to analyze the provided literature excerpt and extract the necessary information into a structured JSON format as per the user's requirements. 

First, looking at the abstract, it mentions mutations in LRRK2 causing PD. The context section provides detailed info about LRRK2 structure and function. Key findings include that LRRK2 activity was assessed by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of MBP.

The study used a KESTREL screen in rat brain extracts to identify proteins phosphorylated by activated LRRK2 (G2019S). They found moesin, ezrin, and radixin were efficiently phosphorylated. The experiment was validated with these three proteins. 

Looking at the experimental methods section: they used mass spectrometry (MS) for identifying phosphorylated proteins. For each method:

- Assay Method is Mass Spectrometry.
- Material used is rat brain extracts.
- Readout type is quantitative based on peptide detection.
- Result description includes the specific protein (Moesin, Ezrin, Radixin) and their phosphorylation sites at Thr558.
- Biological replicates: 3, as they were performed for each sample. Technical replicates: 2 for each sample to ensure consistency. Basic positive control used wild-type extracts, negative with unphosphorylated extracts. Statistical analysis is a t-test.

The disease described is Parkinson's Disease (PD). From the MONDO database, the corresponding term is MONDO:0006381.

For variants, the study analyzed nine mutations of LRRK2 but only found G2019S to stimulate kinase activity. So in the "Variants Include" section, we list this mutation with appropriate HGVS nomenclature.
