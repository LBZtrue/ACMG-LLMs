Okay, so I need to analyze the provided literature abstracts and extract information about genetic variants, diseases, experimental methods, etc., following the JSON template. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at the abstract, there are five mutations in DJ-1 protein associated with Parkinson's disease. The context mentions that these include L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A. From this, I can list out each variant.

For each variant, I need to find the HGVS nomenclature. Looking at the example response, it seems like they take the transcript number and position along with the change. But in the given abstract, only the protein changes are mentioned without specific transcripts or exact cDNA positions. For instance, L166P refers to a premature stop codon likely due to an alanine-to-p-created point mutation at position 166.

Wait, but the example response had HGVS like NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A. However, in our case, I don't have specific cDNA positions because the literature only mentions the protein changes without detailed cDNA info. So maybe for L166P, it's just a point mutation at position 166 leading to premature stop codon.

Next, the task is to standardize HGVS nomenclature via an API. But since I don't have access to APIs here, perhaps I can only write out what they would be if we had the tools. Maybe note that it's not possible without the necessary data.

Moving on, the disease studied is Parkinson's disease (PD), and from the context provided earlier in the user message, there are 11 genetic loci associated with PD. The MONDO term for PD would likely be its OMIM code or other identifiers. Let me check: usually, OMIM is NINELN, but I'm not entirely sure without looking it up.

Then, extracting experimental methods. The abstract mentions that they used solution-state NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy to evaluate structural perturbations. So these are the two techniques. But since the user provided a more detailed example with Western blot, I think in this case, we don't have further details on the methods beyond the ones mentioned.

I also need to determine if these experimental methods are approved for studying PD. NMR and circular dichroism are not typically classified as "approved assays" in the biomedical context; they're standard techniques but maybe not classified as such here. So perhaps the answer would be "N.D." or no, indicating that we don't have information on their approval status.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure to fill in N/A where specific data isn't available.

Here is the structured response based on the provided context and analysis:

Note: The HGVS nomenclature for each variant is described as "Point mutation at position 166 leading to premature stop codon..." without specific transcript details. The experimental methods are listed, but their approval status cannot be determined from the provided information.
