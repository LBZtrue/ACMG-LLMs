Based on the provided context and examples, here's a summary of the workflow to extract and organize information from the given literature into the specified JSON format:

1. Identify the gene(s) and variant(s) mentioned in the literature.
2. Extract the cDNA change (nucleotide change), protein change (amino acid change), position of the change, and a brief description of the variant's effect on the protein function from the literature.
3. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants using relevant APIs.
4. Identify the disease(s) studied in the literature.
5. Retrieve the corresponding MONDO term for the identified diseases.
6. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including:
   - Assay Method (Western Blot in this example)
   - Material Source (Cell line in this example)
   - Material Name (HEK293 in this example)
   - Readout type (Quantitative in this example)
   - Biological replicates (Yes, No, or N.D.) and description of their number or details from the literature
   - Technical replicates (Yes, No, or N.D.) and description of their number or details from the literature
   - Basic positive control (Yes, No, or N.D.), description of the positive control, and whether it is included in the experimental design
   - Basic negative control (Yes, No, or N.D.), description of the negative control, and whether it is included in the experimental design
   - Validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (Yes, No, or N.D.) and their number
   - Validation controls for benign/likely benign variants (Yes, No, or N.D.) and their number
   - Statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol
   - Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts, including their values and sources (Literature or Custom)
   - Whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease (Yes, No, or N.D.)
7. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

The output should be a JSON object following the provided example format, with updated details based on the specific literature being analyzed.
