Here's the workflow followed to generate the example provided:

1. Extracted the variant information from the literature: TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D) described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied was Hereditary Myopathy.

2. Standardized the HGVS nomenclature of the variant via relevant API to NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.

3. Identified the disease studied in the literature (Hereditary Myopathy) and retrieved the corresponding MONDO term (MONDO:0012345).

4. Listed the experimental method mentioned in the literature (Western Blot).

5. Extracted detailed information about the Western Blot method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

6. Organized the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

The resulting example is as follows:
