This structure can be used to systematically extract and organize information from the literature. The specific data points can then be filled in with the relevant details obtained from reading the literature. For example, if the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."
