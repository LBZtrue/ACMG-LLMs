Based on the provided context and examples, here is the workflow to follow for extracting and organizing data from the literature according to the specified JSON structure:

1. Read the literature and identify all relevant variants by noting down the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.

2. Use an API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the identified variants.

3. Find out the disease or condition studied in the literature and retrieve its corresponding MONDO term from the database.

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and gather detailed information about each method, including:
   - Material sources (cell lines, primary cells, etc.)
   - Readout types (qualitative/quantitative)
   - Result descriptions (including molecular effects of variants, conclusions, and specific details about each variant's experimental outcome)
   - Experimental replicates (biological and technical) and their respective counts
   - Control settings (basic positive control, basic negative control, validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, and validation controls for benign/likely benign variants)
   - Statistical analysis methods used
   - Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts, along with their sources
   - Whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease (Approved assay)

5. Organize the extracted and standardized data according to the predefined JSON framework as follows:
