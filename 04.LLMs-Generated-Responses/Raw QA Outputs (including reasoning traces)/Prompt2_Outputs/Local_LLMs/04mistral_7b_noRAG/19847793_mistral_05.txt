To extract and organize the information from the given literature, I will follow the workflow you've outlined. Here's an example based on the literature text provided:

- Example: Assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), and describes it as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."
