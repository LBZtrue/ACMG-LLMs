Based on the provided context and examples, I will generate a structure that follows the given JSON format for the analysis of the literature content. Here's an example:

Assume we have the following information from the literature:
- Gene: TP53
- Variant: c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."
- The study is about "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345"
- Experimental methods used: Western Blot and Mass Spectrometry (MS)

The output will be as follows:
