Based on the provided context and examples, here's a summary of the workflow to extract and organize information from the literature according to the predefined JSON structure:

1. Extract all relevant variant information including gene name, initial HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here's an example of how this information would be organized:
