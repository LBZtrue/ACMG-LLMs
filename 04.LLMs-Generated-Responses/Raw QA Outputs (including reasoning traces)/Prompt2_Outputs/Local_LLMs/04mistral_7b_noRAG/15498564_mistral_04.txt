Here is a step-by-step guide on how to extract and organize the information from the given literature:

1. Extract all relevant variant information, such as gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and any additional details about the effect of the variants on the protein. In this example, the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database. In this example, the disease is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, following the JSON framework provided.

   - Assay Method: Western Blot
   - Material Source: Cell line (HEK293)
   - Readout type: Quantitative
   - Result Description for each variant in the "Variants Include" section, including conclusion, molecular effect, and specific description of the experimental result.
   - Biological replicates: Number of biological replicates performed (e.g., 3)
   - Technical replicates: Number of technical replicates performed for each sample (e.g., triplicate)
   - Basic positive control: Description of whether a basic positive control was set up and, if so, details about the positive control used (e.g., wild-type cDNA)
   - Basic negative control: Description of whether a basic negative control was set up and, if so, details about the negative control used (e.g., empty vector)
   - Validation controls P/LP: Whether validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included, number of validation controls (e.g., 2)
   - Validation controls B/LB: Whether validation controls for benign/likely benign variants were included, number of validation controls (e.g., 1)
   - Statistical analysis method: Description of the statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol (e.g., ANOVA)
   - Threshold for normal readout and abnormal readout: Standards for normal and abnormal results, source of the threshold (e.g., Literature/Custom)
   - Approved assay: Whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease (e.g., Yes/No/N.D.)

Here's how the information would be organized according to the predefined JSON framework:
