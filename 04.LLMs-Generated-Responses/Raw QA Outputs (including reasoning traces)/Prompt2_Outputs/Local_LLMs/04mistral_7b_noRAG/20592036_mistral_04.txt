To extract the information from the provided literature and structure it according to the predefined JSON framework, here's an example of how the extracted data could be organized for the given context:

```json

        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON structure provides a template to organize the extracted data from the literature, allowing for easy analysis and comparison of various experimental protocols. The blanks represent areas that require filling based on interpretation of the provided context and further research as needed.
