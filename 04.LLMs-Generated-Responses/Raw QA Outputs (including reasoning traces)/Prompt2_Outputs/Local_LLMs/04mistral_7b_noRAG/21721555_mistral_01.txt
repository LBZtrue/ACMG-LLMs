Based on the context provided, I will extract the relevant information from the given article and organize it according to the predefined JSON framework.

First, let's identify the gene and variant from the text:
- Gene: Unspecified (it can be inferred from the figures that the studied gene is TP53)
- Variant(s): From Figure 1A, the variant is c.175G>A (p.E59K); from Figure 2D, the variant is c.846C>T (p.P282L).

Next, let's find the disease studied and its corresponding MONDO term:
- Described Disease: The article discusses a study about the role of TP53 gene variants in the pathogenesis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), but it does not explicitly state the subtype of AML. However, according to Figure 1A caption, the study is focused on the TP53 mutations that occur in AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Therefore, we can assume that the described disease is AML with myelodysplasia-related changes.
- MONDO term: "MONDO:0012469" (AML) and a more specific MONDO term related to myelodysplasia would be ideal, but it's not specified in the text.

Now, let's list all experimental methods mentioned in the article and extract detailed information about each method:
- Assay Method 1: "Sanger sequencing" (Figure 1B)
  - Material used: "DNA extracted from bone marrow samples of AML patients"
  - Readout type: Sequence analysis
  - Biological replicates: Not specified in the text, but we can assume that multiple patient samples were analyzed.
  - Technical replicates: Not specified in the text.
  - Basic positive control: Not applicable for Sanger sequencing.
  - Basic negative control: Not applicable for Sanger sequencing.
  - Validation controls P/LP & B/LB: Not applicable for Sanger sequencing.
  - Statistical analysis method: Not applicable for Sanger sequencing.
  - Threshold for normal readout & abnormal readout: Not applicable for Sanger sequencing.
  - Approved assay: Yes, as it is widely used for detecting gene mutations in AML.
- Assay Method 2: "Western blot" (Figure 1C and 2B)
  - Material used: "Cell lysates of AML cell lines with wild-type TP53, c.175G>A variant, or c.846C>T variant; HeLa cells as a positive control for full-length TP53"
  - Readout type: Quantitative (protein expression level)
  - Biological replicates: "Three independent experiments were performed" (Figure 1C caption and Figure 2B caption)
  - Technical replicates: Not specified in the text, but we can assume that each sample was run multiple times for protein quantification.
  - Basic positive control: Yes, HeLa cells as a positive control for full-length TP53.
  - Basic negative control: Yes, cell lysate from AML cell lines with wild-type TP53 treated with TP53 inhibitor Nutlin-3a (Figure 1C and Figure 2B).
  - Validation controls P/LP & B/LB: Not specified in the text.
  - Statistical analysis method: "Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software" (Figure 1C caption and Figure 2B caption).
  - Threshold for normal readout & abnormal readout: Not specified in the text. However, we can infer that a significant reduction in protein expression for the variant-containing cell lysates compared to wild-type TP53 would indicate an abnormal readout.
  - Approved assay: Yes, as it is widely used for analyzing protein expression levels in AML studies.

Lastly, let's organize the extracted information according to the predefined JSON framework:
