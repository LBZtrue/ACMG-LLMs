Based on the provided context and examples, here is a breakdown of how to analyze the given literature excerpts and organize the extracted information according to the defined JSON structure.

1. Extract all relevant variant information from the literature, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
   - For example: In the excerpt "c.248G>A (p.G83D)", the gene is TP53, the variant type is c.248G>A, the cDNA change is from G to A at position 248, and the protein change is from Glycine (G) to Aspartic acid (D) at position 83.

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
   - For example: Use a variant interpretation database like ClinVar or dbSNP to standardize the HGVS notation.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
   - For example: If the literature mentions "Hereditary Myopathy," use the MONDO database to find its ID, which would be MONDO:0012345.

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, following the provided JSON structure for each assay.
   - For example: If the literature mentions a Western Blot experiment, use the provided JSON structure to fill out the details like material sources (cell lines), readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease, which can be subjective based on the user's knowledge and expertise.
   - For example: If the literature mentions a Western Blot experiment for "Hereditary Myopathy," the user may determine that this is an approved assay for studying the disease, but it is essential to consider other possible experimental methods as well.
