1. Extract the relevant variant information from the provided literature context:
- Gene: TP53
- Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
- Disease: Hereditary Myopathy (MONDO:0012345)

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variant via relevant API.

3. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method:
- Assay Method: Western Blot
- Material Source: Cell line (HEK293)
- Readout type: Quantitative
- Biological replicates: Yes, Three biological replicates were performed.
- Technical replicates: Yes, Each sample was run in triplicate.
- Basic positive control: Yes, Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
- Basic negative control: Yes, Empty vector was used as a negative control.
- Validation controls P/LP: Yes, 2 validation controls were included.
- Validation controls B/LB: Yes, 1 validation control was included.
- Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
- Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 (Literature)
- Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7 (Literature)
- Approved assay: Yes

4. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.
