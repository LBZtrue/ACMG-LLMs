Based on the provided context and example, here's a summary of the workflow to create the JSON output for a given literature excerpt:

1. Identify the gene, variant (cDNA change and protein change), and any additional information about the variant from the literature.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature using a relevant API if necessary.
3. Determine the disease described in the literature and find its corresponding MONDO term.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature, then extract detailed information for each method as follows:
   - Assay Method: The name of the assay or method used in the experiment.
   - Material used:
     - Material Source: Where the material comes from (e.g., Cell line).
     - Material Name: The specific type of material used (e.g., HEK293).
     - Description: Any additional information about the material or its use in the experiment.
   - Readout type: Whether the assay is qualitative or quantitative.
   - Readout description:
     - Variant: The HGVS nomenclature of the variant being studied.
     - Conclusion: Whether the experimental result was normal, abnormal, or neither (e.g., no effect).
     - Molecular Effect: The molecular effect of the variant on the gene product, such as complete loss-of-function, partial loss-of-function, gain-of-function, dominant-negative, or no effect.
     - Result Description: A specific description of the experimental result for the given variant.
   - Biological replicates: Whether biological replicate experiments were performed, and any additional information about them.
   - Technical replicates: Whether technical replicate experiments were performed, and any additional information about them.
   - Basic positive control: Whether a basic positive control was set up, its description, and any other relevant information.
   - Basic negative control: Whether a basic negative control was set up, its description, and any other relevant information.
   - Validation controls P/LP: Information about validation controls for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (if applicable).
   - Validation controls B/LB: Information about validation controls for benign or likely benign variants (if applicable).
   - Statistical analysis method: The statistical analysis method used in the experimental protocol.
   - Threshold for normal readout: The threshold for a normal result, its source, and any additional information if available.
   - Threshold for abnormal readout: The threshold for an abnormal result, its source, and any additional information if available.
   - Approved assay: Whether the experimental protocol used in the literature is generally used for studying this disease (Yes/No/N.D.).

The final step would be to organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework. The output should resemble the example provided earlier.
