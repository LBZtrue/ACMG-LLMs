Based on the provided context and examples, I will outline a Python script to extract, process, and organize the required data from the given literature in a format compatible with your predefined JSON structure. Please note that this is a basic script and might need adjustments depending on the actual structure of the literature you are working with.

```python
import re

def process_literature(input_lit):
    # Extract relevant information from the given literature
    variant = re.findall(r'\b(\w+:\w+>\w+)\s*(\((.*)\))', input_lit)
    disease = ''  # Find and extract the disease name from the literature
    moono_term = ''  # Find and extract the MOONO term from a database or API

    assay = []  # Initialize an empty list for the experiment methods

    # Assuming the literature is structured as follows:
    if 'Western Blot' in input_lit:
        sub_lit = re.split('Western Blot', input_lit, 1)
        sub_lit = sub_lit[1]  # Take the second part of the string (after Western Blot)

        # Extract information about the assay method
        assay.append({
            'Assay Method': 'Western Blot',
            # ... continue to extract other details as per your JSON structure
        })

    for item in assay:
        # Assuming each experiment method has a unique description of variants
        item['Readout description'] = []
        for line in sub_lit.split('\n'):
            if 'c.' in line and 'p.' in line:
                variant_info = re.findall(r'(\w+:\w+>\w+)\s*(\((.*)\))', line)
                # Add each variant to the experiment method
                item['Readout description'].append({
                    'Variant': variant_info[0][0],
                    # ... continue to extract other details as per your JSON structure
                })

    # Organize the extracted and processed data according to the JSON framework
    output = {
        'Variants Include': [{'Gene': '', 'variants': [{'HGVS': variant[0], 'cDNA Change': {'transcript': '', 'ref': '', 'alt': '', 'position': ''}, 'Protein Change': {'ref': '', 'alt': '', 'position': ''}, 'Description in input context': ''} for variant in variant] }],
        'Described Disease': {'Described Disease': disease, 'MONDO': moono_term },
        'Experiment Method': assay
    }
    return output
```

This script defines a function `process_literature()`, which takes the given literature as input and extracts relevant information from it. The function then organizes the extracted data according to your predefined JSON structure. You can call this function with the appropriate literature string as its argument to get the desired output.
