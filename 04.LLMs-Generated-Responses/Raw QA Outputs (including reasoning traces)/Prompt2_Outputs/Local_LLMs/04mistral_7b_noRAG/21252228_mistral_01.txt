I have parsed the provided context and workflow to generate an organized JSON structure for summarizing the content of a scientific literature piece regarding genetic variants and their experimental analysis. Below is an example based on the given context, assuming the literature discusses a variant in the TP53 gene (c.248G>A, p.G83D) related to Hereditary Myopathy:
