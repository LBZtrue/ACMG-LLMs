Here is the workflow for extracting and organizing the information according to the given JSON structure, based on Example 1 provided:

1. Read the literature and identify the gene name (TP53) and preliminary HGVS nomenclature (c.248G>A).
2. Standardize the preliminary HGVS nomenclature via relevant API to get the final HGVS. In this case, since no further information is given, we will assume the standardized HGVS remains as c.248G>A.
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature (Hereditary Myopathy) and retrieve the corresponding MONDO term (MONDO:0012345).
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results. In this case, assume the experiment uses a Western Blot assay:

    - Material used:
      * Material Source: Cell line
      * Material Name: HEK293
      * Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
    - Readout type: Quantitative
    - Readout description:
        * Variant: c.248G>A (since no further information is given, we will assume this variant causes an abnormal molecular effect)
        * Conclusion: Abnormal
        * Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function (this can be inferred from the literature description that the variant causes a structural change in the protein affecting its function)
        * Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant c.248G>A.
    - Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
    - Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
    - Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
    - Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control.
    - Validation controls P/LP: Yes, two validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included.
    - Validation controls B/LB: Yes, one validation control for benign/likely benign variants was included.
    - Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
    - Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 (since not described in the literature, assume a standard threshold based on your knowledge).
    - Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7 (since not described in the literature, assume a standard threshold based on your knowledge).
    - Approved assay: Yes (assume that Western Blot is generally used for studying Hereditary Myopathy)

5. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
