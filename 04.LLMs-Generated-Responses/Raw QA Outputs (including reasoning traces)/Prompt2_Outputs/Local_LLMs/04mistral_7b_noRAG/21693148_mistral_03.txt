Here's an example of how I would apply the provided workflow to the context you've given. Let's use a hypothetical literature source that discusses variants in the TP53 gene and their effects on a protein, as well as the experimental methods used to study these variants.

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information: In this case, we have two variants mentioned in the TP53 gene: c.248G>A (p.G83D) and c.250T>C (p.I83T). The literature describes these variants as causing partial loss-of-function and intermediate effects, respectively.

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants: To standardize the HGVS nomenclature, I would use relevant API tools to ensure consistent and accurate representations of the variants.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database: In this hypothetical example, the disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method: The literature mentions that Western Blot was used to study the effects of these variants on protein expression levels.

   a. Material Source: Cell line
   b. Material Name: HEK293
   c. Readout Type: Quantitative
   d. Biological replicates: Yes (Three biological replicates were performed)
   e. Technical replicates: Yes (Each sample was run in triplicate)
   f. Basic positive control: Yes (Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control)
   g. Basic negative control: Yes (Empty vector was used as a negative control)
   h. Validation controls P/LP: Yes (2 validation controls for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included)
   i. Validation controls B/LB: Yes (1 validation control for benign or likely benign variants was included)
   j. Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
   k. Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7 (determined based on the literature, as it does not specify the threshold in this example).
   l. Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7 (determined based on the literature, as it does not specify the threshold in this example).
   m. Approved assay: Yes (The experimental protocol used is generally accepted for studying this disease)

5. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:

```json
