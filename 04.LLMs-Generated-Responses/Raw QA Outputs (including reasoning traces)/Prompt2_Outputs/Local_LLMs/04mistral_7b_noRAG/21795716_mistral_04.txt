Based on the provided context and workflow, I will now analyze the literature snippet you have given to generate the desired JSON output. Let's take the following literature as an example:

Literature: "A study was performed on a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), which affects protein function and is associated with hereditary cancers."

JSON Output:
