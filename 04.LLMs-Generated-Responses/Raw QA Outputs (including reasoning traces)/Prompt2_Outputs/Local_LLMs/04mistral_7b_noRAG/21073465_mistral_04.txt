Here is the information extracted from the given context, organized according to the predefined JSON framework:

```json

    "Variants Include": [
        {

                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",

                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "Not provided in the context" // You would need to search for this term in a database or similar resource.
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            // The rest of the information would need to be inferred from the context or supplemented with information not provided.
        }
    ]
}
```

Since some information is missing, I cannot fill out all the fields for "Experiment Method". You will have to infer the rest based on your knowledge and the available context.
