Here's an example of how I would process the literature according to the provided workflow and format:

Assume we have the following literature:

1. The study describes a variant in the BRCA1 gene, c.4096C>T (p.R1366W), described as "This variant has been reported to be likely pathogenic." The disease studied is "Familial Breast Cancer," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0006278."

According to the workflow and provided format, the output would look like this:
