Based on the provided context and examples, here's a breakdown of the workflow for generating the required JSON output from a given literature:

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
   - In this case, you have extracted:
     - Gene: TP53
     - Preliminary HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
   - Since this step requires API usage, you can replace the preliminary HGVS with the standardized one obtained from the API response.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
   - In this case, you have identified:
     - Described Disease: Hereditary Myopathy
     - MONDO: "MONDO:0012345" (assuming it has been retrieved from the MONDO database)

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
   - Assuming you have found:
     - Assay Method: Western Blot
     - Material Source: Cell line (HEK293)
     - Readout type: Quantitative
     - Result description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
     - Biological replicates: Yes (Three biological replicates were performed.)
     - Technical replicates: Yes (Each sample was run in triplicate.)
     - Basic positive control: Yes (Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.)
     - Basic negative control: Yes (Empty vector was used as a negative control.)
     - Validation controls P/LP: Yes (2 validation controls were included.)
     - Validation controls B/LB: Yes (1 validation control was included.)
     - Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
     - Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7. (Literature)
     - Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7. (Literature)
     - Approved assay: Yes (Assuming this method is generally used for studying the disease)

5. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.
   - Here's the final JSON output:
