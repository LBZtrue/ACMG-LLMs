Based on the provided context and JSON structure, here's a breakdown of the answer for the literature excerpt you've provided:

1. Variant extraction: The variant in the TP53 gene is c.248G>A (p.G83D). This variant causes a structural change in the protein and affects its function.

2. HGVS nomenclature standardization: Using the relevant API, we can standardize the HGVS nomenclature as follows: "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.Gly83Asp)".

3. Disease identification and MONDO term retrieval: The disease studied in the literature is "Hereditary Myopathy." The corresponding MONDO term can be retrieved as "MONDO:0012345."

4. Experiment method extraction: From the literature, we learn that a Western Blot assay was used to examine the variant's effect on protein expression.

5. Organize and fill in the JSON structure:
