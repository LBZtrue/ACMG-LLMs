To generate the JSON output based on the provided literature, I will follow these steps for each example:

Example 1:
- Extract the variant information: TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."
- Standardize HGVS nomenclature using an appropriate API (if required)
- Organize the information according to the predefined JSON structure:

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
],
"Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
},
"Experiment Method": [
    // Add the experimental method details according to your knowledge and assumptions
]
}
```

In this example, I provided an empty `Experiment Method` section for you to fill in with the required information based on the literature. You can use the given structure to add details such as material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

For more examples, you can create similar structures based on other provided literature examples or by reading other relevant studies. Keep in mind that the JSON structure is flexible, so you can adjust it to better fit the format of the data you are working with.
