Based on the provided context and examples, here's a breakdown of the steps to follow for a new literature excerpt:

1. Identify the gene, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes mentioned in the literature. For example, if the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene (c.248G>A, p.G83D), we have:
   - Gene: TP53
   - HGVS (initial): c.248G>A
   - cDNA Change: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
   - Protein Change: p.G83D

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variant(s) using a relevant API, if necessary.

3. Determine the disease studied in the literature by reading it carefully or referring to the title and/or abstract, and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database. For example, if the disease discussed in the literature is "Hereditary Myopathy," the MONDO term could be "MONDO:0012345."

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method following the predefined JSON framework. For example:

```json
"Experiment Method": [
    {
        // Assay details, including type, material sources, readout types, result descriptions, etc.
        // Fill out based on the information provided in the literature.
    }
]
```

5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease by consulting relevant resources (e.g., scientific literature, guidelines) or experts in the field, if necessary.

6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework. For example:

```json
{
    // Variants, Disease, and Experiment Method details as described earlier
}
```

By following these steps, you can efficiently analyze a literature excerpt and structure the results in the desired JSON format.
