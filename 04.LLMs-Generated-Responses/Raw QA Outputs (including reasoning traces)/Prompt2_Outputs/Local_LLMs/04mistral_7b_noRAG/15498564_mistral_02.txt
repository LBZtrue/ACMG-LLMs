1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API. (Since I am a text-based AI model, I don't have the ability to execute APIs but can help you write the code for it)
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here's an example:

Assume we have the following literature excerpt:

```
The study investigated a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), which was found to cause structural changes in the protein and affect its function. The research focused on Hereditary Myopathy, a genetic disorder. The authors performed Western blot analysis to evaluate the effects of this variant on protein expression.
```

The JSON output for this example would be:
