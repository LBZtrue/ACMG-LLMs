Based on the provided context, workflow, and examples, here is a summary of my task:

1. Given a piece of literature that discusses variants in a specific gene and their associated experimental protocols, extract all relevant information about the variants, such as the gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and any related descriptions.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants using a relevant API.
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature, and for each method, extract detailed information about the material sources, readout types, result descriptions (including conclusions, molecular effects, and specific results), experimental replicates (biological and technical), control settings, statistical analysis methods, thresholds for normal and abnormal results, and whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying the identified disease.
5. Organize the extracted information according to a predefined JSON structure.

Here's an example of how the output might look for a given piece of literature:
