To generate an answer using the provided workflow and examples, let's take the literature from one of the contexts you provided: "Trp53 mutant mice exhibit increased tumor susceptibility." We will extract relevant information and organize it according to the JSON framework.

  1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information: In this case, we don't have specific variants mentioned in the literature; instead, we are focusing on Trp53 (the gene) and its functional impact in mice.

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API: Since there are no specific variants mentioned, this step is not required for this example.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database: The disease studied is "Tumor Susceptibility." I'm unable to access external databases, but you can find the corresponding MONDO term by searching online.

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method: In this example, we have one main experimental method (Trp53 mutant mice), so let's assume it was performed using genetically modified mice.

5. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
