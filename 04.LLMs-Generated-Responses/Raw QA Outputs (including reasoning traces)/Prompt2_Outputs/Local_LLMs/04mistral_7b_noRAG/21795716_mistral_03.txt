To extract and organize the information from the provided literature, I will follow the workflow as outlined in the context:

1. Read the literature and identify the gene with the variant, c.248G>A (p.G83D). The gene is TP53.

2. Identify the disease studied in the literature, which appears to be "Hereditary Myopathy."

3. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variant using a relevant API. In this example, I will not perform the standardization because it's not specified how to do it in the given context.

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method:

   - The literature mentions the Western Blot assay as the experimental method used.

5. Extract detailed information about the Western Blot assay, according to the predefined JSON framework:
