Based on the provided context and workflow, I will create a program that takes in a literature text as input and returns a JSON object as output. The output will contain all relevant information about the variants found in the text, the disease studied, and details of each experimental method mentioned in the text.

Here's an example of what the Python code might look like:

```python
import re
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def standardize_hgvs(hgvs):
    # Call to API for HGVS standardization (to be implemented)
    pass

def get_mondo_term(disease):
    # Call to API or database for MONDO term lookup (to be implemented)
    pass

def parse_experimental_method(text):
    match = re.search(r'Assay Method: (.*?)\nMaterial used:\s*(.*?)\nReadout type: (.*?)\n', text)
    if match:
        assay, material, readout_type = match.groups()
        # Continue parsing the rest of the method details...

def parse_readout(text):
    # Parse the readout description from the experimental method text
    pass

def main(literature_text):
    # Initialize empty JSON object
    output = {}

    # Extract all variants and their information from the literature text
    variants = extract_variants(literature_text)

    # Standardize HGVS nomenclature for each variant
    standardized_variants = [standardize_hgvs(variant['hgvs']) for variant in variants]

    # Identify the disease studied and get its MONDO term
    disease, mondo_term = identify_disease(literature_text)

    # Parse each experimental method mentioned in the literature text
    methods = []
    for match in re.finditer(r'Assay Method: (.*?)\nMaterial used:\s*(.*?)\n', literature_text, re.DOTALL):
        methods.append(parse_experimental_method(match.group(0)))

    # Organize the parsed information according to the JSON framework
    output = {
        'Variants Include': standardized_variants,
        'Described Disease': {'Described Disease': disease, 'MONDO': mondo_term},
        'Experiment Method': methods
    }

    return output
```
