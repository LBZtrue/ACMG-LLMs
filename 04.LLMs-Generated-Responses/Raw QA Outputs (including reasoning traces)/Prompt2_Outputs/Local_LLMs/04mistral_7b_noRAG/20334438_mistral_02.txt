To provide an answer based on the literature provided, let's assume that we have a study which investigates the impact of two variants in the P53 gene (TP53) on protein expression and function. The study describes these variants as c.175G>A (p.E59K) and c.248G>A (p.G83D).

   Here's how the information might be structured according to your JSON framework:

In this example, we have two variants c.175G>A (p.E59K) and c.248G>A (p.G83D) in the P53 gene, and we've conducted Western Blot experiments to investigate their impact on protein expression. The results show that both variants have an effect on protein expression, with variant c.175G>A having a partial loss-of-function and variant c.248G>A having a complete loss-of-function. The study uses the approved assay of Western Blot for investigating the effects of these variants on Hereditary Myopathy.
