Based on your provided context and examples, I will outline the steps to follow for extracting and organizing the information from a given literature piece using the specified JSON structure. Here is a simplified workflow with an example for clarity:

1. Read the literature and identify all relevant variant information, such as gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
   - Example: Assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API (This step may not be necessary if you are provided with a standardized nomenclature).

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database if they are available, or manually record the disease name.

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, using the predefined JSON framework for organization:
   - Example:
     {
       "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
       "Material used": {
         "Material Source": "Cell line",
         "Material Name": "HEK293",
         "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
       },
       //... (continue with the rest of the fields as specified in your JSON structure)
     }

5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease based on your own knowledge or additional research.

6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework, and populate it with the relevant details from each experimental method mentioned in the literature.

7. If required, repeat steps 4-6 for any other methods described in the literature, and aggregate all results under the "Experiment Method" section of the final JSON output.

This workflow ensures that you have a structured format to present your findings, making it easy to compare and contrast various experimental approaches and their outcomes across different studies.
