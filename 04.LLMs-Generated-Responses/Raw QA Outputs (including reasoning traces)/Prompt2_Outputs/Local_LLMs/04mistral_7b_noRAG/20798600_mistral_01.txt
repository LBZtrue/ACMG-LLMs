1. Extract the relevant information from each of the provided literature contexts, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API (if necessary).
3. Identify the disease studied in each literature context and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in each literature context and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the diseases mentioned in the literature contexts.
6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Example 1:
Assume the first literature context mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."
