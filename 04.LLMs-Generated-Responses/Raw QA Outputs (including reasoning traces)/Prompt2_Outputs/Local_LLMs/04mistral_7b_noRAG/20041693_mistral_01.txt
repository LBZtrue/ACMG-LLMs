Here's how I would approach this task based on the provided context and example:

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API (In this case, I would standardize the provided 'NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A' using a tool like `Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)` or similar API to ensure accurate and consistent nomenclature).
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database (In this case, since the provided example mentions "Hereditary Myopathy," I would search for the corresponding MONDO term).
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results (In this case, I would follow the provided structure in the example to organize the extracted information).
5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease (In this case, since the provided example mentions "Western Blot" as an approved assay for studying Hereditary Myopathy, I would confirm that this method is indeed commonly used for the given disease).
6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

The final output will be a well-structured JSON object containing the extracted and processed data. Keep in mind that my ability to execute this task depends on the quality and availability of the provided literature, as well as access to external APIs for HGVS standardization and disease term retrieval.
