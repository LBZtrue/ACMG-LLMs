Here's an example based on the literature you provided:

Assume the literature mentions variants in two genes, c.1234_1240del (p.(Ala411_Glu412del)) and c.5678G>A (p.(Glu1908Lys)), described as "These variants are associated with a gain-of-function in the protein." The disease studied is "Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0002345."
