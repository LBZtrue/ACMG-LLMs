To perform the task based on the provided workflow and examples, here's a summary of how to approach each step:

1. Extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes from the literature. In this case:
   - Gene: TP53
   - Variant: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API if necessary, as the provided variant appears to be in a standard format.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database:
   - Described Disease: Hereditary Myopathy
   - MONDO term: "MONDO:0012345" (This should be obtained from a reliable source, such as the MonDO database)

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method:
   - Assay Method: Western Blot
   - Material used:
     - Material Source: Cell line
     - Material Name: HEK293
     - Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
   - Readout type: Quantitative
   - Readout description (for each variant):
     - Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
     - Conclusion: Abnormal
     - Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
     - Result Description: Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
   - Biological replicates: Yes (Three biological replicates were performed)
   - Technical replicates: Yes (Each sample was run in triplicate)
   - Basic positive control: Yes (Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control)
   - Basic negative control: Yes (Empty vector was used as a negative control)
   - Validation controls P/LP: Yes (2 validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included)
   - Validation controls B/LB: Yes (1 validation control for benign/likely benign variants was included)
   - Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
   - Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7. (If not described in the literature, determine the standard for normal results based on your own knowledge)
   - Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7. (If not described in the literature, determine the standard for abnormal results based on your own knowledge)
   - Approved assay: Yes

5. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.
