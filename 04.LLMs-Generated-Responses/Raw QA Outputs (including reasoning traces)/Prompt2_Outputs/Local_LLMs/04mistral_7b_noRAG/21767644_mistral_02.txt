To provide an answer in the format you specified, I will demonstrate the workflow using one of the provided literature references as an example. Here is how the JSON structure could look for the study "Context: Context: The article 'Therapeutic Strategies for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Current Status and Future Directions' describes various genetic mutations in DMD."
