To perform the task based on your provided workflow and example, I would follow these steps:

1. Read through the literature to identify all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, protein changes, and any additional context about the variants (e.g., their effect on the protein). In your example, a variant in the TP53 gene is mentioned: c.248G>A (p.G83D) and described as causing a structural change that affects the protein's function.

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants using relevant APIs, if necessary. In this case, since you provided the preliminary HGVS nomenclature, no standardization is required.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature by reading through it and searching for mentions of specific diseases. Then, retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database. Since the described disease is "Hereditary Myopathy," the MONDO term would be "MONDO:0012345."

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature by identifying them through keywords (e.g., "Western Blot" in your example). Once identified, extract detailed information about each method as per the JSON structure you provided. This includes material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.

5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease based on your knowledge or additional research. Since you did not specify a method in your example, this step would not apply here.

6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework that you provided. This will create the final output following the structure defined in the examples you have given.
