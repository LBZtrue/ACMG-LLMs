You'll need to replace the placeholders with the appropriate values from the literature:

* `<standardized_HGVS_nomenclature>`: standardized HGVS nomenclature for the variant (from the API)
* `<disease_name>`: name of the disease studied in the literature
* `<MONDO_term>`: MONDO term for the disease
* `<assay_method>`: assay method mentioned in the literature
* `<material_source>`, `<material_name>`, and `<description>`: details about the material used in the experiment from the literature
* `<readout_type>`: readout type specified in the literature (e.g., Quantitative)
* `<variant_HGVS>`: HGVS nomenclature for the variant (from the standardized nomenclature)
* `<conclusion>`, `<molecular_effect>`, and `<result_description>`: details about the experimental results from the literature
* `<number_of_biological_replicates>`, `<number_of_technical_replicates>`: number of biological and technical replicates performed (from the literature)
* `<presence_or_absence>`: whether a positive or negative control was used (from the literature)
* `<statistical_analysis_method>`: statistical analysis method specified in the literature
* `<threshold_for_normal>`, `<source>`: threshold for normal readout and source of the threshold (determine this from the literature or use your own knowledge if not provided in the literature)
* `<threshold_for_abnormal>`, `<source>`: threshold for abnormal readout and source of the threshold (determine this from the literature or use your own knowledge if not provided in the literature)
* `<approval_status>`: whether the experimental protocol is generally used for studying this disease (Yes/No/N.D.)
