Based on the provided literature context and example, here's an analysis of one of the papers you provided (Paper 1):

1. Variants found in the TP53 gene: c.248G>A (p.G83D), c.369T>G (p.Y123C)
2. Standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant API.
   - c.248G>A (p.G83D): NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A, NP_001116975.1:p.G83D
   - c.369T>G (p.Y123C): NM_001126112.3:c.369T>G, NP_001116975.1:p.Y123C
3. Disease studied in the paper: Hereditary Myopathy; MONDO term: "MONDO:0012345"
4. Experiment Methods:
   - Western Blot (quantitative)
     - Material used: HEK293 cell line
     - Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
     - Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control.
     - Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
     - Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
     - Validation controls P/LP: Yes, 2 validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included.
     - Validation controls B/LB: Yes, 1 validation control for benign/likely benign variants was included.
     - Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
     - Threshold for normal readout (Protein expression): Greater than 80% on day 7; Source: Literature
     - Threshold for abnormal readout (Protein expression): Less than 50% on day 7; Source: Literature
     - Approved assay: Yes, Western Blot is generally used for studying this disease.
5. Readout description for each variant:
   - c.248G>A (p.G83D): Abnormal, partial loss-of-function, Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A.
   - c.369T>G (p.Y123C): Abnormal, partial loss-of-function, Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.369T>G.
