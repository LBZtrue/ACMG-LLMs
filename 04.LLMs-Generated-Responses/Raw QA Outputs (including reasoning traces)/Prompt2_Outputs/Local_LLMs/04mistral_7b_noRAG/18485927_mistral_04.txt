Based on the provided context, here is the workflow and examples for the task.

Workflow:
1. Extract all relevant information from the literature, such as gene name, variant details, cDNA changes, protein changes, experimental methods, material sources, readout types, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
2. Standardize HGVS nomenclature of the variants using relevant APIs.
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
4. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Examples:

Example 1:
- Literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."
