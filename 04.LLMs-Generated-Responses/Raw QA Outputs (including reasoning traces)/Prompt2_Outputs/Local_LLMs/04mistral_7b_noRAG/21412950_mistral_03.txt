Based on the provided context and examples, I have created a Python function that takes a string containing the literature description as an argument and returns the structured JSON data according to your specifications. Here's the Python function:

```python
import re

def parse_literature(lit_description):
    # Function to extract information from the literature

    lit_dict = {}

    # Extract variants and associated data
    variant_pattern = r"(\w+) (\w+)\s*(\([^)]*\))\s*(.*)"  # Example: TP53 G83D causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function.
    matches = re.findall(variant_pattern, lit_description)
    variants = []
    for match in matches:
        gene, codon_change, protein_change, description = match
        # Preliminary HGVS nomenclature
        transcript, ref, alt, position = codon_change[1:-1].split(" ")
        variant = f"{transcript}:c.{position}{ref}>{alt}"
        variants.append({
            "gene": gene,
            "description": description,
            "variant": variant,
            # Complete HGVS nomenclature (to be filled)
        })

    lit_dict["Variants Include"] = variants

    # Extract disease information
    disease_pattern = r"The study was conducted on (\w+)"  # Example: The study was conducted on Hereditary Myopathy.
    match = re.search(disease_pattern, lit_description)
    if match:
        lit_dict["Described Disease"] = {"Described Disease": match.group(1), "MONDO": f"MONDO:{get_mondo_term(match.group(1))}"}  # Placeholder function to get the MONDO term (to be implemented)

    # Extract experiment method information
    experiment_pattern = r"The experiment was conducted using ([^\.]+)"  # Example: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
    match = re.search(experiment_pattern, lit_description)
    if match:
        exp_method = {"Assay Method": match.group(1)}
        # Fill in the rest of the experiment method data (to be filled)
        lit_dict["Experiment Method"].append(exp_method)

    return lit_dict
```

This function is a starting point, and further work will need to be done to fill in the missing parts, such as completing the HGVS nomenclature, implementing the `get_mondo_term()` function, and filling out the rest of the experimental method data. However, this should provide a good foundation for building the Python script.
