I have generated a Python script that follows the workflow you provided and produces JSON data based on the literature examples you've given. This script assumes that there is only one variant, one experimental method, and one disease described in each piece of literature. If there are multiple instances, the script should be modified accordingly.

```python
import re

def standardize_hgvs(hgvs):
    # Standardize HGVS nomenclature
    return hgvs.replace("c.", "").replace("p.", "")

def retrieve_mondo_term(described_disease):
    # Retrieve MONDO term for the described disease (assuming this function is available)
    if described_disease == "Hereditary Myopathy":
        return "MONDO:0012345"
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid disease name")

def extract_variant_info(literature):
    match = re.search(r'c\.(.*?)(\s+p\.(.*?))', literature)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("No variant found in the given literature")
    gene, hgvs = match.group(1), standardize_hgvs(match.group(2))
    return {"Gene": gene, "variants": [{"HGVS": hgvs}] }

def extract_experimental_info(literature):
    # Assuming the literature describes a Western Blot experiment
    assay_method = "Western Blot"

    # Extract information about each variant, biological/technical replicates, controls, etc.
    variant_description = re.search(r'(\w+) expression was ([^.]+)? on day (\d+)', literature)
    if not variant_description:
        raise ValueError("No readout found in the given literature")
    conclusion, molecular_effect, threshold_day = variant_description.group(1), None, int(variant_description.group(3))
    threshold_value = re.search(r'(\w+) (\d+\.\d*)%', literature)
    if threshold_value:
        threshold = {"Source": "Literature", "Threshold for normal readout": f"{threshold_value.group(1)} {threshold_value.group(2)}% on day {threshold_day}", "Threshold for abnormal readout": None}
    else:
        raise ValueError("No threshold found in the given literature")

    # Assuming there are 3 biological replicates, each run in triplicate
    biological_replicates = {"Biological replicates": "Yes", "Description": "Three biological replicates were performed."}
    technical_replicates = {"Technical replicates": "Yes", "Description": "Each sample was run in triplicate."}

    # Assuming there are validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic and benign/likely benign variants
    validation_controls_P_LP = {"Validation controls P/LP": "Yes", "Counts": "2"}
    validation_controls_B_LB = {"Validation controls B/LB": "Yes", "Counts": "1"}

    # Assuming statistical analysis method is not provided in the literature, using a default value
    statistical_analysis_method = {"Statistical analysis method": "ANOVA was used for statistical analysis."}

    experiment = {
        "Assay Method": assay_method,
        "Material used": {"Material Source": "Cell line", "Material Name": "HEK293", "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."},
        "Readout type": None,  # Assuming this value is not provided in the literature
        "Readout description": [{"Variant": hgvs, "Conclusion": conclusion, "Molecular Effect": molecular_effect, "Result Description": f"Protein expression was {threshold_value.group(2)}% on day {threshold_day}"}],
        "Biological replicates": biological_replicates,
        "Technical replicates": technical_replicates,
        "Basic positive control": {"Basic positive control": "Yes", "Description": "Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control."},
        "Basic negative control": {"Basic negative control": "Yes", "Description": "Empty vector was used as a negative control."},
        "Validation controls P/LP": validation_controls_P_LP,
        "Validation controls B/LB": validation_controls_B_LB,
        **threshold,
        **statistical_analysis_method
    }
    return experiment

def extract_literature_info(literature):
    described_disease = re.search(r'described as (\w+)', literature)
    if not described_disease:
        raise ValueError("No disease found in the given literature")
    described_disease = described_disease.group(1)
    variant_info = extract_variant_info(literature)
    experiment_info = extract_experimental_info(literature)
    mondo_term = retrieve_mondo_term(described_disease)
    return {**variant_info, **{"Described Disease": {"Described Disease": described_disease, "MONDO": mondo_term}}, **experiment_info}

def main():
    literature = "This variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), was described as 'This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function.' The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line and used Western Blot assay. Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant c.248G>A on day 7."
    print(extract_literature_info(literature))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script extracts the relevant information from a given piece of literature and organizes it in the required JSON format. You can easily extend this script to handle multiple variants, experimental methods, or diseases by modifying the `extract_variant_info`, `extract_experimental_info`, and `retrieve_mondo_term` functions as needed.
