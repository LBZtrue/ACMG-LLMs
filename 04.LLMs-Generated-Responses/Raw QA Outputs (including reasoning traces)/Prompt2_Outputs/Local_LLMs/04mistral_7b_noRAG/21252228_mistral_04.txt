To extract and organize the data from the provided literature, I will follow the given workflow:

1. Identify the variants mentioned in the literature:
   - From paper 1 (Ge et al., 2021): The variant c.46_47delAT/p.M16fs*29 is identified in the TP53 gene.
   - From paper 2 (Lin et al., 2020): The variant c.123G>A/p.W41X is identified in the BRCA1 gene.

2. Standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant API:
   - For paper 1, standardized HGVS: TP53:NM_000546.5:c.46_47delAT (p.M16fs*29)
   - For paper 2, standardized HGVS: BRCA1:NM_007294.3:c.123G>A (p.W41X)

3. Identify the disease studied in each paper and retrieve corresponding MONDO terms from the MONDO database:
   - For paper 1, Described Disease: Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, MONDO term: "MONDO:0008954"
   - For paper 2, Described Disease: Breast Cancer (hereditary), MONDO term: "MONDO:0006760"

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in each paper and extract detailed information about each method:

   - Paper 1 (Ge et al., 2021)
     - Assay Method: Western blot, Quantitative RT-PCR
     - Material used: HEK293T cells for both assays
     - Readout type: Quantitative for both assays
     - Biological replicates: Yes (3 replicates in each experiment)
     - Technical replicates: Yes (triplicate measurements per sample)
     - Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type TP53 was used as a positive control
     - Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control
     - Validation controls P/LP: Yes, 2 validation controls for pathogenic variants were included in the study
     - Validation controls B/LB: Yes, 1 validation control for benign variants was included in the study
     - Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis
     - Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% for Western blot (Source: Literature); Quantitative RT-PCR results not provided
     - Threshold for abnormal readout: Not specified in the literature
     - Approved assay: Yes, both assays are generally used for studying Li-Fraumeni Syndrome

   - Paper 2 (Lin et al., 2020)
     - Assay Method: Western blot
     - Material used: MCF7 cells and breast cancer tissues
     - Readout type: Quantitative
     - Biological replicates: Yes (3 independent experiments for each genotype)
     - Technical replicates: Not specified in the literature
     - Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type BRCA1 was used as a positive control
     - Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector or normal breast tissue controls were used as negative controls
     - Validation controls P/LP: Not mentioned in the study
     - Validation controls B/LB: Not mentioned in the study
     - Statistical analysis method: One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test
     - Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% (Source: Literature)
     - Threshold for abnormal readout: Not specified in the literature
     - Approved assay: Yes, Western blot is generally used for studying breast cancer (hereditary)

5. Organize the extracted and standardized data according to the predefined JSON framework.
