Based on the provided workflow and example, I will create a function that takes in the literature text as input and returns the output in the specified JSON format. The function will perform the following steps:

1. Extract all relevant variant information from the literature text, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API. (This step requires an additional function to perform the standardization.)
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database. (This requires access to a database or API for the MONDO terms.)
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, as per the provided JSON format.
5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease (this may require additional research or knowledge).
6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here is a Python function that implements these steps:

```python
import requests

def extract_experiment_info(literature):
    # Extract variant, disease, and experimental information from the literature text
    # ... (This requires parsing the literature text, which can be done using regular expressions, NLP techniques, or other methods.)

    variant = "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A"  # Placeholder for extracted variant
    gene = "TP53"  # Placeholder for extracted gene name
    disease = "Hereditary Myopathy"  # Placeholder for identified disease
    assay_approved = True  # Placeholder for whether the experimental protocol is approved for studying the disease

    # Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants (Requires an additional function to perform standardization)
    variant = standardize_hgvs(variant)

    # Retrieve the MONDO term for the identified disease
    mondo_term = get_mondo_term(disease)

    experimental_info = [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",  # Placeholder for extracted assay method
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",  # Placeholder for material source
                "Material Name": "HEK293",  # Placeholder for material name
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            # ... (Fill in the remaining details according to the provided JSON format)
        }
    ]

    output = {
        "Variants Include": [
            {
                "Gene": gene,
                "variants": [
                    {
                        "HGVS": variant,
                        "cDNA Change": {
                            "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                            "ref": "G",
                            "alt": "A",
                            "position": "248"
                        },
                        "Protein Change": {
                            "ref": "G",
                            "alt": "D",
                            "position": "83"
                        },
                        "Description in input context": variant  # Placeholder for description in input context
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "Described Disease": {
            "Described Disease": disease,
            "MONDO": mondo_term
        },
        "Experiment Method": experimental_info  # Placeholder for the extracted and formatted experimental information
    }

    return output
