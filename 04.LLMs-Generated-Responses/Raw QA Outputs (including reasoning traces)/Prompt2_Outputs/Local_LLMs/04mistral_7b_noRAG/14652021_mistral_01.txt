Based on the provided context and examples, I will demonstrate how to extract and organize information from a hypothetical literature for the given workflow.

1. Read the literature and extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
   - Literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
   - Since no specific API was mentioned in the context, I assume that this step will involve manually correcting the HGVS nomenclature if necessary or leaving it as is.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
   - The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with no specific MONDO term provided in the literature, so I will assume that this step involves manually searching for the appropriate MONDO term or using an API to do so.

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
   - Assuming the following information is available in the literature:
     - The experiment used Western blotting to measure protein expression.
     - Three biological replicates were performed, and each sample was run in triplicate (three technical replicates).
     - Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control, while an empty vector served as the negative control.
     - A statistical analysis method was not explicitly mentioned, so I will assume that no specific statistical test was applied.
     - The threshold for normal readout is "Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7," and the threshold for abnormal readout is "Protein expression less than 50% on day 7."
   - Since we do not have validation controls P/LP, B/LB counts, or approval status, I will leave these fields empty.

With this information, you can now populate the JSON framework with the following data:
