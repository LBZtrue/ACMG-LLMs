Based on the provided context and workflow, I will provide an example of how to structure the output for the given literature excerpt. In this case, let's assume the literature discusses a variant in the TP53 gene (c.248G>A) related to Hereditary Myopathy.

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345" // This value should be filled by retrieving the MONDO term for Hereditary Myopathy from a database or API.
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            "Readout type": "Quantitative",
            "Biological replicates": {
                "Biological replicates": "Yes",
                "Description": "Three biological replicates were performed."
            },
            "Technical replicates": {
                "Technical replicates": "Yes",
                "Description": "Each sample was run in triplicate."
            },
            // Other fields such as Basic positive control, Basic negative control, Validation controls P/LP, Validation controls B/LB, Statistical analysis method, Threshold for normal readout, Threshold for abnormal readout and Approved assay can be filled based on the information provided in the literature.
        }
    ]
}
```

The missing fields should be filled according to the available information from the literature or any assumptions you make while analyzing the data. It is essential to keep track of sources for the thresholds for normal and abnormal readout, as they play a crucial role in interpreting the results.
