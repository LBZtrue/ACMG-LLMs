Based on the provided literature context, here's an example of how the information would be organized according to the JSON framework. In this example, let's assume that the study mentions a variant in the TP53 gene (c.248G>A; p.G83D) and describes it as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The study also uses Western Blot to determine the effect of this variant on protein expression.

In this example, the JSON structure is filled out as much as possible based on the information provided in the context. However, there are some values that cannot be determined because they are not explicitly stated in the literature. For those missing or unclear elements, "Not Specified" has been used.
