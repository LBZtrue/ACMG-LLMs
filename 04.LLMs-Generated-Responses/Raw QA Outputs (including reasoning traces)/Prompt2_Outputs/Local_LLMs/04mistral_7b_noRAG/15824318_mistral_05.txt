Here is a breakdown of the workflow and an example based on the given context and JSON structure:

1. Extract all relevant variant information from the provided literature, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes.
2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API.
3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database.
4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results.
5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease.
6. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Example:
Let's assume we have the following literature excerpt containing a variant in the TP53 gene:

"A study was conducted on a novel missense variant, c.248G>A (p.G83D), in the TP53 gene. This variant was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and assessed for its effect on protein function using Western Blot analysis. The results showed that the variant causes a partial loss of function, leading to reduced protein expression."

Using this literature excerpt, we can generate the following JSON output:
