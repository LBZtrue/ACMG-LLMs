Based on the information provided in the context, here's a breakdown of the steps to follow and an example response for the given literature.

1. Extract relevant information from the literature:
   - Variant (c.248G>A, p.G83D)
   - Gene name (TP53)
   - Disease studied (Hereditary Myopathy)
   - Experimental methods used (e.g., Western Blot)

2. Standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant API:
   - HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A

3. Retrieve corresponding MONDO term for the disease:
   - MONDO:0012345 (for Hereditary Myopathy)

4. Extract and organize detailed information about each method, according to the predefined JSON framework:
