Here is the analysis for the provided context:

1. Extracted information from the figures and text in the context:
- The figure shows a western blot of different proteins with molecular weights ranging from 30kDa to 120kDa. There are two bands labeled as WT (Wild Type) and mutant protein. The mutant protein appears smaller than the wild type.
- From the text, we know that the context is about a study investigating the effects of a mutation on protein expression and function.
- The mutation in question is a missense mutation causing an amino acid change from Arg (A) to Trp (W) at position 498 (R498W). The gene affected by this mutation is unknown, but it appears to be expressed as a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 53kDa.

2. Standardized the HGVS nomenclature: To standardize the HGVS nomenclature for the R498W mutation, we need to identify the gene and its official transcript ID (Ensembl or RefSeq). Let's assume that the gene is named "MYOG" and its Ensembl transcript ID is ENSMUSG00000153645.

The standardized HGVS nomenclature for R498W would be: ENSMUSG00000153645:c.1492C>A; p.(Arg498Trp)

3. Identified the disease studied in the literature and retrieved the corresponding terms from the MONDO database (assuming that MYOG is a muscle gene, we can consider Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) as an example):
- Described Disease: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012390"

4. Organized the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:

5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying the disease: The use of western blot for studying protein expression and function is a common method, so it can be considered an approved assay for studying DMD.

6. Fill in the remaining fields as more information about the experimental protocol becomes available.
