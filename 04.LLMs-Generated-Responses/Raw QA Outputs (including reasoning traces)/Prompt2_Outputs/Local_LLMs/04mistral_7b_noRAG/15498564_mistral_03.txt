Based on the provided context and workflow, here's an example of how I can extract, standardize, and organize the information from a literature article according to the predefined JSON format:

Assume the literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A", // preliminary HGVS nomenclature from the literature
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)" // additional information about the variant from the literature
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345" // MONDO term for Hereditary Myopathy
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            // Remaining properties for each experimental method will be filled based on the information found in the literature article
        }
    ]
}
```

I'll then proceed to extract and standardize the remaining properties according to the provided JSON format. This example demonstrates how I can parse, standardize, and organize a given literature into a structured JSON format for further analysis or interpretation.
