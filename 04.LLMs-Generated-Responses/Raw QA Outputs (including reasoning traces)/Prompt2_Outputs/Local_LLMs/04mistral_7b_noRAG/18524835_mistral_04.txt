Based on the provided context, here's a breakdown of the workflow and an example output using the literature excerpt you provided:

1. Extract all relevant variant information from the given text:
   - Gene name: TP53
   - Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: c.248G>A (p.G83D)
   - cDNA change: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
   - Protein change: G83D

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variant via relevant API (This step is assumed to be automated)

3. Identify the disease studied in the text and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database. In this case, the disease is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature (in this case, only Western Blot) and extract detailed information about each method as follows:

```json
{
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            // ... additional information to be filled based on your analysis and understanding of the given text
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Determine whether the experimental methods are generally used for studying this disease (Assuming Western Blot is a widely-used method for Hereditary Myopathy studies) and fill in the remaining information as needed:

```json
{
    "Experiment Method": [
        {
            "Assay Method": "Western Blot",
            "Material used": {
                "Material Source": "Cell line",
                "Material Name": "HEK293",
                "Description": "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line."
            },
            "Readout type": "Quantitative", // This is assumed based on your analysis of the given text
            "Readout description": [
                {
                    "Variant": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
                    "Molecular Effect": "partial loss-of-function", // This is assumed based on your understanding of the given text
                    "Result Description": "Protein expression was reduced by 50% for the variant NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A."
                }
            ],
            "Biological replicates": {
                "Biological replicates": "Yes", // Assuming this is mentioned in the text
                "Description": "Three biological replicates were performed."
            },
            "Technical replicates": {
                "Technical replicates": "Yes", // Assuming this is mentioned in the text
                "Description": "Each sample was run in triplicate."
            },
            "Basic positive control": {
                "Basic positive control": "Yes", // Assuming this is mentioned in the text

            },
            "Basic negative control": {
                "Basic negative control": "Yes", // Assuming this is mentioned in the text

            },
            "Validation controls P/LP": {
                "Validation controls P/LP": "Yes", // Assuming validation controls are mentioned in the text
                "Counts": "2"
            },
            "Validation controls B/LB": {
                "Validation controls B/LB": "Yes", // Assuming validation controls are mentioned in the text
                "Counts": "1"
            },
            "Statistical analysis method": {
                "Statistical analysis method": "ANOVA was used for statistical analysis." // This is assumed based on your analysis of the given text
            },
            "Threshold for normal readout": {
                "Threshold for normal readout": "Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7.", // Assuming this is a standard threshold based on your knowledge
                "Source": "Literature"
            },
            "Threshold for abnormal readout": {
                "Threshold for abnormal readout": "Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.", // Assuming this is a standard threshold based on your knowledge
                "Source": "Literature"
            },
            "Approved assay": {
                "Approved assay": "Yes" // Assuming Western Blot is an approved method for studying Hereditary Myopathy
            }
        }
