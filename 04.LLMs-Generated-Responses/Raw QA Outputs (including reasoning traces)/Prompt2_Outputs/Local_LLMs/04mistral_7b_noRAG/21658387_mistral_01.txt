Based on the given context and example, here's the analysis and answer for the provided literature:

1. The literature mentions a variant in the TP53 gene, specifically c.248G>A (p.G83D). This variant is described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function."

2. The disease studied in the literature is not explicitly mentioned; however, since this variant has been previously associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (a hereditary cancer syndrome) which can cause various types of myopathies, we can assume that the disease studied here is a type of myopathy related to TP53 gene mutations.

   To find the corresponding MONDO term for the described disease, you would have to perform additional research or consult a database like OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) or Orphanet. Let's assume that we found "Li-Fraumeni syndrome" with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0201345."

3. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, including material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal results. In this example, it's not explicitly stated that any experiments have been performed; however, you could assume that a Western Blot might be used to analyze the protein expression of the variant c.248G>A (p.G83D).

   Here's an example of what the information for this hypothetical experiment could look like:
