Based on the provided context, workflow, and examples, here's a breakdown of how to apply the framework to a specific literature excerpt:

1. Extract the relevant variant information from the literature:
   In this example, let's assume the following passage is present in the literature: "The study focused on a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), which was found to alter protein function."

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API:
   Since the standardized HGVS nomenclature is provided in the example, we can move on to the next step without needing to perform this action.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database:
   In this case, the disease studied can be identified as Hereditary Myopathy since it is explicitly mentioned in the passage. To find the corresponding MONDO term, you would need to access a reliable database or resource that provides MONDO IDs for various diseases. Let's assume we find "MONDO:0012345" as the corresponding MONDO ID for Hereditary Myopathy.

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method:
   In this example, the study used a Western Blot assay to investigate the variant's impact on protein function. Since only the assay method is specified in the passage, we will make assumptions for the remaining details:

   - Material source: Cell line (e.g., HEK293)
   - Readout type: Quantitative
   - Biological replicates: Yes (Assumption: Three biological replicates were performed.)
   - Technical replicates: Yes (Assumption: Each sample was run in triplicate.)
   - Basic positive control: Yes (Assumption: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.)
   - Basic negative control: Yes (Assumption: Empty vector was used as a negative control.)
   - Validation controls P/LP: Yes (Assumption: Two validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included.)
   - Validation controls B/LB: Yes (Assumption: One validation control for benign/likely benign variants was included.)
   - Statistical analysis method: ANOVA (Assumption: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.)
   - Threshold for normal readout: Protein expression greater than 80% on day 7. (Assumption: The threshold can be determined based on your own knowledge since it is not explicitly mentioned in the literature.)
   - Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7. (Assumption: The threshold can be determined based on your own knowledge since it is not explicitly mentioned in the literature.)
   - Approved assay: Yes (Assumption: Since Western Blot is a commonly used method for studying protein function, it is considered an approved assay for this context.)

5. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
   Using the information gathered in steps 1-4, you can now populate the JSON structure provided in the example to create the final output. Note that the HGVS nomenclature should be properly standardized using an API or a reliable source before organizing the data. Here's an example of how the JSON output could look:
