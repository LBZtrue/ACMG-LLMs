To extract and organize the information from the given literature context, follow these steps based on the provided workflow and example:

1. From the literature, we have the following variant in the TP53 gene: c.248G>A (p.G83D) described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345."

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variant using relevant API (if necessary).

3. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Described Disease": {
        "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
        "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
    },
    "Experiment Method": [
        // Details of the experimental method will be filled in based on further information from the literature.
    ]
}
```

The final JSON structure includes sections for variants, described disease, and experiment methods. The experiment method section will require additional information about the assay used, material sources, readout types, result descriptions, experimental replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, thresholds for normal and abnormal results, and whether the assay is generally used for studying this disease. Fill in these details based on further information from the literature.
