Here's how I would handle the provided literature for the given context:

1. Identify the variants and their preliminary HGVS nomenclature: In the Polymerase gamma (POLG) gene, c.509A>G (p.[Tyr169Cys]) and c.828G>A (p.[Arg276His]).

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API: NM_001131475.3:c.509A>G becomes NM_001131475.3:exon5:c.509A>G, and NM_001131475.3:c.828G>A becomes NM_001131475.3:exon7:c.828G>A.

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database: The disease studied is "Mitochondrial Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0001659."

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method: In this example, there are two methods - Western Blot and Functional Assay.

   For the Western Blot:
      - Material Source: HeLa cells
      - Material Name: POLG cDNA (wild-type and mutant)
      - Readout type: Quantitative
      - Result Description for Tyr169Cys variant: Protein expression was reduced by 40% compared to wild-type.
      - Result Description for Arg276His variant: Protein expression was not significantly different from wild-type.
      - Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
      - Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
      - Basic positive control: Yes, wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
      - Basic negative control: Yes, empty vector was used as a negative control.
      - Validation controls P/LP: Yes, 2 validation controls were included for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants.
      - Validation controls B/LB: Yes, 1 validation control was included for benign/likely benign variants.
      - Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.
      - Threshold for normal readout (Literature): Protein expression greater than 80%.
      - Threshold for abnormal readout (Literature): Protein expression less than 50%.
      - Approved assay: Yes, Western Blot is generally used for studying Mitochondrial Myopathy.

   For the Functional Assay:
      - Material Source: Human skeletal muscle cells
      - Readout type: Quantitative
      - Result Description for Tyr169Cys variant: Respiratory chain activity was reduced by 60%.
      - Result Description for Arg276His variant: No significant effect on respiratory chain activity.
      - Biological replicates: Yes, three biological replicates were performed.
      - Technical replicates: Yes, each sample was run in triplicate.
      - Basic positive control: Yes, normal human skeletal muscle cells were used as a positive control.
      - Basic negative control: Yes, cells treated with mitochondrial inhibitor (e.g., rotenone) were used as a negative control.
      - Validation controls P/LP: No validation controls were included for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the Functional Assay.
      - Validation controls B/LB: No validation controls were included for benign/likely benign variants in the Functional Assay.
      - Statistical analysis method: T-test was used for statistical analysis.
      - Threshold for normal readout (Custom): Respiratory chain activity greater than 80%.
      - Threshold for abnormal readout (Custom): Respiratory chain activity less than 50%.
      - Approved assay: Yes, Functional Assay is generally used for studying Mitochondrial Myopathy.

5. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
