Based on the provided context and examples, here's an interpretation of how to fill out the JSON structure for each literature snippet:

1. For a study mentioning a variant in the TP53 gene, c.248G>A (p.G83D), described as "This variant causes a structural change in the protein, affecting its function." The disease studied is "Hereditary Myopathy," with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345":

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "A",
                        "position": "248"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "G",
                        "alt": "D",
                        "position": "83"
                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.248G>A (p.G83D)"
                }
            ]
        }
],
"Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
},
... (the rest of the JSON structure, populated as detailed in the example)
}
```

2. For a study mentioning another variant in the TP53 gene, c.76T>C (p.I26N), described as "This variant is likely benign":

```json
{
    "Variants Include": [
        {
            "Gene": "TP53",
            "variants": [
                {
                    "HGVS": "NM_001126112.3:c.76T>C",
                    "cDNA Change": {
                        "transcript": "NM_001126112.3",
                        "ref": "T",
                        "alt": "C",
                        "position": "76"
                    },
                    "Protein Change": {
                        "ref": "I",

                    },
                    "Description in input context": "c.76T>C (p.I26N)"
                }
            ]
        }
],
"Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Hereditary Myopathy",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0012345"
},
