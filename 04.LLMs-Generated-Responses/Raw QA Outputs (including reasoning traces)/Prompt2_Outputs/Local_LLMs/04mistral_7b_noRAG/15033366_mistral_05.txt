Here's the analysis for the provided literature excerpts based on the given context and workflow:

Excerpt 1 (Synaptosome article):
- Variants Include:
      [
          {
              "Gene": "SYT1",
              "variants": [
                  {
                      "HGVS": "NM_001134865.2:c.1572C>T",
                      "cDNA Change": {
                          "transcript": "NM_001134865.2",
                          "ref": "C",
                          "alt": "T",
                          "position": "1572"
                      },
                      "Protein Change": {
                          "ref": "S",
                          "alt": "L",
                          "position": "524"
                      },
                      "Description in input context": "The variant causes a single amino acid substitution (S524L) which might have functional consequences."
                  }
              ]
          }
      ]
- Described Disease: Parkinson's disease, with the corresponding MONDO term not explicitly mentioned but can be found as "Parkinson's disease" in the ontology.
- Experiment Method: Western Blot
- Approved assay: Yes (since Western blot is a widely accepted method for studying protein expression changes related to Parkinson's disease)
