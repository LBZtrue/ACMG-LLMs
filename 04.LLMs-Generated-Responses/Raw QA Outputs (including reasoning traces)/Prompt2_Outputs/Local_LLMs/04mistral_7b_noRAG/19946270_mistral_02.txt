Based on the provided context and example, here's a breakdown of how to extract and structure the information from the literature for the given variant (c.248G>A in TP53 gene) and disease (Hereditary Myopathy with corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0012345").

1. Extract all relevant variant information, including gene name, preliminary HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein changes. In this case:
   - Gene: TP53
   - Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (p.G83D)

2. Standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants via relevant API (this step is not shown in the provided example, but it should be done according to the guidelines of the API used).

3. Identify the disease studied in the literature and retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database. In this case:
   - Disease: Hereditary Myopathy
   - MONDO term: "MONDO:0012345"

4. List all experimental methods mentioned in the literature and extract detailed information about each method, as shown in the example provided above. This step requires careful reading of the literature and critical thinking to determine the details of each experiment performed.

5. Organize the extracted and standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework (as shown in the example).

Example:
