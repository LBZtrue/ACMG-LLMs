Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided literature and structure it into a JSON format as per their guidelines. First, I need to carefully read the abstract and the context given.

The abstract mentions mutations in DJ-1 linked to Parkinson's disease. The specific mutations are L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A. The methods used are solution state NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopies. The disease studied is Parkinson's disease. 

Starting with the "Variants Include" section. The gene is DJ-1. For each mutation, I need to convert them into HGVS nomenclature. But the problem is, the literature doesn't provide the transcript numbers. The user mentioned using an API to standardize HGVS, but since I can't access external APIs, I'll have to note that as N.D. However, the user's example shows that even without the transcript, the HGVS can be structured with the variant. Wait, the example uses NM_001126112.3, but in the given context, there's no transcript info. So maybe I should leave the transcript as N.D. or use the format they provided. The user's example has the HGVS as NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A, but in the given context, the mutations are given as L166P, etc. So I need to figure out the cDNA and protein changes. 

For example, L166P: the position is 166, the reference amino acid is Leu (L), and the alternative is Pro (P). But the cDNA change would depend on the specific codon. However, the literature doesn't provide that. So I can't determine the exact cDNA change without more info. Therefore, I'll have to leave cDNA Change as N.D. and only include the protein change. But the user's example includes both cDNA and protein changes. Hmm, this is tricky. Since the literature doesn't specify the transcript or the exact cDNA changes, I should note that as N.D. in the HGVS, cDNA Change, and Protein Change. But the user's example has the protein change as p.G83D. So maybe for each mutation, I can write the protein change as per the amino acid substitution. For example, L166P would be p.Leu166Pro. But without the exact cDNA, I can't fill in the cDNA Change. So in the JSON, for each variant, HGVS would be "N.D.", cDNA Change as N.D., and Protein Change with the ref and alt amino acids and position. But the user's example has the HGVS as a valid format, so maybe I need to use the format even if the transcript is unknown. But the user's instructions say to standardize via API, which I can't do, so I'll have to use N.D. for the HGVS. Wait, the user's example shows that the HGVS is filled in, but in this case, the literature doesn't provide the transcript. So maybe the correct approach is to leave HGVS as N.D. and fill in the cDNA and protein changes as N.D. as well. However, the user's example includes the HGVS, so maybe I should structure it with the variant's position and amino acid change, even if the transcript isn't specified. But the user's instructions say to standardize via API, which I can't do, so I'll have to leave it as N.D. 

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. I need to retrieve the MONDO term. I know that Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0000523. But since I can't access the database, I'll have to state that as N.D. unless I can recall it. The user's example used MONDO:0012345, but in reality, Parkinson's is MONDO:0000523. However, the user might expect me to know that, but since I can't confirm, I'll put it as N.D. unless instructed otherwise. 

For the experiment method, the methods are solution state NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopies. The material used is not specified in the literature, so I'll have to use N.D. The readout type is likely qualitative or quantitative, but the literature mentions structural changes, so maybe qualitative. The readout description would include the results for each mutation. For example, L166P causes structural changes, E64D doesn't, etc. 

The user's example includes details like biological replicates, which the literature doesn't mention. So I'll have to put N.D. for those unless inferred. However, the user's example has "Yes" for some fields, but the literature here doesn't specify. So I'll have to use N.D. for all those unless the literature states otherwise. 

The approved assay is whether the methods are generally used for Parkinson's. NMR and circular dichroism are used for structural analysis, so maybe "Yes" but I'm not sure. However, the user's example has "Yes", so I'll put that as N.D. since the literature doesn't state it. 

Putting it all together, the JSON will have the variants with N.D. for HGVS, cDNA, and protein changes. The disease as Parkinson's with MONDO term as N.D. The experiment method with N.D. for most fields except the method name and readout description. The approved assay as N.D. 

Wait, the user's example includes the readout description with conclusions and molecular effects. The literature says that L166P causes structural changes, E64D does not, etc. So for each variant, I can note the conclusion as "Abnormal" for L166P and "Normal" for E64D, etc. The molecular effect would be "structural change" for L166P, "no structural change" for E64D, and similar for others. 

So, the JSON structure would have "Variants Include" with DJ-1 and each mutation's protein change, "Described Disease" as Parkinson's, and "Experiment Method" with the methods used, readout description for each variant, and other fields as N.D.
