Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided literature and structure it into a JSON format as per their detailed instructions. 

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract mentions two mutations: E46K and E46A (since it says "substitution of Glu 46 for an Ala"). Also, there's a mention of Glu 83 mutated to Lys or Ala. The gene in question is α-synuclein, which is encoded by the SNCA gene. 

For the HGVS nomenclature, I need to standardize these variants. However, the user mentioned using APIs, but since I can't actually call APIs here, I'll have to rely on the information given. The positions are 46 and 83. The original text uses E46K, which would be p.Glu46Lys. Similarly, E46A is p.Glu46Ala. For Glu83, it's p.Glu83Lys and p.Glu83Ala. The cDNA changes would be based on the SNCA transcript. Let's assume the transcript is NM_001126112.3, but the user might have specific info. However, the literature doesn't specify the transcript, so I'll note that as N.D. or use a placeholder.

Next, the disease described. The literature talks about α-synuclein polymerization leading to pathological inclusions, which is associated with Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's is MONDO:0002041. I'll check if that's correct, but since I can't access the database, I'll go with the standard term.

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions the E46K and E46A mutations, and the Glu83 mutations. The methods likely involve expressing these variants and studying their polymerization. The material used might be cell lines or in vitro systems. However, the literature doesn't specify the exact materials, so I'll use "N.D." or infer based on common methods. The readout types are probably qualitative (like polymerization propensity) and quantitative (measuring fibril formation). The results describe increased propensity, different ultrastructures, etc. 

Control settings: The literature mentions wild-type as a control, so basic positive and negative controls might be present. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly state biological or technical replicates, so those would be N.D. Similarly, validation controls aren't mentioned. Statistical methods aren't specified, so that's N.D. Thresholds for normal/abnormal results aren't described, so I'll have to use general knowledge or note N.D. 

The "Approved assay" would depend on whether the methods are standard for Parkinson's. Since the study is on α-synuclein, methods like fibril formation assays are common, so "Yes" might be appropriate.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format, making sure all fields are filled. For any missing info, use "N.D." as per the user's instruction. Also, ensure that the readout description includes all variants from the Variants Include section.
