Okay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want me to extract specific information from the provided literature and structure it into a JSON format as per their detailed instructions. The main components are Variants Include, Described Disease, and Experiment Method.

First, I need to parse the abstract and the given context. The abstract mentions two mutations in the PINK1 gene: p.A244G and p.V317I. The user wants HGVS nomenclature standardized, but the text here doesn't provide the transcript numbers. However, the example shows that the HGVS should be in the format (transcript number:cDNA variation). Since the literature doesn't specify the transcript, I might need to note that as N.D. But wait, the user mentioned to use APIs for standardization. However, without the transcript number, I can't generate the correct HGVS. So, I'll have to leave the HGVS as N.D. unless I can infer the transcript. But the example given uses NM_001126112.3, which is a specific transcript. Since the literature doesn't mention the transcript, I'll have to put N.D. for HGVS and the cDNA change details.

Next, the disease described is Parkinson's disease, specifically PINK1-related parkinsonism. The MONDO term needs to be retrieved. I know that Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0001087. But I should check if there's a more specific term for PINK1-related parkinsonism. However, the user's example used a general term, so maybe the Described Disease here is "Parkinson's disease" and the MONDO term is MONDO:0001087.

For the Experiment Method, the literature mentions that both mutations (p.A244G and p.V317I) were found to abolish the protective effect of wild-type PINK1 against staurosporine-induced apoptosis. So the assay method here is "staurosporine-induced apoptosis assay" or similar. The material used isn't explicitly stated, but the literature might refer to cell lines. However, the text doesn't mention specific materials, so I'll have to put N.D. for Material Source and Name. The Readout type is probably quantitative, but the literature doesn't specify. The Readout description needs to include the variants. The conclusion is "Abnormal" since the mutations abolished the protective effect. The molecular effect is "dominant-negative" or "loss-of-function." The result description is that the mutations prevented the protective effect. 

Replicates, controls, statistical methods, thresholds, and approved assay: The literature doesn't mention biological or technical replicates, so those are N.D. Same with controls. The statistical analysis method isn't mentioned, so N.D. Thresholds for normal/abnormal aren't described, so I'll have to use "Custom" and maybe infer based on standard practices. The approved assay is "Yes" if the method is commonly used for this disease. Since it's an apoptosis assay, it's a standard method for studying such mutations, so "Yes."

Putting this all together, I need to structure each part according to the JSON schema, using N.D. where information isn't present. Also, ensure that the HGVS is standardized, but since the transcript isn't given, it's N.D. The MONDO term for Parkinson's is MONDO:0001087.
