Okay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want me to act as a professional scientific literature miner and data standardization expert. The task is to extract specific information from the provided abstract and structure it into a JSON format as per their detailed schema.

First, I need to parse the abstract and identify the relevant genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods. The abstract mentions PINK1 mutations associated with Parkinson's disease. The variants are in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain. However, the abstract doesn't provide specific HGVS nomenclature for these mutations. The user mentioned using APIs to standardize HGVS, but since the abstract doesn't have specific variants, I might have to note that as N.D. or see if there's any implied information.

Next, the disease described is Parkinson disease, both familial and sporadic. I need to check the MONDO database for the correct term. Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0000246. 

For the experimental methods, the abstract talks about creating stable human dopaminergic neuronal cell lines coexpressing wild-type and mutant PINK1. The methods include oxidative stress, apoptosis rate, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) assessment. The cell lines were subjected to oxidative stress, and outcomes like apoptosis rate and Δψm changes were measured. The experiment compared heterozygous and homozygous states. 

Looking at the "Readout description," the abstract mentions that kinase and C-terminus mutants had higher apoptosis and decreased Δψm. The "Variants Include" section would need the gene (PINK1) and the variants. However, the abstract doesn't specify exact mutations, so I might have to state that as N.D. unless there's a way to infer based on the domains mentioned. Since the abstract doesn't provide specific cDNA or protein changes, I'll have to leave those fields as N.D.

For the experimental methods, the material used is human dopaminergic neuronal cell lines. The readout type is quantitative, as they measured apoptosis rates and Δψm. The "Readout description" would need to reference the variants, but since there are no specific variants listed, this might be N.D. or the description could be based on the domains mentioned. However, the user's example shows that even without specific HGVS, the description can be filled with the context from the literature. So, perhaps the "Description in input context" would be "Mutants in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain."

In the "Approved assay" section, the method is using cell lines under oxidative stress to study PINK1 mutations. Since Parkinson's research often uses such models, I might mark it as "Yes," but the user might expect "N.D." if the literature doesn't explicitly state it. The abstract doesn't mention if this method is generally used, so "Approved assay" could be N.D.

I need to ensure that all fields are filled according to the JSON structure. For any missing information, use "N.D." as per the constraints. Also, check that the MONDO term for Parkinson disease is correctly retrieved. Finally, structure the JSON with the extracted data, making sure not to omit any fields.
