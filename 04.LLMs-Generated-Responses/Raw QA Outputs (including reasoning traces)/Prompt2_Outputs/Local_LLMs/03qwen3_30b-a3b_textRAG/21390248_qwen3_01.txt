Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided literature and structure it into a JSON format as per their detailed instructions. First, I need to carefully read through the abstract and introduction to identify all the relevant genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods.

Starting with the variants. The abstract mentions mutations in LRRK2, specifically R1441G, Y1699C, and G2019S. I need to note these down. The HGVS nomenclature for these variants isn't provided directly in the text, so I'll have to infer them. For example, R1441G would be a substitution at position 1441 of the LRRK2 gene. But since the user wants the HGVS format, I need to check if there's a standard transcript. However, the literature doesn't specify the transcript, so I'll use the gene name and the amino acid change. Wait, the user mentioned using an API to standardize HGVS, but since I can't actually call an API here, I'll have to represent it as per the literature's description. The abstract states "R1441G, Y1699C and G2019S" which are protein changes. The cDNA changes would be the corresponding nucleotide changes, but the text doesn't provide them. So I'll note that as N.D. unless there's more info. However, the user's example shows that if the literature doesn't provide the exact HGVS, maybe it's inferred. But the user also says to use the API for standardization, which I can't do here. So I'll have to represent the HGVS as per the given info, even if it's not fully detailed.

Next, the disease. The study is about Parkinson's disease (PD), so the MONDO term for PD is MONDO:0000089. I need to confirm that, but I think that's correct. The user wants the disease term retrieved from MONDO, so I'll use that.

For experimental methods, the abstract mentions affinity purification and mass spectrometric analysis. Also, developing an anti-pS935 antibody, which is an immunoassay. The methods include phosphorylation site identification, binding assays with 14-3-3 proteins, and in vitro kinase assays with PKA. The material sources are mouse brain, and the study uses various tissues and ages in mice. The readout types would be quantitative (phosphorylation levels) and qualitative (binding presence). The results describe the phosphorylation at S935, 14-3-3 binding, and the effect of mutations. 

Now, checking for replicates, controls, etc. The abstract doesn't mention biological or technical replicates, so those would be N.D. Similarly, positive and negative controls aren't explicitly stated. The statistical methods aren't detailed, so that's N.D. The threshold for normal/abnormal isn't provided, so I'll have to state that as N.D. or use general knowledge, but the user says to use literature if possible. Since it's not mentioned, I'll put N.D. 

The "Approved assay" for each method: affinity purification and mass spec are standard techniques, so maybe "Yes" for some, but the user's example had "Yes" for Western Blot. However, the user's instructions say to determine if the method is generally used for the disease. Since the study is about LRRK2 in PD, the methods like mass spec and antibody-based assays are common in such studies, so "Yes" might be appropriate. But I need to check if the methods are standard for PD research. I think they are, so "Yes" for each method.

Putting it all together into the JSON structure. Making sure each section is filled with the info from the text, using N.D. where necessary. Also, ensuring that the HGVS is as per the literature, even if incomplete. The user's example had the HGVS with transcript, but since the literature here doesn't specify, I'll use the gene name and the amino acid change, perhaps with a placeholder for the transcript, but the user might expect that. However, without the transcript, I can't provide the exact HGVS. So I'll note the HGVS as per the given info, even if it's not fully detailed. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the exact HGVS format, but since it's not in the text, I'll have to state it as "NM_001126112.3:c.?" but that's not possible. So perhaps the answer will have the HGVS as per the protein change, but that's not standard. This is a bit tricky. Maybe the user expects that the HGVS is not available here, so it's left as N.D. or inferred. But the user's example had a specific HGVS. Hmm. 

Wait, the user's example had "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" which is a cDNA change. The literature here mentions R1441G, which is a protein change. To convert that to cDNA, we need the transcript. Since the literature doesn't provide it, I can't generate the exact HGVS. So in this case, the HGVS would be N.D. unless there's a standard transcript. But the user's instructions say to standardize via API, which I can't do here. Therefore, I'll have to represent the HGVS as per the given information, even if incomplete. So for R1441G, the HGVS would be something like "LRRK2:c.?" but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the HGVS isn't provided and thus marked as N.D. But the user's example had it filled. This is a bit of a dilemma. 

Given the constraints, I'll proceed with the information available, noting that the HGVS couldn't be determined from the text and mark it as N.D., but the user's example might have a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the protein change is converted into cDNA, but without the transcript, it's not possible. Therefore, the HGVS will be marked as N.D., and the cDNA change and protein change sections will be filled based on the text. 

Finally, structuring all this into the JSON as per the user's workflow, making sure each field is addressed with the available data.
