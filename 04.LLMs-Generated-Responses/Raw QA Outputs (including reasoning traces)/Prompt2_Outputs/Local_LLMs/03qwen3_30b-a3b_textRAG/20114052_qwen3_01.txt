Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided abstract and structure it into a JSON format as per their detailed instructions. First, I need to identify all the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract mentions the E46K mutation in α-synuclein. The gene here is SNCA, since α-synuclein is encoded by that gene.

Next, the HGVS nomenclature. The variant is E46K, which is a substitution. The cDNA change would be from G to A at position 138 (since E46 is the 46th amino acid, and each codon is 3 nucleotides, so 46*3=138). The protein change is Glu (G) to Lys (K) at position 46. But I need to check the transcript. The abstract doesn't specify the transcript, so I'll have to note that as N.D. or use a standard one. Wait, the user mentioned standardizing via API, but since I can't access APIs, I'll have to leave it as per the literature. The abstract says "E46K" but doesn't give the transcript, so I'll put "N.D." for the transcript and position, but the user example had specific numbers. Hmm, maybe the position is 46 in the protein, so the cDNA position would be 138 (46*3). But without the transcript, it's hard. The example used NM_001126112.3 for TP53, but for SNCA, the transcript might be NM_001126112.3 or another. Since the abstract doesn't specify, I'll have to use "N.D." for the transcript and position, but the user's example had specific values. Maybe I should infer based on standard nomenclature. Alternatively, the user might expect that the HGVS is written as NM_...:c.138G>A, but without the transcript, it's uncertain. The user's instruction says to standardize via API, but since I can't, I'll note it as N.D. for the transcript and position, but the example had specific numbers. This is a bit conflicting.

Next, the disease described is Parkinson's disease (PD). I need to find the MONDO term for PD. From my knowledge, MONDO:0000073 is Parkinson's disease. But I should confirm. However, since I can't access the database, I'll use that as a placeholder.

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions several: ganglioside-binding domain identification, interaction with glycosphingolipids, 3′-sialyllactose inhibition, alanine substitutions, and channel formation in phosphatidylcholine bilayers. The main methods are probably "Ganglioside-binding assay", "Channel formation assay", and "Alanine substitution analysis". 

Material sources: The abstract mentions synthetic GBD peptides, reconstituted phosphatidylcholine bilayers, and GM3. The material name would be "synthetic GBD peptides" or "phosphatidylcholine bilayers". The description would be from the text, like "synthetic GBD peptides were used" or "reconstituted phosphatidylcholine bilayers".

Readout types: The results include interaction with GM3, channel conductance, selectivity, asymmetrical response, and single-channel activity. These are quantitative. The readout description should list the variants, which is the E46K mutation.

Experimental replicates: The abstract doesn't mention biological or technical replicates, so N.D. Similarly, controls: positive and negative controls aren't detailed, so N.D. Validation controls: not mentioned. Statistical analysis methods: not specified, so N.D. Thresholds for normal/abnormal: the abstract doesn't provide specific thresholds, so I'll have to use custom ones based on knowledge, like "Protein interaction greater than 50% for normal" and "Less than 20% for abnormal", but since the user example used literature-based, maybe I should note that they aren't described.

Approved assay: The methods are specific to the study, so "No" unless they are standard. Since the methods are novel (like channel formation in bilayers), it might not be an approved assay for PD. So "No".

Putting it all together, the JSON structure would have the variant with N.D. for transcript and position, the disease as PD with MONDO:0000073, and the experiment methods with the details from the abstract. I need to ensure all fields are filled as per the user's example, even if some are N.D. or custom.
