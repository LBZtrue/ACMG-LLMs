Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract information from the provided literature abstract about variants in the α-synuclein gene, standardize the HGVS notation, identify the disease using MONDO, and detail the experimental methods. 

First, I need to identify the variants mentioned. The abstract talks about E46K and E46A mutations, as well as E83K and E83A. Each of these is a substitution in the α-synuclein protein. The gene here is SNCA, so I'll note that.

Next, standardizing the HGVS nomenclature. For each variant, I need the transcript ID. The literature mentions α-synuclein, which is SNCA. The common transcript for SNCA is likely NM_002904.3. So, for E46K, the cDNA change would be at position 136 (since E46 is the 46th amino acid; each amino acid is 3 nucleotides, so 46*3=138, but need to check exact position). However, the exact cDNA position might not be provided in the abstract. Since the user wants me to use an API, but I don't have access, I'll have to note that as N.D. for now. Wait, the user says to standardize via API, but since I can't do that, maybe I should proceed with the information given and mark HGVS as N.D.?

Wait, the example uses a specific transcript. The user might expect that even if the exact transcript isn't in the literature, I use a standard one. For SNCA, the transcript is NM_002904.3. The wild-type codon for E46 is GAA (Glu). Changing to K (Lys) would be a G-to-A change at the first position? Or maybe the exact cDNA change isn't specified, so I need to mark it as N.D. But the example uses a specific transcript. Hmm. Since the literature doesn't provide the exact cDNA positions, I'll have to use N.D. for the transcript and cDNA details. But the user said to standardize via API. Since I can't access an API, perhaps I should proceed with what's possible.

For the variants, the protein changes are E46K, E46A, E83K, E83A. The cDNA changes would depend on the codon. For example, E46 is encoded by GAA. Changing to K (Lys) would require changing the third base to T, making it GAT? Wait, no. Let me think. The codon for Glutamic acid (E) is GAA or GAG. Lysine (K) is AAA or AAG. So to change E46 to K, the codon would change from GAA to AAA, which is a G to A change at the first position. So the cDNA change would be a G to A substitution at position corresponding to the first base of the codon. But without knowing the exact transcript's sequence, I can't get the exact position. Therefore, the cDNA details would be N.D. Similarly for E46A, which would be a substitution to Alanine, whose codons are GCA, GCC, etc. But again, exact position is unknown. So I'll have to note those as N.D.

Next, the disease. The literature mentions that aberrant α-synuclein polymerization leads to pathological inclusions and disease. The most common disease associated with SNCA mutations is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO ID for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0004986. So I'll use that.

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions studying the effect of these mutations on fibrillization. The methods likely involve in vitro polymerization assays, such as ThT fluorescence to monitor fibril formation. The material sources might be recombinant proteins or cell lines expressing the variants. The readout types would be quantitative (e.g., ThT fluorescence over time). The results would compare the polymerization rates between wild-type and mutants. However, the abstract doesn't mention specific methods like cell lines or statistical tests, so many details would be N.D. The approved assay for Parkinson's disease related to α-synuclein would be in vitro aggregation assays, which are standard. So Approved assay would be Yes.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure would include the variants with N.D. for some fields, the disease as Parkinson's with MONDO ID, and the experimental methods with as much detail as possible, noting N.D. where information is missing.
