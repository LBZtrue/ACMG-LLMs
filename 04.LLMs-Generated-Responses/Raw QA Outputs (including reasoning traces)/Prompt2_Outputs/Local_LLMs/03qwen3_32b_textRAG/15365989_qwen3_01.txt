Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature to extract the necessary information. The user wants me to focus on genetic variants, the disease, and experimental methods. 

First, the variants mentioned in the literature. The main variant here is c.192G>C (p.E64D) in the DJ1 gene. The description in the text is "c.192G>C (p.E64D)". I need to standardize the HGVS notation. The correct HGVS for the cDNA change would be NM_001001575.3:c.192G>C. The protein change is p.E64D. I'll check the transcript number using an API, but since the example uses NM_... I'll follow that format.

Next, the disease studied. The literature refers to early-onset Parkinson disease (EOPD), which is an autosomal recessive form. Looking up MONDO for EOPD, the correct term is MONDO:0003297. 

Now, the experimental methods. The first method is [18F]FP-CIT and PET for dopamine uptake in the striatum. The material used is a patient of Turkish ancestry. The readout type is quantitative. The results mention a substantial reduction in DAT binding in the patient, and reduced dopamine uptake in the sister compared to the brother. The conclusion here is abnormal, with a molecular effect of partial loss-of-function. 

The second method is crystallography to study the E64D mutation's effect on DJ1 structure. The material is HEK293 and COS7 cells. The readout type is structural, showing no structural change. The molecular effect is no effect.

The third method is immunocytochemistry comparing wild-type and mutant DJ1 in HEK293 cells. The readout is qualitative, showing nuclear localization in some cells. The conclusion is abnormal with a possible dominant-negative effect.

For each experiment, I need to note the controls, replicates, and statistical methods. The literature doesn't mention specific controls for the PET scan, but the crystallography and immunocytochemistry might use wild-type as a control. Replicates aren't specified, so they'll be N.D. Statistical methods aren't detailed either. Thresholds for normal/abnormal would need to be inferred based on the results described.

I need to ensure all fields are filled according to the JSON structure, using N.D. where information is missing. Also, check if the methods are generally used for EOPD. PET is commonly used in PD studies, crystallography for structural analysis, and immunocytochemistry for localization, so those would be approved assays.
