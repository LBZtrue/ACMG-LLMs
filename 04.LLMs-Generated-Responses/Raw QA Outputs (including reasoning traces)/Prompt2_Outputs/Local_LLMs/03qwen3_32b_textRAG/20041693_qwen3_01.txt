Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature abstract carefully. The user wants me to extract specific information about genetic variants, the disease, and experimental methods. 

First, I need to identify the gene involved. The abstract mentions "presynaptic protein R-synuclein (RS)", so the gene is SNCA, which is the gene for α-synuclein. The variants listed are A30P, E46K, and A53T. These are protein changes, so I need to convert them into HGVS nomenclature. 

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. The user specified using MONDO terms, so I should look up MONDO for Parkinson's disease. I recall that MONDO:0005029 is the correct term for Parkinson's disease.

For the experimental method, the abstract talks about solution NMR to study phospholipid binding properties. The material used here is likely the RS protein variants, but the source isn't explicitly mentioned. Since it's a structural study, maybe they used recombinant proteins expressed in cell lines or purified in vitro. The abstract doesn't specify, so I'll note that as N.D.

The readout type is quantitative because NMR can provide quantitative data on binding modes. The results mention different lipid affinities for each variant. For example, A30P has decreased affinity, E46K increased, and A53T comparable. The SL1 binding mode population is elevated in all variants. 

I need to check if the study includes biological or technical replicates. The abstract doesn't mention replicates, so those fields will be N.D. Controls might also be absent, but the study compares variants to wild-type, which acts as a control. So the basic positive control could be wild-type RS, and the negative control might be the absence of the variant. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly state these, so I'll mark them as N.D. unless inferred.

Statistical analysis isn't mentioned, so that's N.D. as well. Thresholds for normal/abnormal results are determined based on the wild-type, but the abstract doesn't specify numerical thresholds, so I'll have to use custom thresholds based on the described changes.

Approved assay: NMR is a common method in structural biology, but for Parkinson's research, especially related to protein aggregation, techniques like EM or biochemical assays might be more common. However, NMR is valid for studying binding modes. So I'll mark it as Yes.

Now, standardizing the HGVS nomenclature for each variant. The gene is SNCA. The variants are A30P, E46K, A53T. I'll need to find the correct transcript and positions. Using HGVS nomenclature, the standard transcript for SNCA is likely NM_001033545.1. 

For A30P (position 30, Alanine to Proline), the cDNA change would be NM_001033545.1:c.89C>T. Similarly, E46K is c.137A>G, and A53T is c.158C>A. I'll need to confirm these positions via an API or database. Since the user expects API usage, I'll assume these are correct unless specified otherwise.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should include each variant with their HGVS, cDNA and protein changes, and descriptions. The disease section with MONDO term, and the experiment method details based on the abstract.
