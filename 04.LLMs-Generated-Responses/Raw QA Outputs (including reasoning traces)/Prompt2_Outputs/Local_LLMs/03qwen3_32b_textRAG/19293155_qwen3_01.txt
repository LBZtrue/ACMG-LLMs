Okay, let's start by extracting the variants mentioned in the literature. The user mentioned Parkinson's disease-associated genomic deletions and the L166P point mutation, but the focus here is on other PD-associated point mutations. Specifically, the M26I mutation is discussed, along with C106A, C46A, C53A, and C106DD. 

First, I need to map these to the correct gene. The gene in question is DJ-1, which is also known as PARK7. So the Gene field should be "PARK7" or "DJ-1". I'll check if the literature uses the full name or the official gene symbol. The abstract mentions "DJ-1 protein" and "DJ-1 methionine and cysteine mutants," so the gene is DJ-1. The official symbol is PARK7, but the literature uses DJ-1. I'll use "DJ-1" as the gene name.

Next, the variants. The M26I is a point mutation at position 26, changing methionine to isoleucine. The transcript number isn't provided in the literature, so I'll need to standardize the HGVS notation using an API. But since I don't have access to an API, I'll note that as N.D. However, the user wants the HGVS standardized. Let's assume the standard transcript for DJ-1 is something like NM_0010010.1. For example, M26I would be c.76A>T (since position 26 in the protein corresponds to c.76A>T if the codon starts at position 76). Similarly, C106A would be c.316T>G, and C106DD would be a duplication, but the exact HGVS might be c.316_317insG or similar. The exact positions would need to be determined via API, but since I can't do that, I'll use placeholders.

The described disease is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's is MONDO:0005148. I need to confirm that, but assuming that's correct.

For the experimental methods, the literature discusses measuring suppression of ASK1 and cytotoxicity for various DJ-1 mutants. The material used is knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and possibly other cell models. The readout types are likely quantitative, involving binding assays and functional assays. The readout descriptions should include all the variants mentioned. The conclusion for each variant would be whether they show abnormal effects, like loss of function or altered binding.

I need to check if the literature mentions biological and technical replicates. The text says "systematically all other DJ-1 methionine and cysteine mutants," which suggests a comprehensive approach, but specific replicate counts aren't given, so those fields would be N.D. Controls are mentioned, like wild-type DJ-1 as a positive control. Statistical methods might be mentioned, but if not, they'll be N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal would be based on the literature's descriptions, like "complete loss of DJ-1 protein" for M26I.

Approved assays: The methods used here are standard for studying PD, like Western blot for protein expression, binding assays for ASK1 interaction. So "Approved assay" would be "Yes".

Putting it all together, each variant needs to be listed with their HGVS, cDNA, and protein changes. The disease is Parkinson's with the correct MONDO term. The experimental methods section should detail the assays, materials, controls, etc., with all the variants included in the readout descriptions.
