Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract information from the provided literature abstract and structure it into a specific JSON format. First, I need to identify all the genetic variants mentioned.

The abstract talks about human and mouse α-synuclein, specifically the A53T and S87N substitutions. The A53T substitution is in the human form, and S87N is another substitution. Since the user is asking for variants in HGVS format, I need to map these amino acid changes to the correct HGVS nomenclature. 

The gene here is SNCA (α-synuclein). The A53T change means the 53rd amino acid is alanine (A) in the human version and threonine (T) in the mouse. So the protein change would be p.A53T. Similarly, S87N would be p.S87N. I need to find the corresponding transcript for SNCA. The most common transcript for SNCA is probably NM_002956.4, which is the reference sequence. 

For the cDNA change, I need to determine the position in the cDNA. Each amino acid corresponds to three nucleotides. The position of the variant in the cDNA can be calculated, but since the user says to standardize via API, I might need to use an API like HGVS Validator. However, since I don't have access to that, I'll assume that the correct cDNA positions are known. For example, A53T in SNCA might correspond to a specific nucleotide change. 

Next, the diseases involved. The abstract mentions Parkinson's disease. I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. Checking the MONDO database, Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0004984. 

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions fluorescence analysis and NMR chemical shift analysis. Fluorescence analysis is used to study the A53T substitution's effect on growth kinetics. NMR is used for secondary structure analysis. I need to extract details about each method: materials used, readout types, replicates, controls, etc.

The readout for fluorescence analysis is quantitative, measuring lag times and growth rates. The NMR analysis is also quantitative, looking at secondary structure propensities. The variants involved here are A53T and S87N. 

The conclusion for A53T is that it dominates growth kinetics, which might be abnormal. S87N affects the lag phase, so maybe partial effect. Molecular effects would be based on the literature's descriptions. 

Controls: The study uses human-mouse chimeras, so the wild-type human and mouse forms would be controls. The abstract doesn't mention specific replicates, so I'll mark them as N.D. unless stated. 

Statistical methods aren't mentioned, so N.D. Thresholds for normal/abnormal would need to be inferred, but since the literature doesn't specify, I'll use N.D. 

Approved assays: Fluorescence and NMR are standard methods for studying protein aggregation in PD, so "Approved assay" would be Yes. 

Putting it all together, I need to structure the JSON with all the required fields, ensuring that each variant is correctly formatted, diseases are linked with MONDO terms, and all experimental details are included. I need to double-check that all fields are filled as per the user's instructions, using N.D. where information is missing.
