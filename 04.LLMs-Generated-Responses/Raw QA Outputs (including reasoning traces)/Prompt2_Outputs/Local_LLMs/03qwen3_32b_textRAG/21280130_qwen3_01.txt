Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature to extract the necessary information. The user wants me to focus on genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods, and structure them in JSON with specific fields.

First, the variants. The literature mentions the A30P mutation in the α-synuclein (aS) protein. The gene is SNCA. I need to determine the HGVS nomenclature. The mutation is A30P, which is an amino acid substitution. The transcript number for SNCA is likely NM_000343.3. The cDNA change would be from G to C at position 89 (since A30 is the 30th amino acid, which corresponds to position 89 in the cDNA for SNCA). So the HGVS would be NM_000343.3:c.89G>C. The cDNA change and protein change need to be structured accordingly.

Next, the disease. The study is on Parkinson's disease. I'll need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's. Checking the MONDO database, Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0004981.

For the experimental methods, the literature mentions quenched hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to NMR spectroscopy and two-dimensional proton-detected high-resolution magic angle spinning experiments. These are the two main methods. I need to detail each method's material used, readout types, etc. However, the literature doesn't specify the material sources beyond mentioning the use of aS fibrils. The readout type would be qualitative based on the conclusions about the structural changes. The readout description should include the A30P variant and the conclusion that the mutation doesn't change the fibril structure. 

Replicates and controls: The literature doesn't mention biological or technical replicates explicitly, so those would be N.D. Similarly, no specific controls are described, so controls would be N.D. Statistical methods aren't detailed either. Thresholds for normal and abnormal results aren't provided in the literature, so I'll use custom thresholds based on typical standards. The approved assay for Parkinson's would be yes since NMR and HDX are commonly used in amyloid research.

Putting it all together, ensuring that all fields are filled with the correct information, and using N.D. where information is missing. Also, standardizing the HGVS and MONDO terms as required.
