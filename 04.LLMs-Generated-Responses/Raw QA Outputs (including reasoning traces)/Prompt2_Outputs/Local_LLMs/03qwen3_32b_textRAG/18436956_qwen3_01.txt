Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract information from the provided literature about DJ-1 mutations linked to Parkinson's disease and structure it into the specified JSON format. First, I need to identify all the variants mentioned. The abstract lists five mutations: L166P, E64D, M26I, A104T, and D149A. 

Next, I need to convert these into HGVS nomenclature. Since the user mentioned standardizing via an API, but since I can't actually call an API, I'll have to assume the correct HGVS format. For example, L166P would be something like NM_001005481.2:c.497T>C (assuming the transcript and position). However, the exact HGVS might require looking up the specific transcript for DJ-1. Since the literature doesn't specify the transcript, I'll have to note that as N.D. or make an educated guess based on common transcripts for DJ-1.

The disease is Parkinson's disease, so I need to find the MONDO term. From my knowledge, MONDO:0005212 is for Parkinson's disease. 

For the experimental methods, the literature mentions solution state NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopies. I need to detail each method, the materials used (wild-type and mutant proteins), readout types (quantitative, as they measure structural stability), and the results. The readout descriptions should include all the variants. 

I also need to check for experimental details like replicates, controls, statistical methods, and thresholds. The literature doesn't mention specific numbers of replicates or controls, so those would be N.D. The thresholds for normal and abnormal would be inferred based on the descriptions like "severe destabilization" and "reduction in stability". 

Lastly, determining if the methods are approved for Parkinson's. NMR and CD are common in structural studies, so probably yes. 

I need to structure all this into the JSON, making sure to fill in N.D. where information is missing and ensure the HGVS is as accurate as possible given the data. Also, cross-checking MONDO terms and ensuring each variant is correctly mapped.
