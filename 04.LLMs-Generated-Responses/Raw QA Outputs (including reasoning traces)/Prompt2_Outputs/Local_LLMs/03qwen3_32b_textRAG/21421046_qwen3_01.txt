Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature abstract and introduction to extract the necessary information. The user wants me to act as a professional literature miner and data standardization expert, so I need to be thorough and precise.

First, the variants. The abstract mentions three PARK6 mutations: G309D, E417G, and CΔ145 in the PINK1 gene. I need to convert these into HGVS nomenclature. The problem is, the user wants me to standardize the HGVS via an API. Since I can't access external APIs, I'll have to rely on standard HGVS formats. 

For G309D, assuming the reference amino acid is glutamic acid (Glu) at position 309 changing to aspartic acid (Asp), the protein change would be p.G309D. For the cDNA change, I need to know the transcript version. The PINK1 gene's common transcript is likely NM_004560. The position in cDNA would depend on the codon. For example, if G309 is caused by a G to A change at position 926 (since codons are three nucleotides), but without the exact transcript, I'll have to note that. Similarly, E417G would be p.E417G, and CΔ145 is a deletion of 145 codons. 

Next, the disease is PARK6, which is Parkinson's disease type 6. I need to find the MONDO ID. From my knowledge, Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005009, but the specific type 6 might have a sub-ontology. However, since the user wants the MONDO term for the disease studied, and the literature refers to it as PARK6, which is a form of Parkinson's disease, the MONDO term would be MONDO:0005009.

For the experimental methods, the study used confocal imaging on cultured SN dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 knockout mice. The readout types would include mitochondrial membrane potential, morphology, ROS generation, and cell death. The variants tested were the three PARK6 mutants. The results showed that these variants failed to rescue mitochondrial dysfunction. 

I need to check if the experiments had biological and technical replicates. The abstract mentions "cultured SN dopaminergic neurons prepared from PINK1 knockout mice" but doesn't specify the number of replicates. So, I'll mark those as N.D. Controls would include wild-type PINK1 overexpression as a positive control and the knockout cells as a negative control. 

Statistical analysis isn't mentioned, so that's N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal results aren't specified either, so I'll set them as N.D. The approved assay would be "Yes" if confocal imaging is standard for mitochondrial studies in Parkinson's.

Putting it all together, I need to structure the JSON with the variants, disease, and experiment methods. Since I can't access APIs, I'll format the HGVS as best as possible based on standard conventions. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease type 6 isn't directly available, so I'll use the general Parkinson's term. The experimental methods section will detail the confocal imaging with the respective readouts and controls.
