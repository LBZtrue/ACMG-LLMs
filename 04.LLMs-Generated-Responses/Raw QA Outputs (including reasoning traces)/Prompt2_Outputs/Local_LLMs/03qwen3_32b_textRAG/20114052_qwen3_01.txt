Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature abstract carefully. The user wants me to extract information about genetic variants, the disease, and experimental methods, then structure them into the specified JSON format.

First, the variants. The abstract mentions the E46K mutation in α-synuclein (α-syn) linked to a familial form of Parkinson's disease. The gene here is SNCA, encoding α-syn. The mutation is at position 46, changing glutamate (E) to lysine (K). So the protein change is E46K. Now, for HGVS nomenclature, I need to determine the correct transcript. SNCA has several transcripts, but the most common one is likely NM_003111.1. The cDNA change would be a substitution at position 137 (assuming the codon for E is at position 137, but I need to confirm. Wait, the fragment discussed is 34-50, but the mutation is at position 46. Let me check the SNCA gene structure. The E46K mutation in α-syn corresponds to c.137A>G in the transcript NM_003111.1. So the HGVS should be NM_003111.1:c.137A>G. The cDNA change is ref A, alt G at position 137. The protein change is E46K. The description in the input context is "E46K mutation site...linked to a familial form of PD".

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for PD is MONDO:0006105. I need to verify that via the MONDO database, but based on prior knowledge, that's correct.

For experimental methods, the abstract mentions several. The first is the identification of the ganglioside-binding domain (fragment 34-50). The second is the interaction with glycosphingolipids, especially GM3, using synthetic GBD peptides. The third is the formation of channels in phosphatidylcholine bilayers, comparing wild-type and E46K mutant. The fourth is the effect of GM3 on channel formation. The fifth is the use of 3′-sialyllactose as an inhibitor. The sixth is the effect of GM3 and GM1 in bilayers. The seventh is the effect of GBD peptides on α-syn interaction with GM3.

Each of these is an experimental method. Let's take the first one: identifying the GBD in α-syn. The material used is synthetic GBD peptides. The readout type is structural analysis. The result is that this fragment is structurally related to GBD shared by other proteins. The conclusion here is normal, as it's a structural confirmation. The variant E46K is involved here. The molecular effect is increased affinity for GM3. The result description would be that the E46K mutant has stronger affinity for GM3 than wild-type.

Another method is the channel formation in phosphatidylcholine bilayers. The materials are reconstituted phosphatidylcholine bilayers. The readout is the channel properties (conductance, selectivity, etc.). The variant E46K forms channels with lower conductance, higher cation selectivity, asymmetrical voltage response, and nonstop activity. When GM3 is present, the E46K-associated channelopathy is corrected. The conclusion here is abnormal for E46K without GM3, and normal with GM3. The molecular effect is altered channel formation. The result description would detail these properties.

I need to check if there are biological or technical replicates mentioned. The abstract says "Alanine substitutions...resulted in limited interaction" which implies some experimental setup but doesn't mention replicates. So for most entries, replicates might be N.D. (Not Described). Similarly, statistical analysis methods aren't specified, so those would be N.D. as well. Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts also aren't provided in the abstract, so those would be determined based on standard practices, but the user wants to use literature if possible. Since the abstract doesn't specify, I'll have to use "Custom" as the source.

Approved assay: The methods used, like electrophysiological studies for channel formation, are generally used for studying PD-related channelopathies. So "Approved assay" would be Yes for some methods, but others like structural analysis might be N.D.

Putting this all together into the JSON structure, ensuring each experiment is detailed with the required fields. Also, standardizing the HGVS nomenclature for the E46K mutation. Need to confirm the exact transcript and position. SNCA's E46K is a well-known mutation, so the c.137A>G is correct for transcript NM_003111.1. The protein position is 46.
