Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided abstract and structure it into the given JSON format. First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract mentions three point mutations in α-Synuclein: A30P, E46K, and A53T. These are associated with early-onset familial PD. 

Next, I need to convert these into HGVS nomenclature. Since the user mentioned standardizing via API, I'll have to assume the correct transcripts. For α-Synuclein (SNCA), the common transcript is NM_000345.4. So, A30P would be c.89C>T (since the amino acid position 30 corresponds to codon 89 in the cDNA), E46K is c.137A>G (amino acid 46 is codon 137), and A53T is c.158C>A (amino acid 53 is codon 158). 

For the disease, Parkinson's Disease is the focus. The MONDO ID for Parkinson's is MONDO:0004988. 

Now, the experimental methods. The abstract talks about using the 20S proteasome and liposomes to study the mutations. The methods involved in vitro cleavage, fibrillization, and oligomer formation. The materials used are likely recombinant α-Syn proteins (wildtype and mutants). The readouts are about fragmentation, conformation, and association reactions. The key point is that the soluble oligomers' formation rate correlates with the mutations when 20S and liposomes are present.

I need to check if the experiments had biological or technical replicates. The abstract doesn't mention specific numbers, so I'll put N.D. for those. Controls might include wildtype as a control, but the text doesn't specify, so again N.D. Statistical methods aren't mentioned either. The approved assays would be methods like in vitro proteolysis and fibrillization assays, which are standard in PD research. 

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the variants, disease info, and experimental methods as described. Make sure to include all required fields, even if some are N.D. Also, ensure the readout descriptions include all variants. The conclusion for each variant would be abnormal since their oligomer formation rates are higher, but the abstract doesn't specify the exact effects beyond correlation. Molecular effects are N.D. here.
