Okay, let me start by reading through the provided literature to extract the necessary information. The user wants a structured JSON output with specific sections. First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract and introduction mention the I2020T mutation in the LRRK2 gene. The HGVS nomenclature here is important. The original context says "I2020T" which refers to the protein change, but I need to convert this to HGVS format. 

The gene is LRRK2. The mutation is in the kinase domain, so I need to find the correct transcript. The standard HGVS for LRRK2 is usually NM_004192.4. The I2020T mutation would then be c.6058A>C, since isoleucine (I) at position 2020 changes to threonine (T). So the HGVS would be NM_004192.4:c.6058A>C. The cDNA change would be transcript NM_004192.4, reference nucleotide A, alternative C at position 6058. The protein change is I (isoleucine) to T (threonine) at position 2020. 

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease, specifically autosomal dominant PD (PARK8). I need to find the MONDO term for Parkinson's disease. Checking the MONDO database, the MONDO ID for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0004684.

For the experimental methods, the study mentions hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis and proteolysis inhibitors. The main assays here would be apoptosis assays, maybe using cell lines. The materials used are likely cell lines, as they mention knocking down LRRK2 and using proteolysis inhibitors. The readout type would be quantitative, measuring the protective effect against apoptosis. 

The variants in the Readout description need to include the I2020T mutation. The results show that the I2020T mutant has impaired protective effect, which becomes increased when proteolysis is inhibited. Also, knocking down wild-type LRRK2 reduces protectivity. 

I need to check if the experiments had biological and technical replicates. The literature doesn't explicitly mention replicates, so those fields would be N.D. Controls might include wild-type as a positive control and maybe an empty vector as a negative control. Statistical analysis methods aren't specified, so also N.D. Thresholds for normal and abnormal results aren't mentioned in the literature, so I'll use custom thresholds based on typical apoptosis assays, like a certain percentage of cell survival. 

Approved assays for Parkinson's disease would include apoptosis assays, so that's "Yes". 

Putting all this together into the JSON structure, making sure all fields are filled according to the user's specifications. Variants, disease with MONDO, and detailed experimental methods with all required sections.
