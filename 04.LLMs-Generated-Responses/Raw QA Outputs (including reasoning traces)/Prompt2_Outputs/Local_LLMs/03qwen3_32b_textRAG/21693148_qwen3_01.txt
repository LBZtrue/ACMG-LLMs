Okay, let's start by extracting the variants mentioned in the literature. The first variant is D30K in UCH-L1. The original description says "D30K UCH-L1, which lacks ubiquitin binding activity." So I need to convert this into HGVS nomenclature. The gene is UCHL1. The protein change is from Aspartic acid (D) at position 30 to Lysine (K). The cDNA change would depend on the transcript, but the user wants to standardize via API. Since I don't have access to the API, I'll note that the HGVS needs to be standardized.

Next, C90S UCH-L1, which lacks hydrolase activity. The protein change is Cysteine (C) to Serine (S) at position 90. Similarly, the I93M mutation is mentioned in the context of Parkinson's disease. The amino acid at position 93 changes from Isoleucine (I) to Methionine (M). These are the three variants: D30K, C90S, I93M.

For the disease, the study mentions Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's disease is MONDO:0005140. I'll need to confirm that, but based on prior knowledge, that's the correct term.

The experimental methods discussed include secretion assays using cultured cells. The materials used are cultured cells, possibly HEK293 or similar cell lines, but the exact name isn't specified. The readout type is quantitative, measuring the amount of secreted UCH-L1. The results indicate that D30K and I93M reduce secretion compared to wild-type, while C90S does not. The control would be wild-type UCH-L1. The study also mentions using Brefeldin A to inhibit vesicle transport, which suggests a control for the secretion pathway. However, the exact details on replicates, statistical methods, and thresholds aren't provided in the text, so I'll mark those as N.D.

I need to structure each experiment method entry. The first experiment involves comparing wild-type, D30K, C90S, and I93M. The second experiment involves a-synuclein mutants affecting UCH-L1 secretion. Each of these would be separate entries under Experiment Method.

For each variant in the Readout description, I need to list their effects. For example, D30K shows reduced secretion, C90S no change, I93M reduced, etc. The molecular effects would be partial loss-of-function for D30K and I93M, and no effect for C90S.

I also need to check if the methods are approved for studying Parkinson's. Secretion assays and vesicle transport inhibitors are standard in cell biology for studying protein secretion mechanisms, so "Approved assay" would be Yes.

Putting it all together, ensuring all fields are filled, and using N.D. where information is missing. Also, making sure the JSON structure is correct and all required fields are present.
