Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature abstract and introduction to extract the necessary information. The user wants me to act as a scientific literature miner and data standardization expert, focusing on genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods.

First, I need to identify the genetic variant mentioned in the context. The abstract mentions a "common LRRK2 missense variant, Gly2385Arg." So the gene here is LRRK2, and the variant is Gly2385Arg. The HGVS nomenclature is required, which involves the transcript, cDNA change, and protein change. However, the transcript number isn't provided in the text. The example uses NM_001126112.3, but since the actual transcript for LRRK2's Gly2385Arg isn't specified, I might need to note that as N.D. or use a placeholder. Wait, the user says to standardize via API. But without the specific transcript, maybe I should leave it as N.D. unless I can infer it. Alternatively, perhaps the example is just illustrative. I'll proceed with the information given.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease (PD). The MONDO database term for PD is MONDO:0005144. I'll need to confirm that. 

For the experimental methods, the abstract mentions a case-control study involving 989 Chinese subjects and transfection studies in human cell lines. The case-control study is a genotype frequency comparison, and the transfection studies involve localization and toxicity under oxidative stress. 

In the case-control study, the heterozygous Gly2385Arg genotype was associated with increased PD risk. The transfection study shows that the variant protein localizes to the cytoplasm, forms aggregates, and is more toxic under oxidative stress. 

Now, structuring the JSON. For the variants, the gene is LRRK2. The variant is Gly2385Arg. The protein change is from glycine (G) to arginine (R) at position 2385. The cDNA change would depend on the transcript. Since the text doesn't specify the transcript, I'll have to use N.D. for the transcript number. The HGVS would be something like NM_000240.4:c.7154G>A (assuming the position in the cDNA), but without the exact transcript, this might not be accurate. However, the example uses a placeholder, so perhaps I should use the information given and note that the transcript is N.D. 

For the disease, MONDO:0005144 is correct for Parkinson's disease. 

The experimental methods are the case-control study and the transfection studies. The case-control study is a genetic association study, and the transfection studies involve cell-based assays. 

In the transfection studies, the readout types might be qualitative and quantitative (e.g., localization, aggregate formation, apoptosis rate). The materials used are human cell lines. The controls would be wild-type and empty vector. 

Statistical analysis for the case-control study is mentioned as multivariate logistic regression and multivariate analysis, but the exact method isn't specified. For the transfection studies, it's not clear. 

Thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts might be based on typical cell biology standards. For example, normal localization might be cytoplasmic without aggregates, and abnormal would be increased aggregates or higher toxicity. 

Approved assays for PD might include cell-based assays for toxicity, which are commonly used. 

I need to make sure all the required fields are filled, even if some information is inferred or marked as N.D. Also, check the workflow steps to ensure each part is addressed.
