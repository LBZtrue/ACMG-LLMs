Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They want me to extract information from a provided scientific abstract about LRRK2 mutations and Parkinson's disease, then structure it into a specific JSON format. The key sections they need are variants, disease, and experimental methods.

First, I need to identify the genetic variants mentioned. The abstract talks about two pathogenic mutations: dLRRK(I1915T) and hLRRK2(G2019S). I'll have to convert these into HGVS nomenclature. However, the user mentioned standardizing via an API, which I can't actually do here, so I'll note that as N.D. for now. The protein changes are I1915T and G2019S. 

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for Parkinson's is MONDO:0004613. That's straightforward.

For the experimental methods, the abstract describes using a reporter system with let-7-binding sites in the 3'UTR. The methods include using Drosophila models, RNAi, and measuring EGFP expression. The readout is quantitative, based on reporter expression levels. The variants mentioned in the readout are the pathogenic ones, and the controls include wild-type proteins and RNAi. The abstract doesn't mention statistical methods or thresholds, so those will be N.D. 

I need to check if the experimental methods are approved for studying Parkinson's. Techniques like using reporter assays and RNAi are common in genetic studies, so I'll mark Approved assay as Yes. 

I'll structure all this into the JSON as per the template, making sure to include all required fields and use N.D. where information is missing. Let me double-check each section to ensure accuracy and completeness.
