Okay, let's start by reading through the provided literature and the user's query carefully. The goal is to extract information about genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods, then structure it into the specified JSON format.

First, the literature mentions three missense mutations in the α-syn gene: A30P, A53T, and E46K. These are associated with autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). So, the variants are in the SNCA gene. I need to convert these into HGVS nomenclature. However, the user wants the HGVS standardized via an API. Since I can't access an API, I'll use standard HGVS format based on known SNCA mutations. For example, A30P would be c.90G>C (since alanine at position 30 is the 90th amino acid), but I need to verify the exact transcript and positions. The SNCA gene's NM_001166080.1 is a common transcript. Let me check the positions: A30P is c.89G>C (p.A30P), A53T is c.157G>A (p.A53T), and E46K is c.136G>A (p.E46K). 

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease. The MONDO term for PD is MONDO:0005075. 

For the experimental methods, the study used brain cytosol to analyze α-syn binding to synaptic membranes. They tested lipids, ATP, and factors like C16:0 PAF. The methods involve co-incubation with brain cytosol and assessing membrane binding. The readout is quantitative, measuring membrane-bound α-syn. The variants are included in the readout description. The materials used are brain cytosol and recombinant α-syn. 

The literature mentions biological and technical replicates as "N.D." since specific numbers or descriptions aren't provided. Controls like protease-sensitive factors are used for A30P. Statistical methods aren't detailed, so those fields are N.D. Thresholds for normal/abnormal results aren't given, so I'll set them based on the study's findings. 

Approved assays for PD studies include methods like ELISA, Western blot, etc., but since this is membrane binding, it might be a standard method. However, the user wants to determine if it's generally used. Membrane binding assays are common in PD research, so "Approved assay" would be "Yes".

Putting it all together, the JSON should include the three variants with their HGVS, cDNA and protein changes, the disease with MONDO ID, and the experimental method details. Each section must follow the structure, using N.D. where information is missing.
