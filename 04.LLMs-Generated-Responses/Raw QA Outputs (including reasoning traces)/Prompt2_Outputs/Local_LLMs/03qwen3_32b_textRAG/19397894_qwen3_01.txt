Okay, let me start by reading through the provided literature abstract and introduction to identify the relevant information. The user wants me to extract genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods, structure them into JSON, and standardize the HGVS and MONDO terms.

First, the variants mentioned are I2020T and G2019S in the LRRK2 gene. I need to standardize their HGVS nomenclature. The problem is, the literature doesn't provide the exact transcript numbers, so I might need to look up the standard transcript for LRRK2. Let me check. The LRRK2 gene has several transcripts, but the most common is likely NM_004998.3. So, I'll use that as the transcript for both variants. For example, G2019S would be NM_004998.3:c.6056G>A, and I2020T would be NM_004998.3:c.6059T>C. However, I need to confirm this with an API or database. Since I can't access external resources, I'll proceed with this assumption but note that the transcript might need verification.

Next, the disease is Parkinson's disease (PD). The MONDO term for PD is MONDO:0012975. I need to ensure this is correct. Yes, MONDO:0012975 corresponds to Parkinson disease.

Now, the experimental methods. The literature mentions binding assays and in vitro kinase activity assays. For each method, I need to detail the material used, readout types, etc. The binding assays likely used LRRK2 protein variants, but the exact source isn't specified, so I'll use "N.D." for material source. The readout type is quantitative, as they measured ATP affinity. 

For the kinase activity assay, the material might be similar, but again, specifics are missing. The readout is quantitative, with ATP concentrations mentioned. The results indicate altered ATP affinity and resistance/sensitivity to inhibitors for each variant. 

Control settings: The literature refers to wild-type LRRK2 as a control, so basic positive and negative controls are present. However, details on replicates or statistical methods aren't provided, so those fields will be "N.D." 

Validation controls for pathogenic and benign variants aren't explicitly mentioned, so those counts remain "N.D." 

Thresholds for normal and abnormal results aren't specified in the literature, so I'll use standard thresholds based on common practices, noting the source as "Custom."

Approved assays: Both binding and kinase assays are standard for studying kinase activity in PD, so "Approved assay" is "Yes."

I need to structure all this into the JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled correctly. Variants are under LRRK2, disease is PD with MONDO term, and each experiment method has the required details. Missing information is marked as "N.D.".
