Explanation:
The provided literature focuses on the study of alpha-synuclein mutants (A30P, E46K, and A53T) and their potential role in Parkinson's disease (PD). The variants are described as p.A30P, p.E46K, and p.A53T, and the "Described Disease" is Parkinson's disease (PD) with MONDO term "MONDO:0007597." The experimental method mentioned in the literature is Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), though not specifically described as a functional experiment. The material used is purified alpha-synuclein mutants, which were expressed, purified, and spin-labeled with MTSSL. The readout type is spectroscopy, and the readout description is not mentioned in the literature, hence the "N.D." value. The biological and technical replicates, basic positive and negative controls, validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic and benign/likely benign variants, statistical analysis method, thresholds for normal and abnormal readout, and whether the assay is approved for studying PD are not mentioned in the literature and are therefore marked as "N.D." The extracted information is organized into the provided JSON format, with each field following the specified requirements and conventions, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the output data.
