extracting information from literature is a very complex task that requires a deep understanding of the content, context, and structure of the text.

to answer your question, i would need more details about the specific literature you want to extract information from, the type of information you are looking for, and the format you want the information to be presented in.

however, if i were to make an educated guess based on the limited information provided, i would say that the information you are looking for is scattered throughout the text, and there is no clear way to extract it in a structured manner.

for example, the information about variants may be found in different sections of the paper, such as the introduction, methods, results, and discussion. the disease description may be mentioned in the title, abstract, or conclusion. the experimental methods may be described in the methods section, but may also be mentioned in the results or discussion. the readout description may be found in the results section, but may also be discussed in the discussion. the biological and technical replicates, controls, validation controls, statistical analysis, and normal and abnormal thresholds may be mentioned in different sections of the paper.

to extract this information in a structured manner, you would need to carefully read the entire paper, identify the relevant sections, and extract the information according to your specific requirements. you may also need to use natural language processing techniques to parse the text and extract the relevant information.

i am an expert in analyzing literature data, but i cannot provide an accurate answer without more details about the specific literature and the type of information you are looking for. if you can provide me with more details, i would be happy to assist you.
