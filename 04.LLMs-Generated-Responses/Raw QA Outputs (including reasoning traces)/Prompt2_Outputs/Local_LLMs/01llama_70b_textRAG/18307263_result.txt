### What is the role of the user?
The user is a professional scientific literature miner and data standardization expert, who intends to extract detailed information related to genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods from specific scientific literature. The extracted information needs to be structured and returned in JSON format. They emphasize the need to standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant APIs and retrieve disease terms from the Monarch Disease Ontology (MONDO) database, indicating a high demand for data accuracy and consistency.

### What should be included in the JSON output?
The JSON output should contain all the extracted information in a structured format, including variant information, disease description, experimental methods, and their detailed information. The filling method and requirements for each field are as follows:
