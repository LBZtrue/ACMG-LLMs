Explanation:

- **Variants Include**:
  - The variant mentioned in the literature is in the PSEN1 gene, with HGVS nomenclature "NM_000021.4:c.224G>A", corresponding to the protein change "G75E".
- **Described Disease**:
  - The disease studied in the literature is "Alzheimer's disease", with the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0004971".
- **Experiment Method**:
  - The experimental method used in the literature is "Western Blot".
  - The material used in the experiment is "HEK293 cells".
  - The readout type is "Quantitative".
  - The conclusion of the readout description is "Abnormal".
  - The molecular effect is "Partial loss-of-function".
  - The result description is "The G75E variant showed reduced levels of mature PS1 protein compared to wild-type or other constructs.".
  - Biological and technical replicates were included in the experiment.
  - Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control, and empty vector was used as a negative control.
  - No validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic or benign/likely benign variants were mentioned in the literature.
  - ANOVA was used for statistical analysis of differences between different recombinant proteins.
  - The threshold for normal readout is protein expression greater than 80% of wild-type levels (determined based on literature content or your own knowledge).
  - The threshold for abnormal readout is protein expression less than 50% of wild-type levels (determined based on literature content or your own knowledge).
  - The experimental method used in the literature is generally used for studying Alzheimer's disease (based on your own knowledge).
