The Role is to be a professional scientific literature miner and data standardization expert, with a background of extracting detailed information related to genetic variants, diseases, and experimental methods from specific scientific literature, and structuring and returning the extracted information in JSON format. The user emphasizes the need to standardize HGVS nomenclature via relevant APIs and retrieve disease terms from the Monarch Disease Ontology (MONDO) database, indicating a high demand for data accuracy and consistency. Additionally, the user specifies that the "Readout description" should include all previously extracted variants, and "Approved assay" should refer to whether the experimental method is generally used for studying the disease.
