Explanation:

The input context mentions two DJ-1 variants, c.58_59delinsCT (p.L20S) and c.168C>T (p.L56F). However, the disease studied in the literature is not mentioned, so "N.D." is used for the "Described Disease" and "MONDO" fields.

The experiment method mentioned in the literature is the MTT assay, which is a quantitative assay. The material source is the cell line HEK-293T. Three biological replicates and triplicate technical replicates were performed. Wild-type DJ-1 was used as a positive control, and empty vector was used as a negative control. However, information on validation controls, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal/abnormal readouts are not mentioned in the literature, so "N.D." is used for these fields. The "Approved assay" field is also marked as "N.D." since the literature does not provide information on whether the MTT assay is generally used for studying the disease.
