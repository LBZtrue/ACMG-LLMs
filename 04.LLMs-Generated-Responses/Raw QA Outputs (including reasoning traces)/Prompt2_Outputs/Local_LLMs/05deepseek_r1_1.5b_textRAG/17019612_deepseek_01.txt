Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants a structured JSON response containing all relevant variant information, the described disease with MONDO terms, and details about each experimental method. 

First, I'll need to extract data from the literature as per the provided template. I should identify the variants mentioned, their HGVS names, cDNA changes, protein changes, and their descriptions in the input context. Then, I'll map the described disease to its corresponding MONDO term.

Next, for each experimental method identified, I have to gather detailed information. This includes the assay name, material used (like cell lines or animal models), readout type (qualitative or quantitative), the specific results for each variant, and details about biological, technical, basic positive/negative controls, validation controls P/LP and B/LB, thresholds, and whether the assay is generally used for studying the disease.

I also need to ensure that I standardize the HGVS nomenclature using relevant APIs and accurately retrieve disease terms from the MONDO database. All information must be in a JSON format adhering strictly to the provided structure.

Finally, I'll organize everything into the predefined JSON framework, making sure each section is clear and contains accurate data as per the user's specifications.
