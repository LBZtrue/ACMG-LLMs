Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to extract all relevant variant information from the literature provided and organize it in JSON format as per the user's instructions. 

First, I'll look at what's given in the context. The text mentions that mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene have been associated with recessive Parkinsonism. It talks about PINK1 being a SerThr protein kinase and provides some experimental results from two point mutations: G309D and L347P.

Now, the user has already outlined a JSON template they want to follow. The output needs to include:
- Variants Include
- Described Disease
- Experiment Method

Looking at the context, it mentions PINK1 kinase activity and expression levels in vitro and in mammalian cells. There's also some mention of L347P mutation destabilizing PINK1 and causing significant reduction in kinase activity, while G309D has more modest effects.

I need to structure this information into JSON. Let's break it down:

**Variants Include:** Here, I have two point mutations provided:
- G309D: Stable but localized; affects kinase activity.
- L347P: Present at appreciable carrier frequency in the Philippines; similarly affected.

So, I'll list these under the "variants" field with appropriate HGVS and cDNA changes.

**Described Disease:** The disease studied is recessive Parkinsonism. From the context, it refers to Parkinson's disease, specifically recessive form.

**Experiment Method:** This section lists all experimental methods mentioned. It includes:
- Western Blot
- Constructed using tags (e.g., tagged with myc or GFP at either end of the protein)

Looking back at the context, under "Experiment Method," it says "listed" but doesn't specify details beyond what's given. However, I'll make sure to include all available methods.

Wait, in the initial description, there's more about L347P mutation affecting localization and expression levels. So, I should add that information here as part of Experiment Method if possible. But since the user wants "Experiment Method" section with details, I need to ensure completeness.

In summary:
- Extract all variants (including HGVS, cDNA changes)
- Define described disease
- List each experiment method, including material used, readout types, result descriptions, etc.

I think that's it. Now, time to structure this into the JSON format as per the user's examples.
