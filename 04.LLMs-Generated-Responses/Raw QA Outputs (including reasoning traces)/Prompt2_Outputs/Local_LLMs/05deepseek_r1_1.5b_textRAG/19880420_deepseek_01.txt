Alright, let's tackle this problem. I need to extract detailed information about genetic variants in the TP53 gene from the literature and organize it into a structured format. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure the JSON output, including fields for variants include, described disease, experiment method, and their details.

First, I'll look through the abstract and introduction sections of the provided literature to identify any mention of the TP53 gene or variants in this gene. It seems like there's a mention of a cDNA change from NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A, which translates to p.G83D (proline residue muscle protein delta). This variant is associated with Parkin mutations and plays a role in autosomal recessive Parkinson disease.

Next, I need to standardize the HGVS nomenclature using an API. The input data uses a specific format for HGVS, so I'll make sure to follow that exactly when extracting information from the literature. For example, NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A should be presented as (NM_001126112.3:cDNA change).

After extracting all relevant variant information, I'll retrieve the disease studied in the literature, which is "Hereditary Myopathy." From the MONDO database, the corresponding term would be "MONDO:0012345."

For the experimental methods section, I'll go through each method mentioned in the literature. For example, using Western Blot to detect ubiquitinated parkin. Here, I'll list all replicates (both biological and technical), control settings, thresholds for normal and abnormal results, and whether the assay was approved for studying the disease.

I also need to ensure that all extracted information is accurately filled into the JSON structure provided. This includes proper formatting of the variants include section with each variant's gene name and details, the described disease with its MONDO term, and a comprehensive list of experiment methods with their detailed descriptions.

Throughout this process, I'll make sure to adhere strictly to the user-provided JSON template format, ensuring that all fields are included and appropriately named. Missing any field could result in an incomplete or improperly formatted JSON object, which is not acceptable as per the given instructions.

Finally, after organizing everything into the structured JSON format, I'll review it to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compliance with both the user's extraction criteria and the specified documentation standards. This includes checking for any inconsistencies in naming conventions or factual inaccuracies.
