Alright, I'm looking at this query from the user. They're asking for a deep dive into analyzing literature data to extract genetic variants, disease terms, and experimental methods. The JSON template is pretty detailed, so I need to make sure I structure my response correctly.

First off, they want me to standardize HGVS nomenclature using relevant APIs and retrieve disease terms from the MONDO database. That means I'll have to use specific tools or services for accurate naming and look up disease names if available.

Next, they specified how to organize the data. They provided a JSON template with sections like "Variants Include," "Described Disease," and "Experiment Method." Each of these needs detailed information that's structured properly. For example, under "Variants Include," I need to list each variant with its HGVS nomenclature, cDNA changes, and protein alterations.

I should also consider the constraints they mentioned. Strictly follow the JSON format and ensure all fields are filled out accurately. No empty cells unless explicitly indicated as N.D. So I'll make sure that every required section has entries, even if it's just a default value like "N.D."

Now, thinking about the process of extraction, I'll need to go through each scientific literature document they've provided and extract relevant information. This might involve reading multiple studies on Parkinson's disease to gather all variants found.

However, in this case, since the user didn't provide specific documents or references, I'm assuming they want me to outline the general approach. So I'll structure my answer based on the template they gave, focusing on the expected fields and what needs to be filled out.

Also, considering the workflow mentioned earlier, it seems like a systematic process. I should make sure each step is clearly explained, from literature extraction to standardization and validation of data.

I need to ensure that all terms are correctly labeled according to their disease. For example, if "Hereditary Myopathy" is the described disease, I'll use the corresponding MONDO term in the response.

Lastly, I should keep my answer organized and easy to follow, using clear headings for each section as specified. This will make it straightforward for the user to understand how they can apply this data in their own research or studies.
