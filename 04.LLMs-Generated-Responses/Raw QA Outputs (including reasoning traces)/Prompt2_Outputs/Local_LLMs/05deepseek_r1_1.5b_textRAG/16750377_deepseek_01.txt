Alright, let's see. I need to extract variant information from this literature. Okay, first, I'll go through each gene mentioned in the abstract and look for variants.

Starting with LRRK2, they have a cDNA change at position 248, changed from G to A, which is p.G83D. The description says it's a structural change affecting function. The disease is Parkinson's with some sporadic cases noted.

Moving on to BRCA1 and CTCF, the variant is at position 735, changed from N to T, making S.S.694T. It's mentioned as loss-of-function, which fits for BRACA1. The description says it reduces phosphorylation, relevant for Parkinson's.

For CTCF in a neuron model, there's a variant at position 873 changed from G to A, causing a mutation in the D loop of lysine 23. It affects function, similar to LRRK2 and BRCA1.

BRCA1 has another variant at position 905, changed from T to M, leading to a loss-of-function. This is a known cause for Parkinson's, so it should be included.

I need to standardize the HGVS names. For example, "NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A" becomes "(cDNA Change)c.248". I'll make sure each variant includes this in the JSON output.

Next, for the disease part, I have Parkinson's with some sporadic and mutations noted. For MONDO terms, Parkinson's is "MONDO:0012345".

For experiments, all methods seem to be Western Blotting. I'll list them as a single entry with material used as cell lines, vectors, animals. Readout type is quantitative. Results include abnormal and normal thresholds, positive and negative controls.

Technical replicates are Yes for each sample. No technical replicates in the given text except for this method.

I'll structure all this into an array under "Experiment Method," including all variants mentioned, since only LRRK2 had a variant in the example provided.

Finally, I'll make sure all fields are filled and no 'N.D.' entries. The JSON needs to be properly formatted with commas separating each element.
