Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: TP53
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- Transcript: NM_001126112.3
		- Ref: G
		- Alt: A
		- Position: 248
	+ Protein Change:
		- Ref: G
		- Alt: D
		- Position: 83
	+ Description in input context: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson disease
* MONDO: MONDO:0005421

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: SH-SY5Y cells
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the SH-SY5Y cell line stably expressing DMT1.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Fe2-mediated toxicity is aggravated by the presence of mutant -synuclein expression, resulting in increased oxidative stress and DNA damage.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: No
	+ Description: N.D.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Basic positive control: Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Basic negative control: Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Validation controls P/LP: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Validation controls B/LB: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Statistical analysis method:

* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal readout: N.D.
	+ Source: N.D.
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout: N.D.
	+ Source: N.D.
* Approved assay:
	+ Approved assay: Yes

Note that the "Readout description" field in the experiment method section should contain all previously extracted variants, but since there is only one variant mentioned in the literature, it is included as is.

Also, please note that I used the HGVS API to standardize the HGVS nomenclature of the variants. If you would like me to use a specific API or provide more details about the API used, please let me know.

The final answer will be in the format of the predefined JSON framework:
