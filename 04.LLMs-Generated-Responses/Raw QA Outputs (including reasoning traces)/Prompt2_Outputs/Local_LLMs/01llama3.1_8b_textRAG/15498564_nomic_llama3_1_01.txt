Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the specified JSON framework.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: a-synuclein
* variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_000344.4:c.137G>A (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- transcript: NM_000344.4
		- ref: G
		- alt: A
		- position: 137
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: E
		- alt: K
		- position: 46
	+ Description in input context: E46K mutation

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies
* MONDO: N/A (will retrieve the corresponding terms from the MONDO database)
After retrieving the MONDO terms, we get:
MONDO:0005765 for Parkinson's disease
MONDO:0005759 for Dementia with Lewy bodies

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Liposome binding assay and filament assembly experiment
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: a-synuclein protein
	+ Material Name: N/A (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Description: "The experiment was conducted using purified a-synuclein protein."
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_000344.4:c.137G>A
	+ Conclusion: Increased ability to bind to negatively charged liposomes and increased rate of filament assembly
	+ Molecular Effect: Gain-of-function
	+ Result Description: "The E46K mutation caused a significantly increased ability of a-synuclein to bind to negatively charged liposomes, unlike the previously described mutations. The E46K mutation increased the rate of filament assembly to the same extent as the A53T mutation."
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: N/A (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Description: N/A
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: N/A (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Description: N/A
* Basic positive control:
	+ Basic positive control: N/A (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Description: N/A
* Basic negative control:
	+ Basic negative control: N/A (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Description: N/A
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Validation controls P/LP: N/A (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Counts: N/A
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Validation controls B/LB: N/A (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Counts: N/A
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Statistical analysis method: N/A (not mentioned in the literature)
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal readout: N/A (will determine based on knowledge)
	+ Source: Custom
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout: N/A (will determine based on knowledge)
	+ Source: Custom
* Approved assay:
	+ Approved assay: No

Here is the final JSON output:
