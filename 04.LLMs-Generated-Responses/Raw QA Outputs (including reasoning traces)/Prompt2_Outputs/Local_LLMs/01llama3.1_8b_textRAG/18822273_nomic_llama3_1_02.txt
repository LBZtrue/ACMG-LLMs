Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: DJ-1
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_014109.5:c.488G>A (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- Transcript: NM_014109.5
		- Ref: G
		- Alt: A
		- Position: 488
	+ Protein Change:
		- Ref: R
		- Alt: K
		- Position: 163
	+ Description in input context: E163K

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson's disease
* MONDO: PARK7 (DJ-1) is associated with autosomal recessive PD, which contributes to 1-2% of early onset PD cases.

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: N.D. (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Description: N.D.
* Readout type: Qualitative
* Readout description: [Note: This descriptions should contain all the variants mentioned in Variants Include section]
	+ Variant: NM_014109.5:c.488G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal (loss of antioxidant function)
	+ Molecular Effect: loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: The E163K mutant loses the ability to protect against oxidative stress.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: N.D.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: No (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Description: N.D.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Basic positive control: Yes (wild-type DJ-1 protein was used as a positive control)
	+ Description: Wild-type DJ-1 protein was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Basic negative control: No (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Description: N.D.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Validation controls P/LP: Yes
	+ Counts: 2 (mutations in PARK7, including truncation, missense, splice-site, and large deletions)
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Validation controls B/LB: No (not mentioned in the literature)
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Statistical analysis method: N.D. (not mentioned in the literature)
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal readout: N.D. (not described in the literature)
	+ Source: N.D.
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout: N.D. (not described in the literature)
	+ Source: N.D.
* Approved assay:
	+ Approved assay: No (the experimental method is not generally used for studying Parkinson's disease)

The final JSON output will be:
