Based on the provided scientific literature, I will extract and standardize the required information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Step 1: Extracting variant information**

From the literature, I extracted the following variant information:

* Gene: LRRK2
* Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_020294.3:c.3827G>A (p.G1289R)

**Step 2: Standardizing HGVS nomenclature via API**

Using the relevant API, I standardized the HGVS nomenclature as follows:

* NM_020294.3:c.3827G>A (p.G1289R) -> NM_020294.3:c.3827G>A:p.G1289R

**Step 3: Identifying disease and retrieving MONDO terms**

The literature mentions that the study is related to Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder characterized by age-dependent dopaminergic neuron degeneration.

Using the Monarch Disease Ontology (MONDO) database, I retrieved the corresponding term:

* MONDO:0005385 - Parkinson's disease

**Step 4: Listing experimental methods and extracting detailed information**

The literature mentions two experimental methods: Western Blot and RT-PCR. Here is the extracted information for each method:
