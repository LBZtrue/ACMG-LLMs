Based on the provided scientific literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: PINK1
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_006403.4:c.723G>A (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- transcript: NM_006403.4
		- ref: G
		- alt: A
		- position: 723
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: E241K
		- alt: K
		- position: 241
	+ Description in input context: p.E241K (NM_006403.4:c.723G>A)

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Late Onset Sporadic Parkinson’s Disease
* MONDO: Not found in the literature, so I will use "N.D." to indicate

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: TUNEL assay (not approved for this disease)
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Patients Derived Material
	+ Material Name: N.D.
	+ Description: N.D.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_006403.4:c.723G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: complete loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: The variant NM_006403.4:c.723G>A was found to abolish the protective effect of wild-type PINK1 against staurosporine-induced apoptosis.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: N.D.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: No
	+ Description: N.D.
