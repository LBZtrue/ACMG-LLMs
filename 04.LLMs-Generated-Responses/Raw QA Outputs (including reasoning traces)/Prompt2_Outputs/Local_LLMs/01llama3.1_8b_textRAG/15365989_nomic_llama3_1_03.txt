Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Note: Since the MONDO term was not provided in the literature, I left it as "N.D." (Not Defined). Also, some of the sections like "Basic positive control", "Basic negative control", "Validation controls P/LP" and "Validation controls B/LB" were not mentioned in the literature, so they are also marked as "No" or "N.D.".
