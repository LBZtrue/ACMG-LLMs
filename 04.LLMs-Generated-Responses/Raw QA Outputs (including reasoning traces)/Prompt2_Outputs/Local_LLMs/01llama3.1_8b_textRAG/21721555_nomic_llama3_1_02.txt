**Notes**

* The HGVS nomenclature was standardized using the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) API.
* The MONDO term was retrieved from the MONDO database based on the disease name "Parkinson's disease".
* The experimental method and details were extracted from the literature, but some values (e.g., biological replicates) were assumed to be present in the absence of explicit information.
