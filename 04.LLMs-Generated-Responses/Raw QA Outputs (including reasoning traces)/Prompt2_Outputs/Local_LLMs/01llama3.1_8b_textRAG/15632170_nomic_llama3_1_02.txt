**Explanation:**

* The literature mentions a variant in the SNCA gene, c.137G>A (p.E46K), described as "This variant causes an increase in amyloid fibril formation."
* The disease studied is not explicitly mentioned in the literature.
* I used the MONDO term "N.D." to indicate that no corresponding term was found for the disease studied.
* The experimental method used is Western Blot, with material source being a cell line (HEK293), and readout type being quantitative.
* For each variant, I described the conclusion as "Abnormal" due to increased amyloid fibril formation, with molecular effect as "partial loss-of-function".
* Biological replicates were performed (three biological replicates), technical replicates were also performed (each sample was run in triplicate), basic positive control and negative control were set up, and validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were included.
* The statistical analysis method used was ANOVA.
