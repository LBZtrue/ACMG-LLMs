Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the specified JSON format.

**Variants Include**

*   Gene: LRRK2
*   Variants:

    *   HGVS: NM_024415.5:c.5451C>T (standardized via API)
    *   cDNA Change:
        *   Transcript: NM_024415.5
        *   Ref: C
        *   Alt: T
        *   Position: 5451
    *   Protein Change:
        *   Ref: L
        *   Alt: S
        *   Position: 1820
    *   Description in input context: "c.5451C>T (p.L1820S)"

**Described Disease**

*   Described Disease: Parkinson's disease
*   MONDO: Mondo ID for Parkinson's disease, not provided in the literature

**Experiment Method**

*   Assay Method: Cell viability assay
*   Material used:
    *   Material Source: Cell line
    *   Material Name: HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells
    *   Description: "The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cell lines."
*   Readout type: Quantitative
*   Readout description:
    *   Variant: NM_024415.5:c.5451C>T (p.L1820S)
    *   Conclusion: Normal for wild-type LRRK2, Abnormal for Y1699C and G2019S mutants
    *   Molecular Effect: Wild-type LRRK2 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress, while mutants reduce it
    *   Result Description:
        + For wild-type LRRK2: "The results showed that cells expressing wild-type LRRK2 had increased tolerance to H2O2-induced oxidative stress compared to cells expressing Y1699C or G2019S mutants."
        + For Y1699C and G2019S mutants: "In contrast, cells expressing Y1699C or G2019S mutants showed reduced tolerance to H2O2-induced oxidative stress compared to wild-type LRRK2-expressing cells."

**Biological replicates**

*   Biological replicates: Yes
*   Description: "Three biological replicates were performed for each experimental group."

**Technical replicates**

*   Technical replicates: No
*   Description: Not mentioned in the literature

**Basic positive control**

*   Basic positive control: Wild-type LRRK2
*   Description: "Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control."

**Basic negative control**

*   Basic negative control: Empty vector
*   Description: "Empty vector was used as a negative control."

**Validation controls P/LP**

*   Validation controls P/LP: Yes
*   Counts: Not specified

**Validation controls B/LB**

*   Validation controls B/LB: No
*   Counts: Not applicable

**Statistical analysis method**

*   Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis, but not explicitly mentioned in the literature.

**Threshold for normal readout**

*   Threshold for normal readout: Not specified
*   Source: Literature

**Threshold for abnormal readout**

*   Threshold for abnormal readout: Not specified
*   Source: Literature

**Approved assay**

*   Approved assay: No, as the experimental protocol is not specifically designed to study Parkinson's disease but rather the effects of LRRK2 variants on cell viability.
