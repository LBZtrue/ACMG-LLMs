Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the specified JSON format.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: PARK2
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_004009.3:c.1426C>T (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- Transcript: NM_004009.3
		- Ref: C
		- Alt: T
		- Position: 1426
	+ Protein Change:
		- Ref: L
		- Alt: F
		- Position: 452
	+ Description in input context: c.1426C>T (p.L452F)

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson's disease
* MONDO: MONDO:0005557

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Electron microscopy
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: HEK293
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
* Readout type: Qualitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_004009.3:c.1426C>T
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: dominant-negative
	+ Result Description: "The mutant protein showed a significant change in structure and aggregation compared to wild-type."
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: Three biological replicates were performed.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: Yes
	+ Description: Each sample was run in triplicate.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Basic positive control: Yes
	+ Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Basic negative control: Yes
	+ Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Validation controls P/LP: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Validation controls B/LB: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Statistical analysis method: N.D.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal readout: N.D.
	+ Source: N.D.
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout: N.D.
	+ Source: N.D.
* Approved assay:
	+ Approved assay: No

Note that the "Validation controls P/LP" and "Validation controls B/LB" fields are not applicable in this case, as there is no mention of validation controls for pathogenic or benign variants. Similarly, the "Statistical analysis method", "Threshold for normal readout", and "Threshold for abnormal readout" fields do not have any information provided in the literature.

The final JSON output will be:
