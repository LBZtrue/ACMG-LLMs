Please note that I've assumed the standardized HGVS nomenclature for each variant based on the provided information. If the actual standardized HGVS nomenclature differs from what I've used, please correct it accordingly.

Additionally, some fields (e.g., "Protein Change" for cDNA variations NM_007334.3:c.78T>I and NM_007334.3:c.442G>A) are not provided in the literature. In such cases, I've filled them with "N.D." to indicate that the information is not available.

Please review the extracted information carefully to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
