Please note that some information, such as the material source and description of biological replicates, were not mentioned in the literature. Therefore, I have left them blank or provided a default value ("n/a") to indicate that this information was not available.

Also, please note that the "Approved assay" field is marked as "No", since the experimental protocol used in the literature is not generally recognized for studying Parkinson disease.
