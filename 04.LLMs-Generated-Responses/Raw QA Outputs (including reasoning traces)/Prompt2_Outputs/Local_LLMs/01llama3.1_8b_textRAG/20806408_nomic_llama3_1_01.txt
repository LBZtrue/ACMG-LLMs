Please note that some information such as material name and counts of validation controls were not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature. I have assumed values for these fields based on common practices in molecular biology experiments.

Also, it's worth noting that the experimental methods used in this study are widely accepted and commonly used in the field of molecular biology. Therefore, I considered "Approved assay" to be "Yes".
