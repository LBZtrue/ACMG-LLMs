Please note that the information is extracted from the literature and may not be comprehensive. Additional details or clarification may be required to accurately fill in all fields of the JSON framework.

**Explanation:**

* The variant NM_015683.3:c.488G>A (p.E163K) was identified as the E163K mutant, which loses its ability to protect against oxidative stress.
* Parkinson's disease (PD) is the disease being studied, and the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0005481" was retrieved from the database.
* The experimental method used is Western Blot, but the specific details about the material, biological replicates, technical replicates, validation controls, and statistical analysis are not mentioned in the literature. Therefore, these fields are left blank (N.D.) or empty for now.
* The threshold for normal readout, threshold for abnormal readout, and approved assay fields are also left blank or empty as they were not specified in the literature.

If you need further clarification or have additional information to provide, please let me know!
