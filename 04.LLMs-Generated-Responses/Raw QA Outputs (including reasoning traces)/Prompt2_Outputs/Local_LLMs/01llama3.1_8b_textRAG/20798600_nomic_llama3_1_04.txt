	+ Description in input context: c.248G>A (p.G83D)

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson disease (PD)
* MONDO: MONDO:0005412

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells
	+ Description: "Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and analyzed for PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy."
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_001126112.3:c.248G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: "The variant caused a significant reduction in PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, consistent with previous studies."
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: "Three biological replicates were performed to confirm the results."
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: No
	+ Description: N.D.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Basic positive control: Yes
	+ Description: "Wild-type PINK1 and Parkin constructs were used as positive controls."
* Basic negative control:
	+ Basic negative control: Yes
	+ Description: "Empty vector was used as a negative control."
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Validation controls P/LP: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Validation controls B/LB: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Statistical analysis method: ANOVA was used for statistical analysis.

	+ Threshold for normal readout: N.D.
	+ Source: N.D.
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout: N.D.
	+ Source: N.D.
* Approved assay:
	+ Approved assay: No (PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy is not typically used to study PD)
