Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the relevant information according to the predefined JSON framework. Here is the extracted information in JSON format:

Note: The information in the literature does not provide specific details on the thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts, so I have left those fields as "N/A". Additionally, since this is a research article, it may not be a traditional "approved" assay, but rather an experimental protocol.
