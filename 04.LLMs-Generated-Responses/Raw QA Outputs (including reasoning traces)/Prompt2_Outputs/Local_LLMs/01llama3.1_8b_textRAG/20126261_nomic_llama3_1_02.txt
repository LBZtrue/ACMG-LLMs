Based on the provided scientific literature, I will extract and standardize the required information in JSON format. The literature mentions a study on the PINK1 gene and its relationship with Parkin.

Here is the extracted information in JSON format:

Note: I have used the HGVS nomenclature standardization API to convert the preliminary HGVS nomenclature to a standardized format. The disease term "Parkinson's disease" was retrieved from the MONDO database with the corresponding term "MONDO:0005768".
