Note: The HGVS nomenclature was standardized using the relevant API, and the MONDO term was retrieved from the database. The experimental method is described as Western Blot, with HEK293 cells used as material. The variant NM_004800:c.1585delT had an abnormal result, indicating complete loss-of-function.
