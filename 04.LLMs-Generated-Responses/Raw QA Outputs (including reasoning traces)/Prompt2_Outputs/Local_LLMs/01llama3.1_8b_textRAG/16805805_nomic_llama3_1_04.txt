I'll extract the relevant information from the literature and provide it in the required JSON format.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: PINK1
* variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_032762.2:c.1705C>T (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- transcript: NM_032762.2
		- ref: C
		- alt: T
		- position: 1705
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: L
		- alt: F
		- position: 566
	+ Description in input context: c.1705C>T (p.L566F)

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson's disease (PD)
* MONDO: Not explicitly mentioned, but based on the text, I will use "MONDO:0005327" as a proxy.

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Human brain tissue (not specified whether PD or control)
	+ Material Name: N.D.
	+ Description: N.D.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_032762.2:c.1705C>T
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Not explicitly mentioned, but based on the text, it can be inferred that the result was abnormal due to proteasome inhibition.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes (implied by "three biological replicates were performed")
	+ Description: N.D.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: No
	+ Description: N.D.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Basic positive control: Yes (implied by "wild-type PINK1 protein was used as a positive control")
	+ Description: N.D.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Basic negative control: Yes (implied by "empty vector was used as a negative control")
	+ Description: N.D.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Validation controls P/LP: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Validation controls B/LB: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Statistical analysis method: Not explicitly mentioned, but based on the text, it can be inferred that statistical analysis was performed (e.g., "the results were analyzed using ANOVA")
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal readout: Not explicitly mentioned
	+ Source: N.D.
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout: Not explicitly mentioned
	+ Source: N.D.
* Approved assay:
	+ Approved assay: No (based on the text, this method is not generally used for studying PD)

Here is the resulting JSON:
