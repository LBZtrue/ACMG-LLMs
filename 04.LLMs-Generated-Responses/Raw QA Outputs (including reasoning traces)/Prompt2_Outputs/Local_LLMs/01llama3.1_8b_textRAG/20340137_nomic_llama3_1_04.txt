Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the relevant information according to the specified JSON format.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: SNCA
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_000345.6:c.158C>T (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- Transcript: NM_000345.6
		- Ref: C
		- Alt: T
		- Position: 158
	+ Protein Change:
		- Ref: H
		- Alt: Y
		- Position: 53
	+ Description in input context: p.Ala53Thr

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson's Disease (PD)
* MONDO: MONDO:0005664 (retrieved from MONDO database)

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Allelic imbalance of expression and epigenetic regulation
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Lymphoblastoid cell line and patient-derived blood cells
	+ Material Name: N.D.
	+ Description: N.D.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_000345.6:c.158C>T
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal (silencing of the mutated allele)
	+ Molecular Effect: Partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: The study found that the p.Ala53Thr allele was silenced, leading to an imbalance in SNCA expression.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: N.D.
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: N.D.
* Basic positive control:
	+ Basic positive control: No
	+ Description: N.D.
* Basic negative control:
	+ Basic negative control: No
	+ Description: N.D.
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Validation controls P/LP: Yes
	+ Counts: 1 (silencing of the mutated allele)
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Validation controls B/LB: No
	+ Counts: 0
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Statistical analysis method: N.D.
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal readout: N.D.
	+ Source: N.D.
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout: N.D.
	+ Source: N.D.
* Approved assay:
	+ Approved assay: Yes (the experimental method is generally used for studying PD)
