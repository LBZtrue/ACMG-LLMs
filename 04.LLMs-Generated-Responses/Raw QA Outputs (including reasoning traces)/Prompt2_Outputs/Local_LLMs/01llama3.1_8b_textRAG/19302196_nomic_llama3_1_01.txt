Note: I have only included one variant in the `Variants Include` section, as the literature mentions only one specific mutation. If there are multiple variants mentioned in the literature, they should be included in this section.

Also, please note that some fields may not have a description or value (e.g., "Basic positive control") because I could not find any information about them in the provided text.
