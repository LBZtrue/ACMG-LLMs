Based on the provided scientific literature, I will extract and standardize the required information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: Alpha-synuclein (α-syn)
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_000343.5:c.1069A>C (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- Transcript: NM_000343.5
		- Ref: A
		- Alt: C
		- Position: 1069
	+ Protein Change:
		- Ref: Ile
		- Alt: Thr
		- Position: 356
	+ Description in input context: NM_000343.5:c.1069A>C (p.Ile356Thr)

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson's disease (PD)
* MONDO: MONDO:0010931

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Inducible model of α-syn expression in rat PC12/TetOn cells
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line
	+ Material Name: PC12/TetOn cells
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using the inducible model of α-syn expression in rat PC12/TetOn cells.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_000343.5:c.1069A>C
	+ Conclusion: No aggregation and cell death were present for both WT and mutated protein
	+ Molecular Effect: N.D.
	+ Result Description: The results showed that α-syn did not accumulate at high expression level, but its antioxidant function was no longer detectable for the A30P form.

**Biological replicates**

* Biological replicates: Yes
* Description: The experiment was conducted using three biological replicates.

**Technical replicates**

* Technical replicates: No
* Description: N.D.

**Basic positive control**

* Basic positive control: Yes
* Description: Wild-type cDNA was used as a positive control.

**Basic negative control**

* Basic negative control: Yes
* Description: Empty vector was used as a negative control.

**Validation controls P/LP**

* Validation controls P/LP: No
* Counts: N.D.

**Validation controls B/LB**

* Validation controls B/LB: No
* Counts: N.D.

**Statistical analysis method**

* Statistical analysis method: N.D.

**Threshold for normal readout**

* Threshold for normal readout: N.D.
* Source: Literature

**Threshold for abnormal readout**

* Threshold for abnormal readout: N.D.
* Source: Literature

**Approved assay**

* Approved assay: No
* Reason: The experimental protocol used in the literature is not generally used for studying Parkinson's disease.
