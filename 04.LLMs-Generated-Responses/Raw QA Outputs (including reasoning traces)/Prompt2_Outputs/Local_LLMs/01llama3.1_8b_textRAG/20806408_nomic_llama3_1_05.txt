Please note that the MONDO term and the thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts are not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature, hence they have been marked as N.D. (Not Determined) or N.A. (Not Applicable). Additionally, the statistical analysis method used is only mentioned briefly without specifying which statistical test was employed.
