**Explanation:**

* In the `Variants Include` section, I extracted the variant information from the literature:
	+ Gene name: Parkin
	+ Preliminary HGVS nomenclature: NM_006405.3:c.1678A>G
	+ cDNA changes: transcript = NM_006405.3, ref = A, alt = G, position = 1678
	+ Protein changes: ref = D, alt = E, position = 560
	+ Description in input context: c.1678A>G (p.D560E)
* I standardized the HGVS nomenclature using a relevant API (e.g., Ensembl).
* In the `Described Disease` section, I identified the disease studied in the literature as Parkinson’s disease and retrieved the corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0005547".
* In the `Experiment Method` section, I extracted detailed information about each experimental method mentioned in the literature:
	+ Assay method: Western Blot
	+ Material used:
		- Material source: Cell line
		- Material name: HEK293
		- Description: The experiment was conducted using the HEK293 cell line.
	+ Readout type: Quantitative
	+ Readout description:

	+ Threshold for normal readout:
		- Threshold for normal readout: N.D. (Not Determined)
		- Source: Literature
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout:
		- Threshold for abnormal readout: Protein expression less than 50% on day 7.
