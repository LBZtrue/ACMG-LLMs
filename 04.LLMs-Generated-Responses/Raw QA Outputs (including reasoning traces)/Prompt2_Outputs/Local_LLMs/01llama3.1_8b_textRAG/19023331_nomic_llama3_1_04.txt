**Note:**

* The HGVS nomenclature was standardized using the relevant API (e.g., Ensembl, NCBI).
* The disease studied is Parkinson's disease (PD), with its corresponding MONDO term "MONDO:0005332".
* For the experimental method, I assumed that yeast two-hybrid screening is a commonly used assay for detecting protein interactions.
* Since the literature does not provide explicit information on biological and technical replicates, control settings, statistical analysis methods, and thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts, I provided "N.D." (Not Described) or left them blank accordingly.
