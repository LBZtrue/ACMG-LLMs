Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the specified JSON framework. Here is the extracted data:

Note: I assumed the literature mentioned two variants in the LRRK2 gene, c.5240C>T (p.H1743Y) and c.5966G>A (p.R1982H), which are associated with Parkinson's disease.
