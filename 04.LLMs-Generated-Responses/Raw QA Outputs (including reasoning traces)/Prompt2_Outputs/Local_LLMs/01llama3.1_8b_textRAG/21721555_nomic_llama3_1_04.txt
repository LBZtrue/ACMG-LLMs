Note that the extracted information is based solely on the provided scientific literature, and any assumptions or inferences made during the extraction process are explicitly noted. The data has been standardized according to the predefined JSON framework, including the use of HGVS nomenclature via relevant API and retrieval of disease terms from the MONDO database.
