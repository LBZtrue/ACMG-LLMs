Based on the provided scientific literature, I will extract and standardize the required information according to the specified JSON format. Here is the answer:

}
```

Note that I have used some of the information provided in the literature and made assumptions where necessary. The answers to some questions, such as the validation controls P/LP or B/LB, were not described in the literature, so I left them as "N.D."
