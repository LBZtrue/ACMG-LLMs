Please note that the material source and name are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. I have assumed a cell line as the material source, but please verify this information with the original publication.

Also, the validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and benign/likely benign variants are not mentioned in the literature. I have set these values to "No" and "N.D." respectively.

The statistical analysis method is mentioned in the literature as ANOVA. The thresholds for normal and abnormal readouts are determined based on the information provided in the literature.

Lastly, the approved assay value is set to "No", indicating that the experimental protocol used in the literature is not generally used for studying Parkinson's disease.
