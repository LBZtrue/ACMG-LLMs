Based on the provided scientific literature, I will extract and structure the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Here is the extracted information:

Note: I used the standardized HGVS nomenclature provided by the HGVS database (https://varsome.com/) for the variants. If you have any specific requirements or preferences regarding the nomenclature, please let me know.

Also, please note that some fields in the JSON structure might not be applicable to this specific literature example. I've included them as placeholders for potential future use cases.
