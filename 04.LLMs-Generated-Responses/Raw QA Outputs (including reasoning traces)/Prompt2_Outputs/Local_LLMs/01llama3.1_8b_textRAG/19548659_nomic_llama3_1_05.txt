**Additional information**

* The literature mentions three variants in the R-synuclein gene (SNCA): c.175C>T, c.198G>A, and c.245A>G. However, only the variant NM_001154:c.175C>T is mentioned as having an intermediate effect on Cu(II) binding.
* The experiment used recombinant human R-synuclein protein and was performed in triplicate.

Note: Some fields may have N.D. (Not Determined) values due to the lack of information in the literature.
