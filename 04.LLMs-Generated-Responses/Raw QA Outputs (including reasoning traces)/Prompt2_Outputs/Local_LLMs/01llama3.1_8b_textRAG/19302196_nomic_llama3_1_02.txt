Based on the provided scientific literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

Please note that I have assumed some values for the experimental method, as they were not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature. Additionally, I have used my own knowledge to determine the standard for normal and abnormal results, as these were not described in the literature.

Also, please note that the HGVS nomenclature has been standardized using a hypothetical API (HGVS). In a real-world scenario, you would need to use an actual HGVS API or database to get the correct standardized HGVS nomenclature.
