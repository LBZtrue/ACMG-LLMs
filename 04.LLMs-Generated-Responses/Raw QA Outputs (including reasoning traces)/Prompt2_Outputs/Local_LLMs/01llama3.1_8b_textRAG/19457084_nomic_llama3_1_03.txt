Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework. Here is the extracted and standardized information:

Note that I have used the preliminary HGVS nomenclature mentioned in the literature, which is NM_002046.4:c.491C>A. However, this may not be standardized according to the provided API. To standardize it, you would need to use a relevant API such as Ensembl or RefSeq.

Also, I have set the "Validation controls P/LP" to "No", since there is no mention of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant validation in the literature.
