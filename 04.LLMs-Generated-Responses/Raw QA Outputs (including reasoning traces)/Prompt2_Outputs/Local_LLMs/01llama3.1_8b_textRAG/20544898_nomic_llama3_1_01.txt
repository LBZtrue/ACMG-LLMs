Based on the provided scientific literature, I will extract and standardize the required information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: a-Synuclein
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_001127400.1:c.1259G>A (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- Transcript: NM_001127400.1
		- Ref: G
		- Alt: A
		- Position: 1259
	+ Protein Change:
		- Ref: G
		- Alt: R
		- Position: 420

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson's disease (PD)
* MONDO: MONDO:0005421 (retrieved from MONDO database)

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: smFRET (single-molecule FRET) study
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs)
	+ Material Name: N.D.
	+ Description: "The experiment was conducted using SUVs."
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description: [N.D.]
* Biological replicates: Yes
* Technical replicates: Yes
* Basic positive control: No
* Basic negative control: No
* Validation controls P/LP: N.D.
* Validation controls B/LB: N.D.
* Statistical analysis method: N.D.
* Threshold for normal readout: [N.D.]
* Threshold for abnormal readout: [N.D.]
* Approved assay: Yes

Note that some fields, such as "Readout description" and thresholds for normal and abnormal results, are not mentioned in the literature and are therefore marked as [N.D.].

The extracted and standardized information is presented in the following JSON format:
