Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the relevant information according to the specified JSON framework.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: DJ-1
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_138734.4:c.176C>T (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- Transcript: NM_138734.4
		- Ref: C
		- Alt: T
		- Position: 176
	+ Protein Change:
		- Ref: H
		- Alt: Y
		- Position: 59
	+ Description in input context: c.176C>T (p.H59Y)

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Early-Onset Parkinsonism
* MONDO: Not mentioned in the literature, so I will use "N.D."

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Not explicitly mentioned in the literature, so I will use "N.D."
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Bacteria (D. radiodurans)
	+ Material Name: D. radiodurans
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using bacteria exposed to high extracellular concentrations of Mn2.
* Readout type: Not explicitly mentioned in the literature, so I will use "N.D."
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_138734.4:c.176C>T
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal (due to impaired radioresistance)
	+ Molecular Effect: N.D.
	+ Result Description: The bacteria exposed to 100 M Mn2 appeared as aggregates of noncompartmentalized, fully separated bacteria, within which DNA toroids could no longer be detected, revealing a dispersed nucleoid structure.

**Biological and Technical Replicates**

* Biological replicates: Not explicitly mentioned in the literature, so I will use "N.D."
* Description: N.D.
* Technical replicates: Not explicitly mentioned in the literature, so I will use "N.D."

**Control Settings**

* Basic positive control: Not explicitly mentioned in the literature, so I will use "N.D."
* Basic negative control: Not explicitly mentioned in the literature, so I will use "N.D."

**Validation Controls**

* Validation controls P/LP: Not explicitly mentioned in the literature, so I will use "N.D."
* Counts: N.D.

**Statistical Analysis Method**

* Statistical analysis method: Not explicitly mentioned in the literature, so I will use "N.D."

**Thresholds for Normal and Abnormal Readouts**

* Threshold for normal readout: N.D.
* Source: N.D.
* Threshold for abnormal readout: N.D.
* Source: N.D.

**Approved Assay**

* Approved assay: N.D. (since the experimental protocol is not explicitly mentioned in the literature)
