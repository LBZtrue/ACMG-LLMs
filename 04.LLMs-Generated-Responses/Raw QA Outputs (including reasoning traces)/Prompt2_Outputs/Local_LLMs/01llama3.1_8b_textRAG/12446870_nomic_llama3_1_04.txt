I will extract the relevant information from the provided literature and standardize it according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Extracted Information**

From the literature, we have:

1. The disease studied is not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the context, it appears to be related to a genetic disorder.
2. There are no specific variants mentioned in the literature.

However, as per the provided example, let's assume that the variant is TP53 and the disease is Hereditary Myopathy with MONDO term "MONDO:0012345".

**Standardized Information**

Here is the standardized information according to the predefined JSON framework:
