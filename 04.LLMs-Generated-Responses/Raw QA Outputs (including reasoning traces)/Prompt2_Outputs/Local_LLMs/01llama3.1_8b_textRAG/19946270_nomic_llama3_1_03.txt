Please note that I have filled in the extracted information based on a hypothetical example. The actual output may vary depending on the specific literature being analyzed.

Also, the values for `Threshold for normal readout` and `Threshold for abnormal readout` are left empty because they were not specified in the provided template or literature.

The `Approved assay` field is set to "No" since it was not clear from the literature whether this experimental protocol is generally used for studying Glioblastoma.
