Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: LRRK2
* variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_024415.3:c.4605G>A (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- transcript: NM_024415.3
		- ref: G
		- alt: A
		- position: 4605
	+ Protein Change:
		- ref: G
		- alt: E
		- position: 1529 (Note: The protein change is based on the assumption that the HGVS nomenclature corresponds to a specific transcript and amino acid position. This may require further analysis or clarification.)
	+ Description in input context: c.4605G>A (p.E1529E)

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson's disease
* MONDO: PARK8 (retrieved from MONDO database)

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: In vitro kinase assay with recombinant proteins
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Recombinant LRRK2 and Akt1 proteins
	+ Material Name: N.D.
	+ Description: The experiment was conducted using recombinant LRRK2 and Akt1 proteins in an in vitro setting.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description: Phosphorylation of Akt1 by LRRK2 (Note: This is based on the experimental design, where the readout is the phosphorylation of Akt1.)
	+ Variant: NM_024415.3:c.4605G>A
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal (i.e., impaired phosphorylation)
	+ Molecular Effect: Impaired kinase activity
	+ Result Description: The experiment demonstrated that LRRK2 directly phosphorylates Akt1, with a reduced interaction and phosphorylation observed in disease-associated mutations R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T.
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes
	+ Description: N.D. (no specific information provided)
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: No
	+ Description: N.D. (no specific information provided)
* Basic positive control:
	+ Basic positive control: No
	+ Description: N.D. (no specific information provided)
* Basic negative control:
	+ Basic negative control: No
	+ Description: N.D. (no specific information provided)
* Validation controls P/LP:
	+ Validation controls P/LP: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Validation controls B/LB:
	+ Validation controls B/LB: No
	+ Counts: N.D.
* Statistical analysis method:
	+ Statistical analysis method: N.D. (no specific information provided)
* Threshold for normal readout:
	+ Threshold for normal readout: N.D. (no specific information provided)
	+ Source: Literature
* Threshold for abnormal readout:
	+ Threshold for abnormal readout: N.D. (no specific information provided)
	+ Source: Literature
* Approved assay:
	+ Approved assay: Yes (based on the experimental design, which is a well-established method in the field)
