			- Result Description: Not specified in the literature
* Biological replicates:
	+ Biological replicates: Yes or No (not explicitly mentioned, but inferred from the context)
	+ Description: Not specified
* Technical replicates:
	+ Technical replicates: Yes or No (not explicitly mentioned, but inferred from the context)
	+ Description: Not specified
