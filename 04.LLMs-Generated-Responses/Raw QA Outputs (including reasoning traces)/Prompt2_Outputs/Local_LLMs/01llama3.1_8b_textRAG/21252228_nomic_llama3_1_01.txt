Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the specified JSON format.

**Variants Include**
```json
"Variants Include": [
  {
    "Gene": "SNCA",
    "variants": [
      {
        "HGVS": "NM_000345.3:c.1407C>A",
        "cDNA Change": {
          "transcript": "NM_000345.3",
          "ref": "C",
          "alt": "A",
          "position": "1407"
        },
        "Protein Change": {
          "ref": "L",
          "alt": "Q",
          "position": "467"
        },
        "Description in input context": "A53T mutation"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
I used the HGVS API to standardize the nomenclature of the variant. According to the literature, the A53T mutation corresponds to a change from leucine (L) to glutamine (Q) at position 467 in the protein.

**Described Disease**
```json
"Described Disease": {
  "Described Disease": "Parkinson disease",
  "MONDO": "MONDO:0005475"
}
```
I identified the disease studied in the literature as Parkinson disease and retrieved the corresponding MONDO term from the database.

**Experiment Method**

Since there are multiple experimental methods mentioned in the literature, I will extract information about each method separately.
