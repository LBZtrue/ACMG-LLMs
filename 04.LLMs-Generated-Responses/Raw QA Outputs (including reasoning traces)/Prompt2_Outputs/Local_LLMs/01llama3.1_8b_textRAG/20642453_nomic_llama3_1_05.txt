Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework.

**Variants Include**

* Gene: LRRK2
* Variants:
	+ HGVS: NM_024955.3:c.2748G>T (standardized via API)
	+ cDNA Change:
		- Transcript: NM_024955.3
		- Ref: G
		- Alt: T
		- Position: 2748
	+ Protein Change:
		- Ref: E923
		- Alt: V
		- Position: 983
	+ Description in input context: c.2748G>T (p.E923V)

**Described Disease**

* Described Disease: Parkinson's disease
* MONDO: MONDO:0005507

**Experiment Method**

* Assay Method: Western Blot
* Material used:
	+ Material Source: Cell line/Animal Model
	+ Material Name: Swiss 3T3 cells/mouse tissues
	+ Description: Endogenous LRRK2 isolated from Swiss 3T3 cells or various mouse tissues is associated with endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms.
* Readout type: Quantitative
* Readout description:
	+ Variant: NM_024955.3:c.2748G>T
	+ Conclusion: Abnormal
	+ Molecular Effect: partial loss-of-function
	+ Result Description: Mutation of Ser910 and/or Ser935 to disrupt 14-3-3 binding induces LRRK2 to accumulate within discrete cytoplasmic pools.
