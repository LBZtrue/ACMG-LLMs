Based on the provided literature, I will extract and standardize the relevant information according to the predefined JSON framework. Here is the extracted and standardized data:

Please note that I have only extracted and standardized the information for the variant NM_032989.3:c.1436G>T in the PINK1 gene, as it is the primary variant mentioned in the literature. If there are other variants discussed in the text, they would need to be extracted and standardized separately.
