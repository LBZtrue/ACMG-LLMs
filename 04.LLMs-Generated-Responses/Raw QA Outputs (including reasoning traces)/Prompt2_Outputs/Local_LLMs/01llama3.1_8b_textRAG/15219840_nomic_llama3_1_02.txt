Note that the "Threshold for normal readout" and "Threshold for abnormal readout" are not specified in the literature, so they are left blank. Also, the "Statistical analysis method" is not mentioned in the literature, so it's left empty. The "Approved assay" field indicates that the experimental protocol used in the literature is not generally used for studying Parkinson’s disease.
