```

Note that some fields, such as the threshold for normal and abnormal readouts, are left empty or marked as N.D. (not described) since they were not mentioned in the provided literature. Additionally, the crystallization method is considered an unapproved assay for studying Early-Onset Parkinson Disease (PARK7).
