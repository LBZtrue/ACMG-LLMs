Note that some fields may have been left blank or filled with "N.D." (Not Determined) as they were not explicitly mentioned in the literature. Additionally, some fields like "Validation controls P/LP" and "Validation controls B/LB" are set to "No" since there is no mention of validation controls for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants or benign/likely benign variants in the provided literature.
