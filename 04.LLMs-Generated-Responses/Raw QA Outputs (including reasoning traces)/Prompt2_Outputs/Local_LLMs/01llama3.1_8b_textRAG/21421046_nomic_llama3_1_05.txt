Based on the provided literature, I will extract and structure the required information according to the predefined JSON framework. Here is the extracted information:

```json
{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "PINK1",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_032979.4:c.1212A>G (p.E404G)",
          "cDNA Change": {

            "alt": "G",
            "position": "1212"
          },
          "Protein Change": {
            "ref": "E",
            "alt": "G",
            "position": "404"
          },
          "Description in input context": "PINK1 mutants are defective in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibiting ROS formation."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Parkinson's disease (PARK6)",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0005767"
  },
  "Experiment Method": [

      },
      "Readout type": "Qualitative/Quantitative",
      "Readout description": [
        {
          "Variant": "NM_032979.4:c.1212A>G (p.E404G)",
          "Conclusion": "Depolarized ΔΨm, fragmented mitochondria, and increased ROS formation",
          "Molecular Effect": "Loss-of-function",
          "Result Description": ""
        }
      ],
      "Biological replicates": {
        "Biological replicates": "Yes",
        "Description": "Three biological replicates were performed."
      },
      "Technical replicates": {
        "Technical replicates": "No",
        "Description": ""
      },
      "Basic positive control": {
        "Basic positive control": "Yes",
        "Description": ""
      },
      "Basic negative control": {
        "Basic negative control": "Yes",
        "Description": ""
      },
      "Validation controls P/LP": {
        "Validation controls P/LP": "No",
        "Counts": ""
      },
      "Validation controls B/LB": {
        "Validation controls B/LB": "No",
        "Counts": ""
      },
      "Statistical analysis method": {
        "Statistical analysis method": "Not mentioned"
      },
      "Threshold for normal readout": {
        "Threshold for normal readout": "",
        "Source": ""
      },
      "Threshold for abnormal readout": {
        "Threshold for abnormal readout": "",
        "Source": ""
      },
      "Approved assay": {
        "Approved assay": "Yes"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: Since the literature does not provide specific information on the thresholds for normal and abnormal results, I have left these fields blank. Similarly, the validation controls P/LP and B/LB are not mentioned in the literature, so I have also left these fields blank.

Also, note that the "Readout description" field only contains a single entry since there is only one variant mentioned in the literature. If multiple variants were mentioned, this field would contain multiple entries.
