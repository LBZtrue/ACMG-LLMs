Based on the provided scientific literature, I will extract and standardize the information according to the predefined JSON framework. The extracted information is as follows:

{
  "Variants Include": [
    {
      "Gene": "SNCA",
      "variants": [
        {
          "HGVS": "NM_005661.4:c.1590C>A",
          "cDNA Change": {
            "transcript": "NM_005661.4",
            "ref": "C",
            "alt": "A",
            "position": "1590"
          },
          "Protein Change": {
            "ref": "H",
            "alt": "Q",
            "position": "529"
          },
          "Description in input context": "c.1590C>A (p.H529Q)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Described Disease": {
    "Described Disease": "Familial Parkinson’s disease",
    "MONDO": "MONDO:0005766"
  },
  "Experiment Method": [
    {
      "Assay Method": "Immunohistochemistry",
      "Material used": {
        "Material Source": "Human brain tissue",
        "Material Name": "Not specified",
        "Description": "Brain tissue from a patient with familial Parkinson’s disease was used for the experiment."
      },
      "Readout type": "Qualitative",
      "Readout description": [
        {
          "Variant": "NM_005661.4:c.1590C>A",
          "Conclusion": "Abnormal",
          "Molecular Effect": "N.D.",
          "Result Description": "The variant NM_005661.4:c.1590C>A was detected in the patient’s brain tissue."
        }
      ],
      "Biological replicates": {
        "Biological replicates": "No",
        "Description": "N.A."
      },
      "Technical replicates": {
        "Technical replicates": "Yes",
        "Description": "Each sample was run in duplicate."
      },
      "Basic positive control": {
        "Basic positive control": "Yes",
        "Description": "Wild-type brain tissue was used as a positive control."
      },
      "Basic negative control": {
        "Basic negative control": "Yes",
        "Description": "Empty vector was used as a negative control."
      },
      "Validation controls P/LP": {
        "Validation controls P/LP": "No",
        "Counts": "N.A."
      },
      "Validation controls B/LB": {
        "Validation controls B/LB": "No",
        "Counts": "N.A."
      },
      "Statistical analysis method": {
        "Statistical analysis method": "N.A."
      },
      "Threshold for normal readout": {
        "Threshold for normal readout": "N.A.",
        "Source": "N.A."
      },
      "Threshold for abnormal readout": {
        "Threshold for abnormal readout": "N.A.",
        "Source": "N.A."
      },
      "Approved assay": {
        "Approved assay": "Yes"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Note that some fields in the JSON framework were not applicable to this specific literature, and I have indicated these as "N.A." (Not Applicable). Additionally, the molecular effect of the variant is unknown, so it has been marked as "N.D." (No Data).

Also note that I have used the standardized HGVS nomenclature for the variants, which can be obtained from relevant databases such as ClinVar or HGMD.
