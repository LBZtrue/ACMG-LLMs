### 解释：
1. **变异信息（Variants Include）**：提取了与LRRK2基因相关的两个变异G2019S和I2020T，并标准化了其HGVS命名。
2. **描述的疾病（Described Disease）**：确定文献研究的疾病为帕金森病（Parkinson's disease），并从MONDO数据库中检索到对应的术语MONDO:0005006。
3. **实验方法（Experiment Method）**：详细列出了两种实验方法（TR-FRET竞争结合测定和激酶活性测定），包括材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、生物和技术重复、对照设置、统计分析方法以及是否为公认的方法。

以上信息严格按照文献内容进行了提取和标准化，确保了数据的准确性和一致性。
