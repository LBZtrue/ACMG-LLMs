### 解释
1. **Variants Include**：提取了与DJ-1基因相关的五个变异（L166P、E64D、M26I、A104T 和 D149A），并标准化了它们的HGVS命名。
2. **Described Disease**：确定研究的疾病是帕金森病，并从MONDO数据库中获取了对应的术语。
3. **Experiment Method**：列出了文献中提到的实验方法（圆二色光谱和核磁共振光谱），并详细描述了每个方法的材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、实验重复、对照设置、统计分析方法及正常和异常结果的阈值。

### 注意事项
- 对于未在文献中明确提及的内容，使用"N.D."表示。
- 标准化HGVS命名通过相关API完成。
- 疾病术语从MONDO数据库中检索。
