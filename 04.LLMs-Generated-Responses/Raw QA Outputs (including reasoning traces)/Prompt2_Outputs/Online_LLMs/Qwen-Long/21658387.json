- **G2019S**: NM_198578.2:c.6055G>A (p.G2019S)
- **I2020T**: NM_198578.2:c.6058A>C (p.I2020T)

#### 2. 疾病识别与MONDO术语检索
文献中研究的疾病是帕金森病（Parkinson's disease）。对应的MONDO术语为：
- **MONDO:0005071** (Parkinson's disease)

#### 3. 实验方法提取
文献中提到的实验方法包括：
- **体外磷酸化实验**
- **GST pull-down实验**
- **Western blot分析**
- **RNA干扰（RNAi）实验**

#### 4. 组织和填充JSON格式信息
