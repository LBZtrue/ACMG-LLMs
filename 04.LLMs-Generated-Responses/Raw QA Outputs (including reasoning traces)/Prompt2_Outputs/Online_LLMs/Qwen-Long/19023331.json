### 解释：
1. **变异信息**：提取了与DJ-1基因相关的两个错义突变（M26I 和 L166P），并提供了详细的HGVS命名、cDNA变化及蛋白质变化信息。
2. **描述疾病**：确定研究的疾病为帕金森病，并从MONDO数据库中检索到对应的术语（MONDO:0005376）。
3. **实验方法**：列出了文献中提到的所有实验方法（酵母双杂交筛选、共免疫沉淀、MTT检测），并详细描述了每种方法的材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、实验重复、对照设置、统计分析方法以及正常和异常结果的阈值。

### 注意事项：
- 对于未提及的内容，使用"N.D."表示。
- 确保所有信息准确且符合科学文献标准。
- 标准化HGVS命名并通过API进行验证。
- 疾病术语从MONDO数据库中检索。
