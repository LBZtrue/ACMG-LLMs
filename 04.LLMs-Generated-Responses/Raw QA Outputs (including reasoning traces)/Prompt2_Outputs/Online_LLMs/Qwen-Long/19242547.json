从提供的文献中，我们可以提取并结构化以下信息。请注意，由于文档2未提供具体文献内容，这里仅基于文档1（即《19242547.pdf》）进行信息提取和标准化处理。

### 提取的信息

#### 文献摘要
该研究探讨了PINK1缺陷对线粒体功能、蛋白酶体功能以及α-突触核蛋白聚集的影响。PINK1基因的突变会导致常染色体隐性帕金森病（PARK6）。实验结果表明，PINK1缺陷导致线粒体呼吸功能障碍、ATP合成减少、蛋白酶体功能受损，并伴随α-突触核蛋白的异常聚集。

#### 变异信息提取与标准化
根据文献内容，涉及的主要变异为PINK1基因中的几个特定突变：Del 245、L347P 和 E417G。我们将这些变异信息提取并标准化如下：
