### 解释：
1. **Variants Include**：列出所有提到的基因变异，包括基因名称、HGVS命名、cDNA变化和蛋白质变化，并描述其在文献中的描述。
2. **Described Disease**：确定文献中研究的疾病，并从MONDO数据库检索相应的术语。
3. **Experiment Method**：列出所有实验方法，并详细提取每个方法的信息，包括材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、实验重复、对照设置、统计分析方法以及正常和异常结果的阈值。
4. **Approved assay**：判断实验方法是否通常用于研究该疾病。

请注意，对于未明确提及的内容，使用了"N.D."表示。此外，阈值和一些具体的实验细节是根据文献内容或个人知识进行推断的。
