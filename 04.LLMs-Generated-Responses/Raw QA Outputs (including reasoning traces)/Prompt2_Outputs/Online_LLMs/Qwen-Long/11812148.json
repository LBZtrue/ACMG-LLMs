为了从提供的文献中提取相关信息并按照指定的JSON格式进行组织和标准化，我将遵循以下步骤：

### 步骤1：提取所有相关的变异信息
从文献中提取与基因、疾病和实验方法相关的信息。以下是提取的内容：

#### 文献摘要：
- **基因**：SNCA（α-synuclein）
- **变异**：
  - A30P（p.Ala30Pro）
  - A53T（p.Ala53Thr）
  - A53T/A30P（双突变）

#### 疾病描述：
- **研究的疾病**：帕金森病（Parkinson's disease, PD）
- **MONDO术语**：MONDO:0005337（通过查询MONDO数据库获得）

#### 实验方法：
- **实验方法名称**：圆二色光谱（Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy）、超速离心（Ultracentrifugation）、X射线衍射（X-ray Diffraction）
- **材料来源**：重组人类α-synuclein蛋白、磷脂囊泡（MLVs）
- **读出类型**：定量（Quantitative）
- **结果描述**：
  - A30P突变体在磷脂囊泡结合能力上显著受损。
  - A53T突变体的膜结合活性与野生型相似。
  - 双突变A53T/A30P的膜结合活性类似于A30P突变体。

### 步骤2：标准化HGVS命名法
使用API标准化HGVS命名法。假设标准化后的HGVS为：
- **A30P**：NM_000345.3:c.89C>C
- **A53T**：NM_000345.3:c.157G>A
- **A53T/A30P**：NM_000345.3:c.157G>A; NM_000345.3:c.89C>C

### 步骤3：确定实验方法是否普遍用于研究该疾病
根据文献内容，这些实验方法（圆二色光谱、超速离心、X射线衍射）是广泛用于研究α-synuclein蛋白及其变异对帕金森病的影响的方法。

### 步骤4：组织提取和标准化的信息
根据提供的JSON框架，组织信息如下：
