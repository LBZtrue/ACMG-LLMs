为了从提供的文献中提取相关信息并按照要求生成JSON格式的输出，我将遵循以下步骤：

1. **提取所有相关变异信息**：包括基因名称、初步的HGVS命名法、cDNA变化和蛋白质变化。
2. **标准化HGVS命名法**：通过API进行标准化。
3. **识别文献中研究的疾病**：并从MONDO数据库检索相应的术语。
4. **列出所有实验方法**：并提取每种方法的详细信息，包括材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、实验重复、对照设置、统计分析方法以及正常和异常结果的阈值。
5. **确定实验方法是否通常用于研究该疾病**。
6. **组织提取和标准化的信息**：按照预定义的JSON框架。

以下是基于《16750377.pdf》的提取和结构化信息：
