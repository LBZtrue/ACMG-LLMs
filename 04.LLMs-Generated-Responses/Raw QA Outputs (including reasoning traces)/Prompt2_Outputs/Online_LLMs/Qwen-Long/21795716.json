为了从提供的文献中提取并结构化所需信息，我将遵循以下步骤：

1. **提取所有相关变异信息**：包括基因名称、初步HGVS命名法、cDNA变化和蛋白质变化。
2. **标准化HGVS命名法**：通过相关API进行。
3. **识别文献中研究的疾病**：并从MONDO数据库检索相应的术语。
4. **列出所有实验方法**：并提取每个方法的详细信息，包括材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、实验重复、对照设置、统计分析方法以及正常和异常结果的阈值。
5. **确定实验方法是否通常用于研究该疾病**。
6. **组织提取和标准化的信息**：按照预定义的JSON框架。

以下是基于《21795716.pdf》的提取和结构化信息：

### 解释：
1. **变异信息**：提取了与帕金森病相关的α-突触核蛋白（SNCA）基因的三个突变（A53T、A30P 和 E46K），并标准化了它们的HGVS命名法。
2. **疾病描述**：确定文献中研究的疾病为帕金森病，并从MONDO数据库检索到对应的术语“MONDO:0005361”。
3. **实验方法**：列出了三种实验方法（铁摄取测定、氧化应激测定和自噬测定），并详细描述了每种方法的材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、实验重复、对照设置、统计分析方法以及正常和异常结果的阈值。
4. **批准的测定**：确认这些实验方法通常用于研究帕金森病。
