### 解释：

1. **Variants Include**:
   - 提取了文献中提到的所有基因变异，包括 `PINK1` 和 `parkin` 基因的变异。
   - 标准化了 HGVS 名称，并提供了详细的核苷酸和氨基酸变化信息。

2. **Described Disease**:
   - 确定了文献中研究的疾病为帕金森病（Parkinson disease），并从 MONDO 数据库中检索了相应的术语。

3. **Experiment Method**:
   - 列出了文献中提到的所有实验方法，包括共免疫沉淀（Co-immunoprecipitation）、体外磷酸化（In vitro phosphorylation）和体内泛素化（In vivo ubiquitination）。
   - 对每种实验方法详细描述了材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、实验重复次数、对照设置、统计分析方法以及正常和异常结果的阈值。
   - 确认了这些实验方法是否通常用于研究该疾病。

通过这种方式，我们确保提取的信息准确且符合科学文献的标准。
