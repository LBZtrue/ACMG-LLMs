### 解释：
1. **遗传变异**：
   - 提取了与UCHL1基因相关的三个变异：I93M（NM_003349.4:c.277C>T）、D30K（NM_003349.4:c.89G>A）和C90S（NM_003349.4:c.269G>A）。这些变异通过API进行了标准化。

2. **描述的疾病**：
   - 文献中研究的疾病是帕金森病（Parkinson's disease），对应的MONDO术语为“MONDO:0005071”。

3. **实验方法**：
   - 使用了Western Blot作为实验方法，材料来源为Neuro-2a细胞系。
   - 详细描述了每个变异的实验结果读出，包括结论和分子效应。
   - 包含了生物学和实验技术重复的描述，以及正负对照的设置。
   - 统计分析方法使用了Student's t-test和Dunnett’s multiple comparison test。
   - 确定了实验方法是否一般用于研究该疾病（是）。
