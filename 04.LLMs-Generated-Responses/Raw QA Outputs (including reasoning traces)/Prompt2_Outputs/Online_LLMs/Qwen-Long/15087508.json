### 解释

1. **变体信息**：从文献中提取了与PINK1基因相关的两种突变：c.925G>A (p.G309D) 和 c.1560G>T (p.W437*)。这些变体与早发性遗传性帕金森病（Hereditary Early-Onset Parkinson's Disease）相关。

2. **描述的疾病**：文献研究的疾病是“早发性遗传性帕金森病”，对应的MONDO术语为“MONDO:0005071”。

3. **实验方法**：列出了文献中提到的所有实验方法，包括瞬时转染和免疫荧光显微镜、线粒体膜电位测定以及凋亡测定。每个方法都详细描述了材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、生物和技术重复、对照设置、统计分析方法以及正常和异常结果的阈值。

4. **批准的实验方法**：确定了这些实验方法是否通常用于研究该疾病。

通过这种方式，所有相关信息都被结构化并标准化，符合用户的高准确性和一致性要求。
