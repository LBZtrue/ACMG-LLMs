### 解释与说明
1. **Variants Include**：提取了文献中提到的SNCA基因中的A30P突变，并标准化为HGVS格式。
2. **Described Disease**：确定文献研究的疾病是帕金森病（Parkinson's disease），并从MONDO数据库中检索到对应的术语MONDO:0005371。
3. **Experiment Method**：列出了两种实验方法——Western Blot和行为测试，并详细描述了每种方法的具体信息，包括材料来源、读出类型、结果描述、实验重复、对照设置、统计分析方法及正常和异常结果的阈值。

请注意，某些字段如验证对照的数量（Validation controls P/LP 和 Validation controls B/LB）在文献中未明确提及，因此使用"N.D."表示。其他未明确提及的内容也遵循了相同的处理方式。
