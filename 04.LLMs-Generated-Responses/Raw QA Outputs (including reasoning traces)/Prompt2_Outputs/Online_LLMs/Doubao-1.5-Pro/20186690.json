The results from the four datasets have been combined by pooling the odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the inverse variance approach. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to adjust for the effects of age and sex, and for the two established polymorphisms p.G2385R and p.R1628P. An analysis of variance was used to assess the extent of phenotypic variation explained by each SNP."
