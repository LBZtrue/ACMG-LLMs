The G309 and L347 sites where recessive point mutations have been found are not predicted to be within the active site but in areas that may be important for protein folding. G309 is predicted to be in a loop near the PSTAIRE helix and the ATP binding site. A G309D substitution is unlikely to grossly destabilize the fold but could interfere electrostatically with ATP binding or hydrolysis. L347 is predicted to be in the middle of a PSTAIRE helix, a helical segment that forms part of the cyclin binding surface in the cyclin - dependent protein kinases."
