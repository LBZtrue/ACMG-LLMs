G309 is predicted to be in a loop near the PSTAIRE helix and the ATP binding site. A G309D substitution is unlikely to grossly destabilize the fold but could interfere electrostatically with ATP binding or hydrolysis. L347 is predicted to be in the middle of a PSTAIRE helix, a helical segment that forms part of the cyclin binding surface in the cyclin - dependent protein kinases."
