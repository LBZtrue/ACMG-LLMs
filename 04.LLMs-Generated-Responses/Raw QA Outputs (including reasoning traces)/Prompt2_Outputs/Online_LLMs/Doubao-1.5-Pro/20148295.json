E46K - syn and A53T - syn formed amyloid fibrils earlier and elongated faster than wild - type. The addition of liposomes lengthened the lag phase and slowed the rate of fibrillization of E46K - syn and A53T - syn, but did not measurably affect A30P - syn at a ratio of 2.5:1 lipids:αSyn. The 20S proteasome - produced fragments accelerated amyloid formation of the full - length mutant proteins. In the presence of both liposomes and 20S proteasome, all four αSyn proteins began forming amyloid fibrils at earlier times than when only liposomes were present, but the lag times were still longer than when only 20S was present."
