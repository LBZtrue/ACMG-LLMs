The pBudCE4.1 contains the ZeoR gene for efficient selection in mammalian cells with the selection agent Zeocin. The expression pattern of the two cDNA sequences in each of the plasmids was confirmed using semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Cells were lysed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the total RNA was isolated by chloroform/isopropanol precipitation. The RT reaction was carried out on 6 mg of RNA by using the Superscript First - Strand synthesis system for RT - PCR (Qiagen). The resulting single - stranded cDNA was used as a template to amplify the PINK1 cDNA using forward primer Com_PINK_Forward (5’ - CCGGACGCTGTTCCTCGTTATGAA - 3’) complimentary to the middle of the PINK1 coding region; and reverse primers Myc_PINK_Reverse (5’ - CAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAG - 3’) and V5_PINK_Reverse (5’ - CGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGA - 3’) complimentary to the c - myc and V5 tag sequences, respectively. The final products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel. To further confirm the expression pattern observed in the above experiment, quantitative PCR was carried out on the single - stranded cDNA using the Quantifast SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). cDNA from each cell line was subjected to a pair of reactions using a common forward primer Seq_PINK_Forward (5’ - ATCTGCCCGAGTAG - CCGCAAATGT - 3’) and specific reverse primers; Myc_PINK_ Reverse to quantify mutant PINK1 cDNA and V5_PINK_Reverse to quantify wild - type PINK1 cDNA, with the 7500 Fast Real - Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative cycle threshold (Cₜ) method."
