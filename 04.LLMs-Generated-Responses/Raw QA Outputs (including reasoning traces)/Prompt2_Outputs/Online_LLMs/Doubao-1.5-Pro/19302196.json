The tested kinase domain mutants LRRK2 G2019S and LRRK2 I2020T exert increased kinase activity towards MKK6. LRRK2 G2019S shows about 3 - 4 - fold increase in kinase activity compared with wild - type LRRK2, LRRK2 I2020T shows only a slight, but significant, increase of about 1.5 - fold of wild - type activity. The Roc - domain mutant LRRK2 R1441C showed no significant alteration in its kinase activity. MKK4 and MKK7 are phosphorylated by LRRK2 at their canonical activation residues, while MKK6 is not phosphorylated at these residues. LRRK2 phosphorylates MKK6 at its N - terminal lobe."
