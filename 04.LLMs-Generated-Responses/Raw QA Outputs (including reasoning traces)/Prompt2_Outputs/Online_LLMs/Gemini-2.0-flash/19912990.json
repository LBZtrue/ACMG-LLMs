Okay, I understand the requirements. I will act as an expert in biomedical literature mining and data standardization. I will extract the necessary information from the provided text, standardize the HGVS nomenclature using a hypothetical API (since I cannot access external APIs), retrieve disease terms from the MONDO database (using a hypothetical query), and format the output as a JSON object according to the provided structure. I will use "N.D." when information is not available in the text.

Here's the JSON output based on the provided text:

**Explanation and Assumptions:**

*   **HGVS Nomenclature:** I've used `NM_145947.4:c.6059T>C` as the standardized HGVS for the I2020T variant, assuming `NM_145947.4` is the correct transcript. If a real API were used, this would be validated and potentially corrected.
*   **MONDO Term:**  I've used `MONDO:0005180` for Parkinson's Disease. A real application would query the MONDO database.
*   **Material Description**: Included the cell culture conditions for both cell lines.
*   **Controls**: I have extracted the UT (untransfected cells) as negative control. If other types of controls are available, I will also extract them.
*   **Thresholds:** Since the literature does not explicitly state thresholds for normal and abnormal results, I have inferred them based on the experimental outcomes and general knowledge of cell viability and apoptosis assays. I've marked the source as "Custom" in these cases.
*   **Approved Assay:** I have set "Approved assay" to "Yes" for all assays as they are commonly used in Parkinson's Disease research.
*   **N.D. Fields:**  Fields marked as "N.D." indicate that the information was not directly present in the provided text.
*   **Result Description**: Added result descriptions based on the provided document.

This JSON object represents the extracted and standardized information based on the given text and constraints. I have made reasonable assumptions where data was missing, but a real-world implementation would benefit from access to external APIs and databases for more accurate standardization and data retrieval.
