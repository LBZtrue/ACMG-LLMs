### Explanation:
1. **Variants Include**: The variant E46K in the SNCA gene is extracted and standardized using HGVS nomenclature. The transcript number and cDNA/protein changes are detailed.
2. **Described Disease**: Parkinson's disease is identified as the studied disease, and the corresponding MONDO term is retrieved.
3. **Experiment Method**: The electrophysiological recordings of lipid bilayers are detailed, including the material source and description. The readout type is quantitative, and the result description includes the variant's molecular effect.
4. **Replicates and Controls**: Information on biological and technical replicates, as well as controls, is marked as "N.D." since the literature does not provide specific details.
5. **Statistical Analysis and Thresholds**: These fields are also marked as "N.D." due to a lack of specific information in the literature.
6. **Approved Assay**: The assay is marked as "Yes" since electrophysiological recordings are generally used for studying Parkinson's disease.

This JSON output provides a structured and standardized representation of the extracted information, aligning with the user's requirements.
