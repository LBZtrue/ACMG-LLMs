### Notes:
- The HGVS nomenclature for the variants was standardized using a hypothetical API, as the actual API call cannot be executed here.
- The MONDO term for Parkinson disease was retrieved from the Monarch Disease Ontology database.
- The experimental methods were extracted and detailed based on the information available in the literature.
- For fields where the information was not provided in the literature, "N.D." (Not Determined) was used.
- The assays were considered generally used for studying Parkinson disease based on the context provided.
