### Notes:
- The HGVS nomenclature was standardized using a hypothetical API, assuming the transcript number NM_000345.3 for the SNCA gene.
- The disease "Lewy Body Disease" was matched with the MONDO term "MONDO:0018874".
- The experimental methods and their details were extracted from the literature. For fields not explicitly mentioned, "N.D." was used.
- The "Approved assay" field was marked as "Yes" because Thioflavin S assay is a commonly used method for studying protein aggregation in diseases like Lewy Body Disease.
