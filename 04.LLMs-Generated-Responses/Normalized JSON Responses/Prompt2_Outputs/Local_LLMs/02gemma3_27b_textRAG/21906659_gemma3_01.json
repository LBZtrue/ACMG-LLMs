At high expression levels, no aggregation or cell death was observed for either protein. Inhibition of macroautophagy with 3-MA caused accumulation of wild-type alpha-synuclein and detectable aggregates, resulting in cell toxicity. Inhibition of the proteasome did not increase wild-type alpha-synuclein accumulation. 3-MA slightly increased toxicity of A30P without detectable aggregation."
