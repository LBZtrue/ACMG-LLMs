The specific telomere length assay used in the study was valid and widely accepted in the field, and the reduction in telomere length observed in patient cells suggests a functional impairment of telomerase assembly. However, due to the lack of direct OddsPath calculation, the strength of this evidence is considered supporting rather than very strong."
