It has been previously reported that L166P DJ-1 forms high molecular weight complexes which increase its apparent molecular weight when analyzed by gel filtration analyses. In the studies herein, L166P DJ-1 eluted in peak fraction 24, suggesting that it also forms high-molecular weight complexes in CHO cells. Interestingly, the peak elution for L10P DJ-1 was fraction 25, indicating that the L10P mutant adopts an apparent larger conformation than WT DJ-1 protein, even though it cannot form a homodimer. Conversely, P158DEL DJ-1 primarily eluted into fractions 27 and 28, suggesting that it is natively smaller in size than WT DJ-1 protein"

At 48 hours post transfection, the cells were cultured for an additional 12 hours in fresh DMEM with or without the addition of 20 µM MG-132."

However, nuclear and cytoplasmic DJ-1 positive inclusions were detected in a small percentage of L10P and P158DEL DJ-1 expressing cells (Figure 4A and C and data not shown). MG-132 treatment induced the formation of intranuclear and cytoplasmic DJ-1 positive protein inclusions in cells expressing L10P, L166P, and P158DEL DJ-1 but had little effect on cells expressing WT DJ-1"
