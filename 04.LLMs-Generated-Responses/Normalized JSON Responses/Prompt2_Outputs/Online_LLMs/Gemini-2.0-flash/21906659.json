As positive control (CT+), we cultured mock-transfected PC12/TetOn cells for 18 h in absence of serum to induce starvation. We noticed macroautophagy activation, with the appearance of LC3-II-positive spots in serum-starved and doxycycline-induced cells, with a stronger reactivity for the a-syn(WT) form in comparison with the mutated A30P. We have also checked whether macroautophagy was activated by the addition of doxycycline 0.1 µg/ml for 48 h, but no positive LC3-II reactivity was found (data not shown)."
