          "Conclusion": "The A30P mutant retains the ability to adopt both the broken helix and extended helix forms. At higher protein - to - lipid ratios, a distance distribution characteristic of unbound protein was observed for A30P in bicelles. In rod - like micelles, it has a maximally probable distance of 5.5 (ΔR 2.3) nm with a broader distance distribution.",

In LPPG micelles with spin labels at 24/61 positions, a single maximally probable distance of around 4.5 nm was found, indicating the broken helix conformation. In rod - like micelles at 450 mM SDS with spin labels at 24/61, a maximally probable distance of 5.5 (ΔR 2.3) nm was observed. In bicelles, at higher protein concentrations, it showed a distribution with a shorter maximally probable distance resembling unbound protein."
