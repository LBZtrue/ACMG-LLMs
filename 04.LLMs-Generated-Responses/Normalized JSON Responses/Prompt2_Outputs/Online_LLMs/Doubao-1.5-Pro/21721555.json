The expression and purification of recombinant wild type and mutant αSyn were as previously described. Solutions containing αSyn were dialyzed against ammonium bicarbonate before lyophilization and the freeze - dried αSyn stored at - 20 °C for fluorescence studies. Protein was dissolved in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4, NaCl 137 mM), filtered through a 100 kDa filter by centrifuging at 4 °C to remove big aggregates and the final protein concentration was around 140 μM with 20 μM ThT for fluorescence measurements."
