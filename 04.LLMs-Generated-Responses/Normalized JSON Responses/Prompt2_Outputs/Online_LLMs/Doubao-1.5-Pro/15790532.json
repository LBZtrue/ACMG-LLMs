The proportion of cells with mitochondrial DJ - 1 was similar basally between wild - type and mutant proteins but was increased by three - to four - fold in the presence of paraquat. Subcellular fractionation showed a two - fold increase in the amount of M26I DJ - 1 localized to the mitochondria in response to paraquat treatment."
