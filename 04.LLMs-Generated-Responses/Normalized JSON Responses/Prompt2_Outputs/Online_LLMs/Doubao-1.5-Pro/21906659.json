When exposed to doxycycline 0.1 μg/ml before oxidative challenge, a significant increase of cell viability was assessed. No difference was detectable between α - syn(WT) and (A30P) in this situation. No toxicity was recorded even at 96 h when strongly inducing α - syn expression with 1 μg/ml doxycycline, and this situation was the same for the WT and the mutated form. In PC12/TetOn cells expressing α - syn(WT), inhibition of macroautophagy led to an increase of cell toxicity, and the effect was stronger at doxycycline 1 μg/ml. In PC12/TetOn cells expressing the mutated A30P, a weak decrease of cell viability at doxycycline 1 μg/ml was detected."
