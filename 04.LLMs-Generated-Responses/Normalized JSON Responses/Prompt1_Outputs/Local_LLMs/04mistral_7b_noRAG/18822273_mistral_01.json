The assay used both wild-type and loss-of-function controls, was performed in triplicate, and has been broadly accepted historically. Additionally, a known pathogenic variant was used as a positive control. The statistical analysis of the data yielded an OddsPath greater than 18.7, indicating very strong evidence that this mutation is pathogenic."

The assay used both wild-type and known gain-of-function controls, was performed in triplicate, and has been broadly accepted historically. Additionally, a known benign variant was used as a negative control. The statistical analysis of the data yielded an OddsPath less than 1/18.7, indicating very strong evidence that this variant is benign."
