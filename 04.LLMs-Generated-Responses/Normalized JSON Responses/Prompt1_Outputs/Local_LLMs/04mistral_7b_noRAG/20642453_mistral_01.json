The specific instance of the assay has both basic controls and replicates, and variant controls were used. Statistical analyses were performed, allowing for the calculation of OddsPath, which was found to be very high (>18.7), indicating a very strong pathogenic effect."

    "overall_conclusion": "The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism relevant to the functional assay being described for this variant, and the general class of assay (gene expression) effectively models or reflects the disease pathogenesis/mechanism. The specific instance of the assay has both basic controls and replicates, but no variant controls were used. Statistical analyses were performed, though not enough to calculate OddsPath directly. However, there were at least 11 total benign/pathogenic variant controls across the entire study, which allows for a moderate pathogenic interpretation."
