While basic controls and replicates were not explicitly stated in the materials and methods or results sections, this assay has been accepted historically and previous validation is implied by the paper's description of experimental design. Variant controls were used in the study, a statistical analysis was performed, with an OddsPath value of 12.8 indicating moderate evidence supporting pathogenicity."
