    "variant": "GRID2",
    "evidence_source": "Jones et al., 2019 - Molecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports",
    "evidence_type": "Cell Phenotype Rescue Assay",
    "summary_of_findings": "The study by Jones et al. demonstrated that a novel GRID2 mutation (p.Ala409Val) disrupts the function of the GABAA receptor, leading to severe neurological phenotypes in vitro and in vivo.",
    "assay_description": "The researchers used a cell-based assay to evaluate the functional consequences of the GRID2 p.Ala409Val mutation on the GABAA receptor. They transfected HEK293 cells with either wild-type or mutated GRID2 and measured the response to GABA agonists.",
    "assay_controls": "Wild-type and empty vector controls were used in all experiments, as well as a known loss-of-function GRID2 mutant (p.Ala467Pro).",
    "assay_replicates": "The study reported that the assays were performed in triplicate.",
    "disease_mechanism_definition": "The paper defines the disease mechanism by showing that disrupted GABAA receptor function leads to severe neurological phenotypes, consistent with previous studies on GRID2 mutations and the pathogenesis of GABA receptor-related disorders.",
    "assay_validation": "The cell-based assay is a standard technique in the field for studying GABAA receptor function and has been widely used to investigate GABA receptor-related disorders.",
    "variant_controls": "Known pathogenic GRID2 variants (including p.Ala467Pro) were used as controls in the assays related to the GRID2 p.Ala409Val variant.",
    "statistical_analyses": "Statistical analyses, including t-tests and ANOVA, were performed on the functional data for the GRID2 p.Ala409Val variant.",
    "odds_path_calculation": "The study calculated an OddsPath value of 17.5 for the GRID2 p.Ala409Val variant, indicating a very high probability that it is pathogenic.",
    "overall_conclusion": "Based on the strong definition of the disease mechanism, the use of appropriate assays and controls, rigorous statistical analyses, and a calculated OddsPath value of 17.5 for the GRID2 p.Ala409Val variant, it is concluded that this variant likely has a very high probability of being pathogenic (PS3_very_strong)."
