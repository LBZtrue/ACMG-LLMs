This E46K-associated channelopathy was no longer observed when GM3 was present in phosphatidylcholine bilayers. This corrective effect was highly specific for GM3, since it was not obtained with the major brain ganglioside GM1 but was still detected in bilayer membranes containing both GM3 and GM1 . Moreover, synthetic GBD peptides prevented the interaction of α-syn proteins with GM3, thus abolishing the regulatory effects of GM3 on α-synmediated channel formation .",
