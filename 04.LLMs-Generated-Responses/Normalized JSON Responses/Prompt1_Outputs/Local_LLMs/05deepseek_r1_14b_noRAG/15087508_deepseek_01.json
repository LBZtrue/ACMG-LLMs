      "judgment": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The disease mechanism is clearly defined as a gain-of-function mutation in EGFR causing constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways."

      "judgment": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Cell phenotype assays are widely accepted as relevant for studying gain-of-function mutations like EGFR. This assay directly models disease pathogenesis by assessing oncogenic activity in a cellular context."

While the paper does not provide explicit OddsPath calculations, the significant results and proper controls suggest moderate supporting evidence for pathogenicity."
