DJ-1 encodes a 189 amino acid protein which is a member of the ThiJ/PfPI superfamily based on its structure. It is expressed in both neurons and astrocytes in the brain, but it is also expressed in many other organs.",

These findings, combined with the established role of DJ-1 in PD pathogenesis and the specific effects observed for this variant, strongly support a pathogenic designation."
