While the mutation doesn't lead to changes in b-strand arrangement and retains nano-second dynamics, the assay, in this instance, doesn't provide sufficient evidence to classify the variant as pathogenic. The findings suggest the mutation does not significantly alter the core structure of the fibrils, aligning with a supportive rather than definitive conclusion based on this assay."
