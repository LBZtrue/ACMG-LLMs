The use of loss-of-function controls (Dicer knockout, ago1 knockout) and gain-of-function controls (pathogenic LRRK2 expression) strengthens the relevance of the assay to the disease mechanism."

The significantly enhanced reporter expression upon pathogenic LRRK2 expression, compared to wild-type proteins, strongly implicates this variant in the disease pathogenesis."
