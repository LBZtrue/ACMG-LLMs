      "judgment": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The paper explicitly defines the disease mechanism (constitutive EGFR activation) and links it to the functional role of the EGFR protein in NSCLC."

      "judgment": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Both wild-type and loss-of-function controls were used, and experiments were repeated in triplicate. This meets the criteria for basic controls and replicates.",

The use of controls, replicates, and statistical significance supports a moderate PS3 evidence strength for this variant."
