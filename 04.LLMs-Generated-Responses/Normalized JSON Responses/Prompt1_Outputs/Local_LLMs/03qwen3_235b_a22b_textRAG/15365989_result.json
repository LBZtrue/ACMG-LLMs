While the study lacks detailed information about controls and replicates in the specific assay instance, dHPLC is a broadly accepted method for mutation detection, and DJ1 is a well-established Parkinson disease gene. The rarity of the variant in controls supports its potential pathogenicity, though additional functional studies would be needed to strengthen this evidence."
