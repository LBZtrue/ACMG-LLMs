      "assay_controls": "Wild-type (WT) and known loss-of-function (LoF) DJ-1 mutant proteins are used as controls. The study also includes a cell line stably expressing the Parkin protein, which is known to cause autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease.",

      "overall_conclusion": "The DJ-1 L166P mutation causes a loss of function, as it fails to rescue the parkinsonism phenotype in cells and does not support cell survival under stress conditions. The strong evidence from the cell phenotype rescue assay supports a pathogenic role for this mutation in Parkinson's disease."
