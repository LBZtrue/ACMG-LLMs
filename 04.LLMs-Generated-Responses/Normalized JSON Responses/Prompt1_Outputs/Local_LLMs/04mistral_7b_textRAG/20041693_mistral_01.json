Membrane association of RS likely mediates its role in regulation of reserve pools of synaptic vesicles and dopamine homeostasis, but it is also implicated in the fibril formation propensity (1-7) and oligomeric pathways (8-10) of RS, which have been widely studied for their relevance to Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD).",
