    "rationale": "The text explicitly links mutations in PINK1 and Parkin to impaired mitophagy, a key pathway in PD. While specific amino acid changes are not detailed, the functional impact of these mutations is clearly described, meeting ACMG criteria for pathogenicity. No benign controls or statistical thresholds are mentioned, but the direct mechanistic role of these genes in disease progression supports strong evidence."
