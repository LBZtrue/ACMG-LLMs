      "variant_string_id": "DJ-1:L166P",
      "evidence_strength": "PS3_supporting",
      "reason": "The variant is associated with reduced ability to prevent H2O2-induced cell death and ROS scavenging, as demonstrated by cell line studies. The study includes wild-type controls and shows that the mutant (L166P) lacks functional activity compared to wild-type DJ-1."

      "gene": "DJ-1",
      "protein_change": "M26I",
      "variant_string_id": "DJ-1:M26I",
      "evidence_strength": "PS3_supporting",
      "reason": "The variant is linked to reduced stability and functional activity (e.g., impaired ROS scavenging) in cell lines. The study shows that M26I, like L166P, fails to prevent cell death, indicating a pathogenic effect."

      "gene": "DJ-1",
      "protein_change": "C106S",
      "variant_string_id": "DJ-1:C106S",
      "evidence_strength": "PS3_supporting",
      "reason": "The variant is associated with no activity to scavenge endogenous ROS in cell lines, similar to L166P. The functional data indicates a loss of DJ-1's protective role against oxidative stress."

      "gene": "DJ-1",
      "protein_change": "D149A",
      "variant_string_id": "DJ-1:D149A",
      "evidence_strength": "BS3_supporting",
      "reason": "The variant retains normal activity to eliminate H2O2, as shown in cell line studies. This suggests a benign effect, as the functional capacity of DJ-1 is preserved compared to pathogenic variants."
