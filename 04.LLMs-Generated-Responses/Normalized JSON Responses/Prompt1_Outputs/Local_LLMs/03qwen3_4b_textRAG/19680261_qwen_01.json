      "reasoning": "The D149A mutation prevents DJ-1 from being processed by caspase-6, leading to resistance and subsequent p53-dependent cell death. The paper directly demonstrates this functional defect through experimental evidence, though no statistical analysis (e.g., OddsPath) is explicitly provided. The mutation is shown to abolish the protective function of DJ-1, aligning with the ACMG criteria for supporting pathogenic evidence."

      "variant_string": "DJ-1 L166P",
      "evidence_strength": "PS3_supporting",
      "reasoning": "The L166P mutation prevents DJ-1 dimerization but does not affect caspase-6 proteolysis. However, it still abolishes the antiapoptotic function of DJ-1, as shown in the study. While the paper does not provide statistical analysis (e.g., OddsPath), the functional defect is directly demonstrated through experimental validation, meeting the ACMG criteria for supporting pathogenic evidence."

  "summary": "Both mutations (D149A and L166P) in DJ-1 are associated with impaired antiapoptotic function, as shown by their resistance to caspase-6 processing or dimerization defects. The evidence supports their pathogenicity, though no OddsPath calculations are explicitly reported, leading to 'supporting' strength under ACMG guidelines."
