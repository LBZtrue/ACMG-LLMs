      "description": "Mutation of lysine at position 27 in the Uld domain. This variant disrupts the stabilizing role of the side chain NηH of Lys27, leading to increased structural fluctuation in β3 and β4 strands and the α1 helix. This structural instability is directly linked to impaired interaction with the proteasome.",
      "evidence_strength": "PS3_very_strong",
      "assessment": "The mutation directly affects critical structural elements (β3/β4 strands and α1 helix) required for proteasome interaction. The structural instability is explicitly linked to functional impairment, meeting ACMG criteria for pathogenicity."

      "variant_id": "Parkin_R33Q",
      "description": "Mutation of arginine at position 33 in the Uld domain. This variant increases structural fluctuation in β3 and β4 strands, disrupting the stability of the Uld domain. This is likely to impair the protein's ability to interact with the proteasome.",
      "evidence_strength": "PS3_very_strong",
      "assessment": "The mutation affects the same structural regions (β3/β4 strands) as K27N, leading to similar functional consequences. The structural instability directly impairs proteasome interaction, supporting pathogenicity."

      "variant_id": "Parkin_R42P",
      "description": "Mutation of arginine at position 42 in the Uld domain. This variant disrupts hydrogen bonding in the β4 strand, causing a large fluctuation in the β4 strand relative to β5. This structural change likely compromises the protein's functional conformation.",
      "evidence_strength": "PS3_very_strong",
      "assessment": "The mutation directly disrupts a critical hydrogen bonding interaction (Pro42 in wild-type), leading to structural instability. This is a clear functional impairment, meeting ACMG criteria for pathogenicity."

      "variant_id": "Parkin_K48A",
      "description": "Mutation of lysine at position 48 in the Uld domain. The paper does not explicitly link this variant to structural or functional changes, as it is not described in the context of structural instability or proteasome interaction.",
      "evidence_strength": "BS3_supporting",
      "assessment": "The variant is not directly associated with structural or functional changes in the paper. While the mutation is present, there is no explicit evidence of functional impairment, leading to a weaker benign classification."

    {
      "variant_id": "Parkin_V56E",
      "description": "Mutation of valine at position 56 in the Uld domain. This variant restricts spatial flexibility at the periphery of the α2 helix due to interactions between Glu56 and Ser19. This localized structural change may affect the protein's conformational dynamics.",
      "evidence_strength": "PS3_very_strong",
      "assessment": "The mutation directly affects the α2 helix, a structural element critical for maintaining the Uld domain's integrity. The restricted flexibility is linked to functional consequences, supporting pathogenicity."
