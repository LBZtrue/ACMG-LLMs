  "reasoning": "The clinical mutations in PINK1 are directly shown to cause functional defects in Complex I and mitochondrial function, with a clear rescue experiment demonstrating that wild-type PINK1 can reverse these defects. The absence of rescue in the mutant variants, combined with the known role of PINK1 in mitochondrial function, strongly supports pathogenicity."
