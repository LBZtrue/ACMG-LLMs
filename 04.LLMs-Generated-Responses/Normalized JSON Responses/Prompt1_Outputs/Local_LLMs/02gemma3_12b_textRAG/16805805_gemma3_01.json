We demonstrated that, on proteasome inhibition with MG-132, PINK1 and other mitochondrial proteins localized to aggresomes. Ultrastructural studies revealed that the mechanism was linked to the recruitment of intact mitochondria to the aggresome. Fractionation studies of lysates showed that PINK1 cleavage was enhanced by proteasomal stress in vitro and correlated with increased expression of the processed PINK1 protein in PD brain.",
