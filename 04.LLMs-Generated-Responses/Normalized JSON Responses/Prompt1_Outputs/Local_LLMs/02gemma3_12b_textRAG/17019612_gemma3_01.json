The glycine at position 2385 is a candidate site for N-myristoylation, and the Gly2385Arg variant replaces the hydrophobic glycine with the hydrophilic arginine, and increases the net positive charge of the LRRK2 WD40 domain.",

However, under condition of oxidative stress, the Gly2385Arg variant was more toxic and associated with a higher rate of apoptosis.",
