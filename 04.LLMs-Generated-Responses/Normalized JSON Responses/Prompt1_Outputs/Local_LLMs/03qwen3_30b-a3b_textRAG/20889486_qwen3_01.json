    "step_1": {
      "question": "Define the disease mechanism.",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The paper explicitly states that mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, and Parkin plays a critical role in mitophagy (mitochondrial quality control). This establishes a clear disease mechanism for the variant's functional impact."
    },
    "step_2": {
      "question": "Evaluate applicability of the assay.",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The functional assay assesses Parkin's ability to induce mitophagy after exposure to a mitochondrial uncoupler, directly linking the variant's functional defect to the disease mechanism."
    },
    "step_3": {
      "step_3a": {
        "question": "Basic controls and replicates?",
        "answer": "No",
        "reasoning": "The paper does not explicitly mention the use of both normal (wild-type Parkin) and abnormal (pathogenic variant) controls in the mitophagy assay. While the functional restoration by HSJ1a/DNAJB6 is noted, specific control details are not provided."
      },
      "step_3b": {
        "question": "Accepted/validated assay?",
        "answer": "No",
        "reasoning": "The paper does not reference prior validation of the specific mitophagy assay used for Parkin. While the role of chaperones like HSJ1a is biologically plausible, there is no explicit mention of the assay's standardization or prior use in the literature."
      },
      "step_3c": {
        "question": "Variant controls (pathogenic/benign)?",
        "answer": "No",
        "reasoning": "No known pathogenic or benign variants are explicitly used as controls in the study. The focus is on the C289G mutant and its rescue by chaperones, with no comparative analysis of other variants."
      }
    },
    "step_4": {
      "step_4a": {
        "question": "Statistical analyses (OddsPath)?",
        "answer": "No",
        "reasoning": "The paper does not provide quantitative statistical measures (e.g., p-values, OddsPath) to assess the pathogenicity of the C289G variant. The results are described qualitatively (e.g., 'restored mitophagy')."
      },
      "step_4b": {
        "question": "Number of benign/pathogenic controls?",
        "answer": "No",
        "reasoning": "No explicit count of control variants is provided in the study, making it impossible to determine statistical significance."
      }
    },
    "final_evidence": {
      "evidence_type": "N/A",
      "reasoning": "The paper lacks explicit controls, statistical validation, and prior assay standardization, preventing application of ACMG criteria for PS3/BS3. However, the functional defect (impaired mitophagy) and rescue by chaperones suggest pathogenicity, which would require further validation for classification."
