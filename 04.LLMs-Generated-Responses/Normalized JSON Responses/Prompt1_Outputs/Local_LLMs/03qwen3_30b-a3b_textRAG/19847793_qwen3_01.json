  "error": "The provided abstract and introduction do not specify individual amino acid variants (e.g., p.Gly386Arg) or detailed protein changes. The study only references mutations in broad domains (N-terminus, C-terminus, kinase domain) without explicit variant identifiers. Without specific variant details, the required 'protein change' fields (ref, alt, position) cannot be extracted. This limits the application of ACMG guidelines, which require precise variant definitions for interpretation."
