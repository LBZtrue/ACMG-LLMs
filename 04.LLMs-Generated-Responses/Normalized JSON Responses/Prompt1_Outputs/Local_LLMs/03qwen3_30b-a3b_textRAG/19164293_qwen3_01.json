    "step_1": {
      "question": "Define the disease mechanism.",
      "answer": "Yes. The paper states that fibrillization of Î±-synuclein is central to pathogenesis, and the A30P mutant affects fibrillization."
    },
    "step_2": {
      "question": "Evaluate applicability of the assay.",
      "answer": "Yes. Assays like electron microscopy, ultracentrifugation, and immunochemical analysis are relevant to fibrillization, a key disease mechanism."
    },
    "step_3": {
      "step_3a": {
        "question": "Basic controls and replicates?",
        "answer": "No. The text does not explicitly mention controls (e.g., wild-type or other mutants) or replicates in the described experiments."
      },
      "step_3b": {
        "question": "Accepted/validated assay?",
        "answer": "Yes. Techniques like electron microscopy and immunochemical analysis are standard in the field and referenced in the paper."
      },
      "step_3c": {
        "question": "Variant controls?",
        "answer": "No. The text does not mention using known pathogenic or benign variants as controls."

      "step_4a": {
        "question": "Statistical analyses (OddsPath)?",

      "step_4b": {
        "question": "Number of benign/pathogenic controls?",
        "answer": "Unknown. The text does not specify the number of controls used in the study."
