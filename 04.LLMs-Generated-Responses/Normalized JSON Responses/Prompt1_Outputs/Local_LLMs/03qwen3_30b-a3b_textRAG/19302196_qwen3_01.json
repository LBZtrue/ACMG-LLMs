    "step1": {
      "question": "Define the disease mechanism",
      "answer": "The paper states that LRRK2 mutations (e.g., G2019S) lead to increased kinase activity, which triggers neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration, directly linking the variant to PD pathogenesis.",

    },
    "step2": {
      "question": "Evaluate assay applicability",
      "answer": "The in vitro kinase activity assays (autokinase/phosphotransferase) directly measure the functional consequence of the variant, aligning with the disease mechanism involving kinase dysregulation.",

        "question": "Accepted/validated assay?",
        "answer": "The paper references prior studies (e.g., West et al. 2005) but does not explicitly state that the in vitro kinase assay is a standard or validated method in the field.",

However, no explicit controls, replicates, or statistical metrics are reported, limiting the evidence to 'supporting' strength."
