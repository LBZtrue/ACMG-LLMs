      "question": "Define the disease mechanism.",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "justification": "The paper states that LRRK2 mutations cause Parkinson's disease (PD), and the Gly2385Arg variant affects N-myristoylation, leading to toxicity under oxidative stress, which is linked to PD pathogenesis."
    },
    "step_2": {
      "question": "Evaluate assay applicability.",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "justification": "The transfection studies model protein aggregation and apoptosis, which are relevant to PD pathogenesis. The general class of assays (cell-based) is applicable."

      "step_3a": {
        "question": "Basic controls and replicates?",
        "answer": "No",
        "justification": "While controls (wild-type vs. Gly2385Arg) are present, the paper does not explicitly mention replicates in the transfection studies."

      "step_3b": {
        "question": "Accepted/validated assay?",
        "answer": "Yes",
        "justification": "Transfection studies are a standard method in the field, and the paper does not dispute their validity. The assay is considered accepted."

      "step_4a": {
        "question": "Statistical analyses for OddsPath?",
        "answer": "No",
        "justification": "The statistical analyses (ORs, p-values) in the case-control study are not directly tied to the functional assay data (aggregation/toxicity). The functional data lacks explicit statistical metrics."

      "step_4b": {
        "question": "Number of variant controls?",
        "answer": "Yes (2 total)",
        "justification": "The study uses Gly2385Arg (variant) and wild-type (control), totaling 2 variant controls. This is fewer than 10, so evidence strength is 'Max PS3_supporting'."
