  "interpretation": "The paper provides functional evidence that wild-type SNCA leads to downregulation of dopamine synthesis genes, a pathogenic effect. However, the specific variants (A30P and A53T) are not directly linked to this effect in the text. Their pathogenicity is inferred from their association with Parkinson's disease, but the functional data here does not conclusively support or refute their pathogenicity."
