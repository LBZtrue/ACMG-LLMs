Mutations in PINK1 lead to X-linked recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease, indicating its importance in mitochondrial quality control.

Including pathogenic and benign PINK1 variants as controls strengthens the interpretation. A PS3_moderate strength is assigned reflecting the reduction of kinase activity relative to controls and the inclusion of comparable variants."
