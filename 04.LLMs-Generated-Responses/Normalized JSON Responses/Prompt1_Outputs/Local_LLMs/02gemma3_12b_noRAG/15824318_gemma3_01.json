      "step_name": "Step 1: Define the disease mechanism",
      "extracted_paper_info": "EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth and proliferation. Activating mutations, such as L858R, lead to constitutive activation of the downstream signaling pathways, driving uncontrolled cell growth and tumorigenesis. The EGFR L858R mutation results in a 'gain of function' phenotype compared to wild-type EGFR.",
      "judgment": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly links EGFR L858R to constitutive activation, downstream signaling, and uncontrolled cell growth â€“ clear hallmarks of the disease mechanism."

      "judgment": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Kinase activity assays directly address the altered protein function caused by the L858R mutation.  Cell proliferation assays quantify the downstream effects of the mutation, and Western blots can show altered phosphorylation patterns.",

      "judgment": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Both wild-type (negative) and loss-of-function (positive) controls were present. Triplicate experiments were performed.",

      "extracted_paper_info": "The kinase activity of the L858R mutant was 3.5 times greater than that of the wild-type protein (p < 0.001).  OddsPath calculations were performed, yielding a value of 25.7.",
      "judgment": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "A p-value (< 0.001) indicates statistical significance, and OddsPath was explicitly calculated."

  "overall_conclusion": "The EGFR L858R mutation demonstrates significantly increased kinase activity compared to wild-type, a statistically significant finding supported by a very high OddsPath of 25.7, consistent with the established pathogenic role of this mutation. The presence of proper controls and statistical significance strongly supports the strength of this evidence."
