    "overall_conclusion": "The observed significant decrease in E3 ligase activity for the L1188P variant, combined with the use of appropriate controls and replicates, strongly suggests a pathogenic effect on protein function. While a quantitative OddsPath was not given, the statistically significant reduction in function supports its assignment as PS3 moderate."
