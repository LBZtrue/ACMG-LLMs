PINK1 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase which localizes in the inner mitochondrial membrane and appears to play a protective role against oxidative - stress induced apoptosis. The protective effect of PINK1 (HSP75) is mediated by phosphorylation of a mitochondrial chaperone protein, TRAP1, which in the phosphorylated form prevents translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. The PINK1 mutation can be directly responsible for the decreased mitochondrial cytochrome c content due to defective phosphorylation of TRAP1.",
