Mutations in PARK2, encoding Parkin, are linked to autosomal recessive juvenile onset Parkinsonism. Parkin functions as a ubiquitin - protein ligase and is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, including mitophagy, which is an important quality control mechanism for eliminating damaged mitochondria. Pathogenic Parkin mutants have been useful in delineating the steps of mitophagy.",

These assays model the processes of Parkin's relocation to mitochondria, mitochondrial clustering, and autophagy of damaged mitochondria, which are key aspects of the defined mitophagy mechanism.",
