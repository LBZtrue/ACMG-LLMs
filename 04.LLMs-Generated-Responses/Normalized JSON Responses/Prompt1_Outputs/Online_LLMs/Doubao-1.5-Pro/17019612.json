Mutations in the leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2, PARK8) are the most frequent known cause of familial autosomal dominant PD. Oxidative stress and ubiquitin proteasomal impairment are well - recognized features in various cellular and animal PD models and post - mortem human PD specimens. The generation of reactive oxygen species within neuronal cells may trigger specific signaling cascades determining cell survival or death.",
