Alpha - synuclein (α - syn) aggregation is involved in PD neurotoxicity, and the A30P mutation has been linked to familial PD. The physiological functions of α - syn include presynaptic plasticity, dopamine trafficking, etc. The A30P mutation affects dopamine vesicle trafficking, membrane interaction, and increases aggregation propensity.",

The disease mechanism of PD related to α - syn was clearly defined. The assays used were applicable to the disease pathogenesis. Although basic controls and replicates were not fully met, the assays are broadly accepted in the field, resulting in a PS3_supporting strength for the pathogenicity of the A30P variant."
