The finding that soluble recombinant α - syn readily polymerizes into ∼10 - nm filaments in vitro has provided critical evidence supporting the notion that α - syn is the building block of Lewy bodies and related pathological inclusions. These findings support the notion that aberrant α - synuclein polymerization resulting in the formation of pathological inclusions can lead to disease.",

The disease mechanism of abnormal α - syn polymerization was clearly defined. The assays used were applicable to the disease mechanism. Although basic controls and replicates were not fully met, the assays are broadly accepted in the field. Hence, the functional evidence strength for the E46K variant is PS3_supporting."
