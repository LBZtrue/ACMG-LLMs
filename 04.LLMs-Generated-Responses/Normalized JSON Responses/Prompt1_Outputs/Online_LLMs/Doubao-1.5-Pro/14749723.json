Various lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stresses contribute to the cascade leading to dopaminergic cell degeneration in PD. DJ-1 mutations have been shown to be responsible for the onset of familial PD, PARK7. The study aimed to determine the role of DJ-1 in PD and found that DJ-1 has a role in the antioxidative stress reaction and that mutations of DJ-1 lead to cell death, which is observed in PD.",
