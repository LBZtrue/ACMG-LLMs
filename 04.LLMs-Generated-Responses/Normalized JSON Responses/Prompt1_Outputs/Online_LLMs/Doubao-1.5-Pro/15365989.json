Genetic factors appear to play a major role in particular in patients with early disease onset. All of the gene products are related to the proteasome protein degradation pathway. The implication of mutant DJ1 in the pathogenesis of PD is not yet understood.",

Although the exact role of DJ1 in PD pathogenesis is not fully clear, there is sufficient indication of the disease mechanism related to gene mutations in general, which is relevant to the E64D variant in DJ1.",

These assays are relevant to understanding the function of the DJ1 protein and its role in PD pathogenesis as they can help determine if the mutation affects protein structure, expression, and dopaminergic function which are all related to the disease mechanism.",
