Mutations (A30P, E46K, and A53T) and gene duplication/triplications in R - synuclein (SNCA) are associated with rare hereditary forms of the disease. The mutant A53T isoform of R - syn causes an earlier onset of disease progression and has a higher propensity to aggregate or form toxic oligomeric structures than the WT form.",
