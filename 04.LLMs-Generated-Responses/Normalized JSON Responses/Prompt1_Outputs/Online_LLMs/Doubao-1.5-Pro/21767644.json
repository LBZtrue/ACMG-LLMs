Alpha - synuclein (α - syn) is a small presynaptic protein and major component of Lewy pathology. All described point mutations within the α - syn gene leading to familial PD are localized in the aminoterminal portion and possibly mediate cellular toxicity by a gain of function. Evidence implicates α - syn in neurotransmitter homeostasis as a negative regulator of dopamine (DA) synthesis, DA metabolism and DA release.",
