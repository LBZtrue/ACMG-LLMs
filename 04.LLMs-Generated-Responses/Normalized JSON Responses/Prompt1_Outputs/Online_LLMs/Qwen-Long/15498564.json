Recently, a third missense mutation (E46K) in α-synuclein was described in an inherited form of dementia with Lewy bodies.",

Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. ... Incubation of liposomes with GST bound to glutathione–agarose gave a figure for non-specific binding of approximately 12%, with the binding of wild-type GST-α-synuclein taken as 100%. Non-specific binding due to GST bound to beads was subtracted from total binding to give the specific binding of α-synuclein.\n\nStep 3c: Variant Controls: Mutation E46K increased the binding of α-synuclein to type A liposomes by 88% and to type B liposomes by 56%. Mutation A30P reduced the binding of α-synuclein to type A liposomes by 95% and to type B liposomes by 53%, whereas mutation A53T led to a non-significant 9–12% reduction in the binding of α-synuclein to both liposome types.",
