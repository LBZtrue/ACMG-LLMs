The disease mechanism is well-defined, linking SNCA mutations to PD via altered expression and aggregation. The expression assays are applicable to PD pathogenesis, and basic controls with replicates were used. However, the lack of variant-specific controls (known pathogenic/benign variants) limits the strength to supporting level for pathogenicity, as the assay could not be further validated against a broader variant context."
