The triplication of α-syn gene has been linked to early-onset familial PD, suggesting that the cellular dosage of α-syn is an important modulator of its toxicity.",

          "reasoning": "The paper clearly defines the disease mechanism for PD as involving α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity, with the A30P mutation accelerating aggregation and contributing to neurotoxicity. The role of protein dosage further supports the molecular basis of PD pathogenesis."

However, the lack of additional variant controls limits the strength to supporting level. Key findings include the loss of neuroprotective function against oxidative stress at high expression levels for A30P compared to WT, and slight toxicity upon degradation pathway inhibition, suggesting a pathogenic role."
