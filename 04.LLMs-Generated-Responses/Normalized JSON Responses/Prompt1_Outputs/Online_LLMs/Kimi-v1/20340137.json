This phenomenon is suggested to have important implications for PD pathogenesis. However, due to insufficient details on specific assay methodologies and statistical analyses, a full ACMG functional evidence evaluation cannot be completed, and the strength of the evidence cannot be definitively rated according to ACMG guidelines."
