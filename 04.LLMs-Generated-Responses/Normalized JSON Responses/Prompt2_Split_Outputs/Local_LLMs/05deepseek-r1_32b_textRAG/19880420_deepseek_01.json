  "Description in input context": "mutations in PINK1 or parkin cause autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson disease (PD). Homozygous mutations in parkin are the most common cause of early-onset familial PD. Homozygous mutations in PINK1 are the second most common cause of early-onset recessive PD. Heterozygous mutations in parkin or PINK1 have been implicated as significant risk factors in the development of late-onset PD."
