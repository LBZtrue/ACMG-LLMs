      "Description in input context": "The Gly2385Arg variant replaces the hydrophobic glycine with the hydrophilic arginine, and increases the net positive charge of the LRRK2 WD40 domain. This variant was associated with increased risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD) in Chinese populations from Singapore and Taiwan, with an odds ratio of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1–3.9) and a population attributable risk (PAR) of ~4%. Functional studies showed that the variant was more toxic under oxidative stress, leading to higher apoptosis rates compared to the wild-type protein."
