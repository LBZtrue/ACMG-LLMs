      "Description in input context": "A30P mutation accelerates nucleation-dependent fibrillization of wild type α-synuclein, induces distinct conformational changes in fibrils, and is associated with Parkinson disease despite its slow fibrillization. A30P fibrils act as seeds for WT α-synuclein fibrillization, and the mutation affects both WT and A30P fibril conformation."
