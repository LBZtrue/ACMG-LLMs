      "Description in input context": "PARK2 mutations are associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease and multiple somatic mutations have been identified in cancers. These mutations occur in the same regions as germline mutations causing familial Parkinson's disease. Cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects of the PARK2 protein by reducing its E3 ligase activity, leading to mitotic instability."
