      "Description in input context": "The E46K mutation was described as a missense mutation in the a-synuclein gene. It caused increased ability of a-synuclein to bind to negatively charged liposomes and increased rate of filament assembly similar to A53T mutation, resulting in twisted filaments with cross-over spacing of 43 nm."
