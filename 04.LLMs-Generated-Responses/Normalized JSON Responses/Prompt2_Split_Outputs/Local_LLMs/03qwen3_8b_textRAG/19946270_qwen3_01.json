Mutations occur in the same domains and sometimes at the same residues as germline mutations causing familial Parkinson's disease. Cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects of PARK2, decrease E3 ligase activity, and impair ubiquitination of cyclin E, leading to mitotic instability."
