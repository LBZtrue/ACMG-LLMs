      "Description in input context": "I2020T is a PD-associated mutant with lower kinase activity in substrate phosphorylation assays but higher activity in autophosphorylation assays. It exhibits 10-fold greater resistance to ATP-competitive inhibitors at 1 mM ATP and 6-fold higher ATP affinity compared to wild-type."
