      "Description in input context": "Mutants in the N-terminus, C-terminus, and kinase domain were generated. Cell lines expressing kinase and C-terminus mutants exhibited greater apoptosis and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) under oxidative stress. Two copies of kinase mutants showed greater apoptosis and ΔΨm decrease than one copy. Heterozygous/homozygous mutations exerted gene dosage effects, with decreased cell survival in mutant-expressing cell lines compared to wild-type."
