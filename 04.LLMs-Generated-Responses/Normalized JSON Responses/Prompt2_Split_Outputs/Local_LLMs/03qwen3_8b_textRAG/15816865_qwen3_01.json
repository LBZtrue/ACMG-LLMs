      "Description in input context": "A significant number of parkin point mutants (22 in total), representing the majority of parkin missense/nonsense mutations reported to date. More than half of these mutations, including many located outside of the parkin RING fingers, produce alteration in the solubility of parkin which influences its detergent extraction property. Mutation-mediated alteration in parkin solubility is also associated with its propensity to form intracellular, aggresome-like, protein aggregates."
