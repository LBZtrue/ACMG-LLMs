      "Description in input context": "41 PD-associated LRRK2 mutations were analyzed for their effects on kinase activity, Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation status and 14-3-3 binding. Mutations led to increased kinase activity (Group 1), reduced phosphorylation/binding with cytoplasmic accumulation (Groups 2/3), or other effects."
