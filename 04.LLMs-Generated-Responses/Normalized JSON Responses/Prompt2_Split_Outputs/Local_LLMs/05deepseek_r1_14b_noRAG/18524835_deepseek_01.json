    "description": "Other point mutations affecting mitochondrial genome-encoded subunits (ND) can result in structural and functional defects in complex I. These mutations may predispose patients with PINK1 mutations to impaired responses to mitochondrial stress, contributing to dopaminergic neuron degeneration."
