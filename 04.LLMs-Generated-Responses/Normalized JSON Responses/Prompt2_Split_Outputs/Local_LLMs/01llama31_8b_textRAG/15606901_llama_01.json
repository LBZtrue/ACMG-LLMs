      "Description in input context": [
        "Deletion of the C terminus abrogated the association of parkin with cellular membranes and induced rapid misfolding and aggregation.",
        "Four N-terminal missense mutations, located within the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), decrease the stability of parkin; as a consequence, these mutants are rapidly degraded by the proteasome.",
        "A smaller parkin species of 42 kDa, which is present in extracts prepared from human brain and cultured cells, originates from an internal start site and lacks the N-terminal UBL domain."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Description": [
    "Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the loss of function of parkin due to various mutations.",
    "The parkin gene encodes a 465 amino acid protein with an ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) at the N terminus and two RING finger motifs close to the C terminus."
