      "Description in input context": "The MD simulations showed the K27N and R33Q mutations increase the structural fluc-tuation of these β strands including the α1 helix. Reversely, the V56E mutant restricted the spatial flexibility at the periphery of the short α2 helix by the interactions between the polar atoms of Glu56 and Ser19 residues. However, a large fluctuation of β4 strand with respect to β5 strand was induced in the R42P mutant, because of the impossibility of forming paired hydrogen bonds of Pro for Arg42 in wild Uld."
